INTRODUCTION

* Directors UK is the professional association for film, television and all moving image directors in the UK. The organisation is both a collecting society for the distribution of secondary rights payments to directors, and the professional association providing services and support to its members.  It seeks to protect and enhance the creative, economic and contractual rights of directors in the UK and works closely with organisations in the UK, Europe and around the world to represent directors' rights and concerns. With over 5,000 members it represents the overwhelming majority of working film and television directors in the UK.

* Directors UK is a member of the British Copyright Council and a member of Society of Audiovisual Authors (SAA); Directors UK was the SAA representative on the EC stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe", working group on the audio visual sector and cultural heritage. 



II. RIGHTS AND THE FUNCTIONING OF THE SINGLE MARKET

* Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.  
[Open question]
In the UK, as in the rest of the EU's audiovisual sector, it is usual practice for authors to assign their rights for the whole world to the producer who finances the work. They expect their works to be exploited globally via the producer who can license the exploitation rights for various modes of exploitation and territories.  The trouble is that most audiovisual authors are in an inferior bargaining position compared with producers and are rarely able to control the distribution of their works or receive fair remuneration for the exploitation of their works. 
The European film and audiovisual sector is fragmented into several markets based on languages and types of exploitation of the works.  Most audiovisual media services, including online, target specific markets. These services therefore do not request multi-territorial licences.
As far as multi-territorial online services are concerned, one can distinguish two categories:
* Online services that are operated by traditional players as a complement to their offline activities (broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV and BSkyB, and telecom or cable operators such as BT and Virgin). Licences for these online services are usually dealt with as an extension of their licences for offline activities. The multi-territorial dimension is usually limited to some public service broadcasters willing to be available for their nationals living abroad.

* Online services operated by pure internet players such as iTunes, Netflix, LoveFilm (Amazon), YouTube, etc. These services are now available in several countries but most of them reached their actual scope through country by country development and continue to operate on this basis. They tend to provide localised versions of their services in each market which are not available cross-border. In theory, they could be interested in multi-territorial licences, but in practice, our experience is that this is not the case.
Because there is no harmonisation of the intervention of collective rights management in the audiovisual sector, in particular for authors' rights, only a few audiovisual authors' CMOs (in Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland) are able to clear online rights for their repertoire. In other countries, online rights are individually managed.
Because SAA's audiovisual authors' CMOs want the works of their members (screenwriters and directors) to be widely accessible on online services, they established at the end of 2011 a working group called FRAME to develop a multi-territorial online offer for digital service providers (DSPs) active in more than one European country. Their objective was to offer a multi-territorial agreement for the use of their aggregated repertoires and to license every European platform operator under the same conditions and under strict application of the principle of equal treatment. All platforms would get access to the FRAME repertoire, whether they exploit it in all of the countries or only in some. The remuneration would be calculated according to the principle of the country of destination.
15 audiovisual authors' CMOs (including Directors UK) cooperated in the FRAME project to develop a model for the collection and distribution of audiovisual authors' remuneration for the online exploitation of their works. In doing so, they were faced with three main obstacles:
1/ Only a few audiovisual authors' CMOs are today entitled to clear the online rights for their repertoire. This reduces the interest for DSPs of such a multi-territorial licence. This lack of harmonisation of the intervention of audiovisual authors' CMOs is an obstacle to pan-European online rights clearance for European audiovisual works.
2/ Competition issues: the Commission is unclear about the cooperation possibilities between CMOs and usually prefers to encourage competition between multiple entities rather than collaboration between them. Via the FRAME working group, audiovisual authors' CMOs worked together to try to create a very simple, easy-to-use portal, which would have been helpful to both authors, DSPs and ultimately consumers. However, EU competition rules jeopardize the achievement of this project by requiring that CMOs compete rather than cooperate.
3/ Double taxation of royalties: there is no harmonisation of the tax treatment of cross-border royalty payments between Member States in the various Double Tax Treaties. If CMOs from different Member States develop a common licensing platform, they expose their members to an additional layer of withholding tax that can reach an overall taxation of 60%.
We urge the Commission to include a search for a resolution to these problems in this work programme. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above  -  what would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
1/ The lack of a harmonised framework for audiovisual authors' remuneration makes it impossible for their CMOs to offer DSPs pan-European licences. There is therefore an urgent need to provide audiovisual authors with a harmonised guarantee of remuneration for the online exploitation of their works that can be exercised by their CMOs. This should take the form of an unwaivable and inalienable right to remuneration (see answers to questions about fair remuneration of authors and performers), enforced through a scheme where CMOs are made responsible and accountable for collecting the remuneration at the level of the final distributors. 
In the audiovisual sector, after the initial transfer of the authors' making available right to the producer, this right is very often split territorially and transferred again and again to many different operators such as sales agents, distributors, broadcasters, etc. The contractual chain back to authors is then so long, complex and easily broken if one element of the chain experiences difficulties (e.g. an intermediary going out of business) that the authors rarely see any remuneration linked to the exploitation of the work. 
Collective management of the right to remuneration should therefore be encouraged so as to guarantee that the online exploitation of audiovisual works will benefit their authors and help consumers and users to identify the right place to obtain a secure and fair licence.
2/ Cooperation between audiovisual authors' CMOs should be encouraged to develop pan-European licences. 
In this context, Directors UK agrees with SAA and welcomes the 12 April 2013 CJEU judgments against the Commission's decision in the CISAC case in which the Court concluded that the Commission had not adduced sufficient evidence of a concerted practice between CISAC societies. 
3/ Another major problem in facilitating cross-border licensing of works is the way in which the system of tax treaties operates in Europe. The tax system on royalties makes it extremely complex to develop initiatives such as FRAME as it remains within the scope of the network of different double tax treaties. This raises three specific issues: 
* Different rates, required documentation and conditions are attached to each treaty;
* Complex to operate and resolve problems: issues have to be addressed directly to the tax authorities in other countries rather than centrally. Response times can be very slow;
* The administration of tax returns for individuals who receive royalties from foreign societies can be very complex.
There is an urgent need for the Commission to come up with a fair answer on this issue of double-tax treaties in order to facilitate cross border availability of works.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
YES - Please explain
Legislative solutions:
European legislation is needed to ensure that audiovisual authors are remunerated for the online distribution of their works, independently of the country of production and exploitation. With such a level playing field, authors' collective management organisations, responsible and accountable for managing the making available remuneration of audiovisual authors could develop one-stop-shops to offer a more convenient and secure single licence or entry point to online operators. This will, in turn, make it easier for them to pay the remuneration due to the European audiovisual authors of the works in their catalogue. We call on the Commission to ensure that audiovisual authors are remunerated for the on-demand exploitation of their works whatever the country of exploitation (please see details in our responses to Q.72-74 below).
In the digital age there are so many opportunities to make works available to audiences that there is no excuse for a lack of effort by producers and their distributors in exploiting works within their control.  An obligation to exploit the rights held in a work (use it or lose it principle) should be introduced to generate a strong incentive for these intermediaries to make the works available. If there has been no exploitation of a work for a period of time, then the authors' rights should revert back to them so that they can exploit their rights themselves. This would also help unlock cultural heritage works. 

Finally, a reduced VAT rate for on-demand audiovisual works is a necessity for the development and take-up of online services: only cinema tickets and broadcasting currently benefit from a reduced VAT rate so far. When delivering the same audiovisual works on VOD and catch-up TV (and on DVD), audiovisual media services cannot apply a consistent reduced VAT rate. It is essential to allow Member States to apply a reduced VAT rate for all audiovisual works independently of their delivery method and in particular in the online environment. Such a reduced rate would boost the online market twofold: by competing on price with physical products and by drawing consumers away from illegal services.
Non-legislative solutions/market-led solutions: 
Market-led solutions already exist and will continue to develop. As underlined at the plenary of the Licences for Europe stakeholders' dialogue on 13 November 2013, in the Joint Statement on "Cross-border Portability of lawfully-acquired content" of the audiovisual subgroup of Working Group 1, "market-led initiatives are already a reality in addressing demand for away-from-home consumption of different types of content, including a growing number of innovative consumer options" 
In addition, we commend the suggestions provided in the SAA's response to Q.1 of the 2011 Commission Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works to help market operators address the digital single market for audiovisual works.
Finally, the freedom to provide cross-border services set out in Article 56 TFEU is a fundamental freedom which is central to the effective functioning of the EU internal market. However, a freedom is not an obligation. For commercial operators, it has to correspond to a market demand. 
To assess this market demand, the European Commission commissioned a report by Plum Consulting in March 2012 on the economic potential of cross-border pay-to-view and listen audiovisual media services. This report identified 3 types of population group that may be interested in cross-border audiovisual media services: migrant populations, people with proficiency in or learning non-national languages and people travelling within the EU. The report estimated the potential consumer demand for pay-to-view cross border audiovisual services of between Euro760 million and Euro1,610 million annually in the EU. This compares to a total EU pay-TV market size of Euro28.6 billion in 2009.

This suggests to us that potential revenues are not limitless, and there will be a need to keep the costs and overheads attached to greater cross-border access under tight control to ensure economic viability.  This further emphasises the importance we attach to initiatives like harmonisation of cross-border taxation arrangements.

* Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

* The act of "making available"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations  -  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  -  sufficiently clear? 
YES
The scope of the making available right is clear enough from a practical point of view. 
However, the making available right itself should be clarified by introducing an unwaivable right of authors to remuneration for their making available right, even when exclusive rights have been transferred, so that authors are guaranteed a financial reward proportional to the real exploitation of their works (please see details in our response to Qs. 72-74 below).  Otherwise we fear that this right will be "bought out" by producers and no value will be received by the authors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?
NO
We do not think that a clarification of the territorial scope of the making available right would have any impact on the recognition of the authors' rights, the possible transfer of rights and their remuneration. These issues are mainly dealt with in legislation and authors' contracts. The only way to address the current problems related to these issues is to tackle them directly through harmonisation and not through the territorial scope of the making available right. 

2. Two rights involved in a single exploitation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you? 
NO
In the audiovisual sector, there is no conflict since both sets of rights (reproduction right and making available right) are usually managed by the same entities.

3. Linking and browsing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
YES  -  Please explain

The provision of a hyperlink can encompass many indexing methods such as access, framing or embedding. A hyperlink is not however a mere digital reference which only gives information on content like a footnote; it gives access to the content and it makes it available to the public.
 
In principle, the provision of a hyperlink should require an authorisation. This is particularly true for `embedded' or `framed' links within websites (to legal and illegal sources) especially if there is commercial gain. In the case of embedded and framed links, the digital service operator is considered as an organisation which "intervenes, in full knowledge of the consequences of its actions, to give access to the protected work to its customers" (CJEU, 7 December 2006, C-306/05 (Rafael Hoteles) para. 42).  Providing a hyperlink to a protected work whose communication to the public has not been authorised is clearly a copyright infringement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user's computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder? 
NO  -  Please explain

From the consumer's perspective, pure viewing does not need the authorisation of the rightholder since temporary reproductions are covered under a mandatory copyright exception. However, it does not mean that streaming services do not need an authorisation. As any other on-demand service, streaming services of audiovisual protected works need an authorisation for the making available of works to the public. In addition, when the reproduction comes from an obviously illegal platform, the temporary reproduction should be prohibited (as per the ruling in the kino.to case in Germany where the notorious German streaming portal site offering links to illegal films and TV series was shut down and the people behind the portal prosecuted). 

4. Download to own digital content (resale of digital files)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
Providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content would raise more problems than it solves. One of the most important problems would be to ensure that no copy of the work purchased is kept by the first owner. The new `forward and delete' technology (which erases the first copy from the seller's hard drive) could be seen as a solution to push for the establishment of such a legal framework. However, a number of issues would have to be carefully considered. For example, whether rightholders would be ensured a fair proportion from the proceeds from re-sales, whether it would be feasible to obtain rightholders' authorisation for each act of resale, whether the first sale doctrine should apply in the digital context to content other than software, the meaning of a "copy" for copyright purposes (i.e. if the new copy made on the reseller platform amounts to an infringement of the reproduction right), etc.

In addition, exhaustion is not the way to deal with the possible resale of digital files. The current Copyright Directive does not allow the application of the exhaustion principle to intangible goods (Recital 29 and Art 4(2)). Accordingly, sellers must obtain copyright holders' approval before any act of resale and the resale market is prevented from having a detrimental impact on the primary market of the goods in question. That was the conclusion of the judge in a German ruling on downloads of ebooks and audiobooks and in a US case (`ReDigi') on digital music resales. The German court reiterated that the CJEU in the `UsedSoft' case (C-128/11) considered that the reasoning applicable to software (to which digital exhaustion applied) in that case was a special case which applies when the Software Directive applies but is not applicable to other digital content. 

* Registration of works

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of works and other subject matter? 
NO


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system? 

We believe such a project would be extremely costly and a massive drain on the resources of all involved.  It would be far better to develop networks using the many existing rights registries and databases, by creating a type of ARROW project for the audiovisual sector. Such a tool could be based around ISAN, the audiovisual works' identifier (see answer to Q.19).


* How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
[Open question]
We agree with the statement in the Declaration on audiovisual work identifiers which was presented at the Licences for Europe plenary meeting on 13 November 2013. The Declaration recognised that 1) "common use of standard and interoperable audiovisual work identifiers would facilitate the process of rights clearance, distribution for online availability, and discoverability of European works" and 2) "such identifiers should notably be implemented for all new European works that are produced to facilitate rights management, digital distribution, and discoverability". 
In a world of multiple exploitations of audiovisual works on different media in different countries, work identification systems are an absolute necessity. This is why audiovisual authors' collective management organisations collaborated on the development of ISAN, the International Standard Audiovisual Number.  ISAN provides a unique, internationally recognised and permanent reference number for each piece of audiovisual content registered. ISAN is being used in production and distribution systems and to drive broadcast transmission systems (e.g. ITV in the UK), facilitating interoperability and information exchange that contributes to improving rights management. ISAN is key to content tracking and monitoring, and has been integrated in several watermarking and fingerprinting technologies. 
Collective management of rights relies on identification systems and databases. ISAN is being integrated into the databases of audiovisual authors' CMOs containing information on the works, their authors and other rights holders. Audiovisual authors' CMOs have also developed IDA (International Documentation on Audiovisual Works), a worldwide centralised database for audiovisual works that contains accurate information on audiovisual works and their rights owners. This global database manages original productions, versions and adaptations in other languages and formats. Each work registration contains a minimum set of information: original titles, foreign titles, subtitles, production companies, year and country of production, shooting languages, ISAN number, a unique IDA code, as well as detailed information on rights owners such as their name, their international identifier (IPI -Interested Party Information) and their respective share in the work.
The audiovisual authors' CMOs use IDA to identify foreign audiovisual production and rights-owners before distributing the royalties to the relevant identified sister organisations. The sister organisation itself will transfer these royalties to their authors. The unique IDA code is used between CMOs when exchanging information on an audiovisual work. Before IDA, authors' CMOs sent requests by e-mail or mail to sister societies, meaning paperwork and rather long identification processes. IDA facilitates their identification and the exchange of documentation between CMOs and accelerates the transfer of payments between CMOs. 
Such a centralised system is built for the specific needs of audiovisual authors' CMOs; IDA references are non-public identifiers but the database is interoperable with existing tools such as ISAN. IDA is a CISAC tool (the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers) and is a part of the CISAC Professional Rules and the Binding Resolutions for audiovisual authors' CMOs, rules that aim to improve transparency and quality of service for all CISAC members. 
Any action from the Commission to generalise and accelerate the use of this standard by all users of audiovisual works would be welcome.
What might be lacking today is a portal giving some public information and visibility to these tools and how they work together. The European Union could facilitate the building of such a portal.
Finally, and as mentioned in our answer to Q.17, we are ready to examine how our databases and others could be linked to ensure that more works are made publicly accessible and to help the discoverability of works. 

* Term of protection  -  is it appropriate?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?

Yes - Please explain
The 1993 Directive harmonising the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights recalled that the Berne Convention lays down only minimum terms of protection, leaving Contracting States free to grant longer terms (recital 1). As certain Member States had exercised this entitlement, the resulting differences between national laws were considered as distorting competition in the internal market which justified harmonisation so as to make terms of protection identical throughout the Community (recital 2).
The Directive recalls that the minimum term of protection laid down by the Berne Convention (life of the author and 50 years after his death) was intended to provide protection for the author and the first two generations of his descendants and considered that the average lifespan in the Community had increased, to the point where this term was no longer sufficient to cover two generations (recital 5). Therefore, in order to establish a high level of protection, which at the same time meets the requirements of the internal market and the need to establish a legal environment conducive to the harmonious development of literary and artistic creation in the Community (recital 11), the Directive harmonised the term of protection for copyright at 70 years after the death of the author.
Therefore, apart from harmonisation, the main reason for the extension of the term of protection from 50 to 70 years was the extension of the average lifespan in Europe. We do not see any reason linked to the digital environment that would question this extension. 

III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

                                       
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States? 

NO - Please explain
There is no problem with the fact that most exceptions provided in EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States. The list of exceptions of the 2001/29/EC Directive is very long and encompasses all possible exceptions in the EU, but not for direct implementation by all Member States. Making this list mandatory would severely undermine the protection of authors' rights. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions? 

NO - Please explain
There is no general need for a higher level of harmonisation of the closed-list of exceptions and limitations of the Copyright Directive. As stated in recital 31, the degree of harmonisation of exceptions and limitations should be based on their impact on the smooth functioning of the internal market (last sentence). Neither the Commission nor the De Wolf study on the application of the Copyright Directive demonstrated such an impact in respect of any of the exceptions studied. 
The only exception with a potential impact on the smooth functioning of the internal market is the private copying exception which is accompanied by fair compensation systems. We therefore propose that the private copying exception and its fair compensation system be further harmonised (see answer to Q. 64 and subsequent on private copying).

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases. 
[Open question]
Directors UK does not see any need for any additional exceptions to the long list of exceptions in the 2001 Copyright Directive.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

NO - Please explain 
The exceptions and limitations in the closed-list of the Copyright Directive provides for a sufficient degree of flexibility. Further flexibility in this area would lead to more ambiguity and less certainty with respect to the scope of permitted acts.

Directors UK opposes the introduction of a "fair use" provision in the EU since it is not adapted to EU law and provides no legal certainty as issues can only be resolved in front of the courts. We note that the study by De Wolf & Partners on the application of the Copyright Directive (p. 403) does not support introducing a general provision of fair use in EU copyright law. 

The May 2011 Hargreaves report in the UK supports our view. It stated on page 5 that "The Review considered whether the more comprehensive American approach to copyright exceptions, based upon the so called Fair Use defence, would be beneficial in the UK. We concluded that importing Fair Use wholesale was unlikely to be legally feasible in Europe and that the UK could achieve many of its benefits by taking up copyright exceptions already permitted under EU law (...)". The Review also pointed out on page 44 that "Most responses to the Review from established UK businesses were implacably hostile to adoption of a US Fair Use defence in the UK on the grounds that it would bring: massive legal uncertainty because of its roots in American case law; an American style proliferation of high cost litigation; and a further round of confusion for suppliers and purchasers of copyright goods.".


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?

NO - Please explain
The territoriality of exceptions and limitations matches the territoriality principle of copyright and allows for respect of Member States' legal and cultural specificities. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of "fair compensation" be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

It seems reasonable that fair compensation be due in the place where the end user benefits from the exception, as is the case, for example, with the private copying exception (levies are due in the country in which the `harm' to the rightholder arises, i.e. in the country in which the end user who bought the product resides according to the Opus ruling of the CJUE). In addition, it is crucial that remuneration be provided to the rightholders in the country where they reside, which is possible thanks to reciprocal agreements between collective management organisations.


* Access to content in libraries and archives

* Preservation and archiving

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28. (b) Have you experienced problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?

NO 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
As far as film heritage institutions are concerned, the 2001 Copyright Directive provides for carefully crafted exceptions addressing the needs of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments, museums and archives:
* In respect of specific acts of reproduction of works in their collections which are not for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage (Art 5.2(c)), not limited to preservation purposes as such;
* For communication or making available, for the purpose of research or private study, to individual members of the public by dedicated terminals on the premises of their establishments of works not subject to purchase or licensing terms which are contained in their collections (Art 5.3(n)).
These exceptions allow film archive institutions to fulfil their public interest missions. 
Above these exceptions, we know that many SAA members have offered their help to film and audiovisual archives institutions on many occasions to address their needs in relation to the use of the cinematographic and audiovisual works contained in their collections and their related authors' rights. This has resulted in specific arrangements in a number of countries: collective agreements with INA in France, mandatory collective administration of broadcasters' archives in Switzerland, extended collective agreements in the Netherlands and in the Nordic countries, etc.

In addition, the SAA was a signatory of the Statement of Principles and Procedures for facilitating the digitisation of, access to and increased interest of European citizens in European cinematographic heritage works which was developed in the framework of working group 3 of the Licences for Europe stakeholder dialogue. The Statement aims to facilitate discussions among the parties concerned on the relevant terms for digitisation and access to European cinematographic heritage works conserved in European film heritage institutions. 
The signatories "share the view that European cinematographic heritage works constitute unique cultural elements as well as valuable assets in the European digital economy, and therefore, 1) they pledge to strengthen their mutual collaboration and that with the European Commission and Member States relating to European cinematographic heritage works ; and 2) at the same time, conscious of the investments necessary fully to seize the opportunities offered by digital technologies, they call on the Member States and the EU institutions to introduce financial mechanisms to support projects launched under this Statement to digitise European cinematographic heritage works  and to promote their  accessibility and increased discoverability by European citizens."
Directors UK was the SAA representative organisation on this workgroup and we played a leading role in the discussions and in the final document.
The Commission should work as a facilitator to encourage film archive institutions and their European representatives to explore the possibility of further agreements with audiovisual authors' organisations whether at national or EU level. 

2. Off-premises access to library collections

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32. (c) Have you negotiated agreements with institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private study? 
[Open question]
In our view, online remote access is to be dealt with by way of licensing via collective management organisations. In fact, this is already the case in the UK and several other Member States to promote education. 

Directors UK is a member of the ERA educational licensing scheme in the UK.  This enables broadcasts to be used for educational purposes. Serving the UK education sector, ERA (Educational Recording Agency) is one of a range of CMOs which help copyright owners and performers derive an income from the licensed use of their works. In practice, it means that "recordings made or sourced under the terms of an ERA Licence can be built into a resource bank for an educational establishment covering topics such as drama, wildlife, the arts and current affairs. Copies of licensed recordings can be made for educational use within licensed premises. Clips from programmes can also be selected and used to encourage reference to the resource library, or for cross reference within class presentations or lectures. Increasingly, online relay within licensed premises linked to a white board and other in-class presentations is widening the number of ways that licensed recordings can be used." 

In addition, educational establishments, or bodies acting on behalf of educational establishments which hold ERA Licences, are eligible to take out "ERA Plus Licences", an additional licence which allows "access to the recordings by students and teachers online, whether they are on the premises of their school, college or university, or at home or working elsewhere within the UK". 


3. E-lending

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
39. What difference do you see between libraries' traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
Because of the nature of the internet, the difference between libraries' traditional activities and online consultation and e-lending is huge. The conditions for these new activities have to be discussed with authors' representative organisations like CMOs through licensing processes which will allow libraries to develop these new activities and for authors to be remunerated.  We would always be willing to co-operate in such discussions.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters' archives)?
YES  -  Please explain
Directors UK is a strong supporter of the project that was started in WG3 (Audiovisual and Film Heritage Institutions) of Licences for Europe and find a way to undertake mass digitization and clearance for online uses of the high volume of older works in the archives of film heritage institutions and public services broadcasters. Audiovisual authors' CMOs have a central role to play in helping these institutions preserve and offer to the public the cultural heritage of great works.
Thanks to the Statement of Principles and Procedures for heritage films online concluded between ACE, FERA, FIAPF and the SAA during Licences for Europe, film heritage institutions and rightholders' representatives now have a clear roadmap to discuss and agree terms for digitizing, restoring and making available European film heritage. It will enable film heritage institutions to free up European films stored in their archives while guaranteeing rightholders an appropriate share of the rewards.
As far as broadcasters' archives are concerned, no broad agreement including all stakeholders could be reached during the Licences for Europe timeframe. EBU and the SAA together developed some recommendations highlighting that collective licensing solutions are particularly suitable for the large scale clearance of rights. This would help make a very significant amount of works available, particularly for research and educational purposes. We are aware that in the UK there is strong support for this idea from the BBC.  The BBC has recently estimated that it holds more than 570,000 TV Programmes, more than 2.6 million items of film, and video including more than 900,000 News items in its archive that contain particular contributions that may not be cleared because of the contractual circumstances concerned.  There is a clear need for proportionate, cost effective rights clearance mechanisms for such large archives

Further discussions are needed to develop an MoU or any other type of general agreement that would propose a suitable solution for mass digitization and rights clearance of broadcasters' archives based on collective management.

B. Teaching


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they? 

Please see our response to question 32 (c) above in relation to the ERA scheme in the UK.


F. User-generated content 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
58. (c) Have you experienced problems resulting from the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?
YES - Please explain
The De Wolf and CRIDS study on the application of the 2001/29/EC Directive acknowledges that a major part of user-generated content (UGC) which may be found on the internet requires in principle a prior licence from the rightholders whose works are used. 
Whether amateur or professional, creative works are subject to the same copyright rules. Meaning that the use of existing protected works needs to be authorised by the rightholder, unless an exception can be invoked.
The Commission document for this consultation highlights that social media platforms have vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic impact for rightholders in the pre-existing works. If this is the case, why is there so little case-law on this issue as discovered by De Wolf and CRIDS in their study?
Authors do not oppose UGC in principle. They are very familiar with creative processes which use pre-existing works, in particular in the audiovisual sector where films very often use recorded music and documentaries are sometimes made of extracts of older works. The process is therefore not new, particularly for professional authors, and authorisation guarantees respect for moral rights. 
What is striking with UGC is the claim of some users to create UGC content without seeking the permission of the authors of the pre-existing works, but to ask for recognition of their rights on the new works. This is unacceptable, as is the way in which Q.59 below is phrased  -  it recognises the rights of the creator of the new work but fails to acknowledge the rights of the original rightholder, i.e. the owner of the pre-existing work(s) on the basis of which the new work was created! 
The essence of this activity renders any court proceedings ineffective: rightholders would probably win the case from a legal perspective but the costs of the proceedings largely outweigh the possible financial benefit. 
It is a pity that WG2 of Licences for Europe was unable to deliver on this issue, due to the opposition of users' groups to any licensing solutions as they favour the introduction of a new exception to authors' rights.
In our view, the solution to user-generated content lies in licensing schemes concluded between rightholders' representatives such as audiovisual authors' CMOs and the social media platforms as well as micro-licences for small users, unless an exception is applicable. In fact, many examples of licensing schemes are already being developed (e.g. in the music sector according to GESAC's statement and IFPI's announcement) and should be encouraged and promoted.  We accept that licensing for UGC of audio-visual content  -  especially clips  -  could be far more complex than licences for a single musical work because of the larger numbers of rights that might be included within a clip.  However, our view is that this makes the achievement of a simple and fair collective licence solution to this problem all the more appropriate, and we would be prepared to continue to support efforts by the Commission and others to find an acceptable solution to this problem that meets the needs of users and consumers as well as the underlying rightholders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
As previously said in our answer to Q.58, the use of pre-existing protected works to create user-generated content needs the authorisation of the authors or their representatives (in particular, to guarantee respect for moral rights), unless an exception can be invoked.
The De Wolf and CRIDS study on the application of the 2001/29/EC Directive pointed out that "a UGC exception remains a premature option" and there does not seem to be a need to act for the moment. We support this view and consider that there is no need for a new exception being introduced for UGC. However, the study notes that a Commission Communication on UGC to clarify what uses are allowed and give an opinion on what exceptions are relevant may be useful. We are ready to consider such a communication.
Anything falling outside existing exceptions should be dealt with via simple licensing solutions. These licensing mechanisms should be devised to ensure that very personal uses would cost virtually nothing in terms of licensing fees and the cost of licenses generally would be proportionate to the use made of the works. It is noteworthy that internet platforms should not be the main beneficiaries of the success of UGC, so licenses with the platforms rather than only with the individuals themselves should also be sought. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
63. If your view is that a different solution (non-legislative) is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
As previously mentioned in our answer to Q.61, anything falling outside the existing exceptions should be dealt with via simple licensing solutions. 

IV. Private copying and reprography

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?

YES - Please explain
Focusing on the private copying exception, we endorse SAA's contributions to the Vitorino report and to the European Parliament report drafted by Mrs. Castex MEP on private copying levies aimed at highlighting and ensuring that the following principles are recognised and enforced:
* Private copying is justly accompanied by compensation for the rightholders.
* Having levies on devices and media making private copies is an efficient and cost-effective way to organise the compensation.
* An important element of the system's cost-effectiveness is to collect the levies at the earliest stages of the sales chain, i.e. from the manufacturer or the importer. 
* The amount of private copying compensation should be linked to the value of the creative works being copied, not to the price of the devices which can depend on commercial strategies.
* The private copying system should be brought into the digital age and reflect the fact that consumers make private copies more than ever before on ever more connected devices and services.  
* There is a need for common principles for defining applicable levy rates and devices/services that should be subject to levies. 
It is of particular concern that the UK government proposed a private copying exception without any accompanying fair compensation mechanism  -  in clear breach of Art 5 of the Copyright Directive. This situation combined with the Spanish one, where the government eliminated levies and transferred to the state budget the fair compensation obligation but with only a very reduced amount, reinforces the need for harmonisation of the private copying exception and its fair compensation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?

YES - Please explain
In its contributions to the European Parliament `Castex report', the SAA explained that Mr. Vitorino's recommendation (licensed copies do not cause harm) suggests that all subsequent copies made of a work following purchase from digital services can be covered by licenses granted by rightholders to these services.  Mr Vitorino therefore proposed to eliminate levies for "new business models in the digital environment". 
This is based on a gross misconception of both the private copying system and the multitude of new digital services which provide access to protected works. Private copies cannot be licensed since they are covered by a statutory exception to copyright under the 2001/29 Copyright Directive. Therefore licensing and fair compensation for private copying can only be separate issues.
Moreover, if the private copying exception was questioned and private copies inserted into licences, the ones that would suffer most from such a change would be consumers and authors, the consumers losing their freedom to copy and the authors their fair compensation.
* In practice, the authorisation, licence fee and commercial terms are negotiated by the holders of exclusive rights with each digital service during the licensing process, whereas fair compensation is collected through the levy system and distributed to rightholders by CMOs. 
* Mr. Vitorino's proposal derives from the flawed idea that digital services would allow rightholders to be compensated directly. In practice, only few rightholders or categories of rightholders grant licences to digital services (the producers or further intermediaries). Other rightholders, such as audiovisual authors who transferred their exclusive rights to the producer sometimes for a lump-sum payment, do not have any direct relation with digital services and therefore, no possibility to be paid directly. 
* In this field, a huge advantage of the private copying system is that it corrects inequalities between rightholders and guarantees that each category of rightholders benefits from a fair share of the value.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders' revenue on the other? 

We agree with SAA that the application of levies to certain online services is justified and we do not think that it would hinder the development and functioning of new business models. One of the reasons being that, just like the prices of products across Europe do not vary in proportion to the levy rates, the prices of online services/new business models are most probably also unaffected by the levy rates. 
More copying for private use takes place now than ever before. The devices and media which enable or host private copies of protected works have increased, with storage capacities which have grown exponentially (iPad of 128 Go, external hard disks of 5To, etc.).
Consumers transfer songs and videos from computers to hard drives to phones to tablets to online lockers and back again in order to save and access their personal libraries whenever and wherever they want. All of these processes are undeniably acts of private copying. 
In addition, in line with the principle of technical neutrality, copies made via cloud services (and other future digital services which do not yet exist) many have the same purpose (private use) as the copies made by private individuals on their phones, tablets, etc. so should be included in the private copying system. 
Applying private copying to certain cloud-based services means that copies made on those specific cloud-based services would be taken into account by usage studies which assess the harm caused.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies?

YES - Please explain
Past and recent consultation processes on private copying levies have shown that stakeholders agree that levies should be clearly visible on all bills and contracts in the products' sales chain.
In addition, consumers should be informed of the amount and destination of the levies and more generally the reason for this mechanism which compensates the freedom to copy they have thanks to the private copying exception. This would help consumers understand how important the levy system is for the EU's culture and rightholders and that they are part of and benefit from this virtuous system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services? 

NO - Please explain

If the system of private copying levies is harmonised as we have proposed, there would be no issue of undue levy payments. The rule would be that the levy is due in the Member State in which the final user who purchased the product resides since that is where the `harm' to the rightholder would arise (CJEU Opus ruling). In any case, even if undue levy payments occasionally did occur, exemptions and reimbursement systems should be in place to ensure that such equipment does not bear levies.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.). 
[Open question]
Devices and blank media can serve other purposes than for the private copying of protected works. This should be taken into account when determining tariffs applicable to devices used to make private copies.  
In addition, there are cases where certain devices and media will clearly not be used for the purpose of private copying, such as `professional uses'. In this context, exemptions and reimbursement systems should be in place to ensure that the equipment concerned does not bear levies. However, exempting any business from private copying levies would be excessive since equipment bought by companies can also generate private copies. The determining factor is the nature of the use, not the quality of the purchaser.
* As recommended by the CJEU in the "Padawan" ruling (C-467/08), professional uses should be excluded from payment of the levy, but not necessarily all purchases of professional users. Devices such as tablets or smartphones, despite being the property of a company, may well in fact be used by employees to copy protected works for private use. Recommending that private copying levies should apply exclusively to purchases by natural persons as private users would artificially reduce the scope of the private copying system. 
* Exemption and refund systems for professional uses should be designed at national level in consideration of the specificities of the Member States concerned. 
* The "Austro-Mechana" CJEU ruling (C-521/11) confirmed that reimbursement schemes for the levies paid on devices that are not ultimately used for private purposes comply with EU law, as long as they are effectively applied and do not constitute an excessive burden for those who are entitled to reimbursement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
70. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help to remedy the situation? 

Please see our response to Q.68 above. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?

Firstly, the rightholders' proposal to introduce a single declaration point would facilitate declaration and payment procedures by manufacturers/importers. Indeed, the proposal to create a single European declaration was put forward by European rightholders during the 2008-2009 dialogue, and agreed with the ICT industry. It aims to facilitate the implementation of the "Opus" ruling of the CJEU (C-462/09). Via the "European Central Point" mechanism, distance sellers could submit declarations of sales of goods eligible to private copying levies at a single EU entry point, while the compensation would be invoiced and paid in the country of destination.
Secondly, the most efficient and cost-effective way to collect levies is to do so at the earliest stage of the sales chain, i.e. the manufacture or import stage. Shifting the liability to pay levies onto retailers, as proposed by Mr. Vitorino, would render the system extremely complex and costly since this would considerably increase the number of those responsible for paying the levies and the means needed to ensure billing and control systems.
The prime responsibility of manufacturers and importers for payment of the levies must go hand in hand with joint liability of all entities throughout the chain of sales down to the final consumer in order to avoid potential fraud and unfair competition. This principle was also agreed between representatives of rightholders and the ICT industry during the 2008-2009 dialogue.
Thirdly, the fact that leviable devices and blank media differ across Member States means that the same product can be subject to private copying levies in a Member State and not in another. Compensation systems should be in place for all devices and media whose value is increased by multimedia storage and playback features. Therefore, a consistent definition of devices and media subject to private copying levies in the respective Member States should be sought. The SAA and other rightholders' organisations proposed during the 2008-2009 dialogue that all products (devices and media) able to be used to make private copies of protected works should be eligible for the private copying compensation scheme, with a list of products established and regularly updated at EU level. 
However, the interruption of the dialogue by the ICT industry in 2010 did not end in any concrete result and the Vitorino report was a missed opportunity as, despite suggesting a degree of harmonisation (such as regarding the definition of harm), Mr. Vitorino recommended Member State flexibility in the choice of devices subject to levies. 
Fourthly, European rightholders organisations agree that a quick and harmonised levy setting procedure should be developed across Europe. This would mean putting in place a European framework of definitions, principles and procedures to be respected by all Member States in the establishment of their levy setting process.

V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
72. What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?

Fair remuneration of authors is a very important issue related in particular to the online distribution of audiovisual works, and we would concur with the summary of views contained in SAA's White Paper on Audiovisual Authors' Rights and Remuneration published in February 2011.
For audiovisual authors, a `best mechanism' to ensure that they receive adequate remuneration for the exploitation of their works should relate to the use made of the authors' works and should in particular reward the success of works.  Such a mechanism incentivises authors to maintain their careers in Europe, and joins them with producers in seeking to maximise the enjoyment by audiences of their works.  Buy-out contracts do not provide such incentives, and have the effect of focussing the attention of authors on the production of their next work as the main means of earning income, and away from the success of their current works and the value of those works to audiences.
Contractual practices in the vast majority of European countries deprive audiovisual authors of their rights and prevent them from receiving fair remuneration, in particular for the online distribution of their works (please see our answer to Q.73 on unfair contracts below). Audiovisual authors in most countries are forced, because of their weak bargaining position and the absence of legislation to protect them, to assign all their rights and receive a one-off fee at the production stage with no further payments linked to the exploitation of the work, except for collectively managed rights such as cable retransmission and private copying.  British TV directors do have the benefit of a collective licence negotiated by Directors UK with the leading UK producers and broadcasters which provides a royalty payment that relates to the overall value of exploitation of TV programmes.  British film directors do not have such a protection and are in a similar position to their colleagues in the rest of Europe.
Further payments linked to the exploitation of the work (which can continue for years) are essential to enable authors to make a living in-between projects. The characteristic of this profession is that it can take years to prepare a film and enter into production.  Almost all authors are freelance i.e. not in full-time employment with a production company.  Time they spend thinking of new ideas and researching and developing projects is rarely if ever remunerated separately.
Directors UK therefore supports SAA's proposal to combat these unfair contractual practices and to develop a sustainable remuneration system which would secure audiovisual authors' remuneration for their making available right in the digital market, taking advantage of the new technologies.
Such a proposal for European legislation builds on the harmonisation experience in the EU:
* the 1992 Rental Right Directive which provides for an unwaivable remuneration right for the rental.
* the 1993 Cable and Satellite Directive which provides for mandatory collective administration of the cable retransmission right 
SAA's proposal takes the best from both of these: it provides that when an audiovisual author has transferred his making available right to a producer, he retains the right to obtain equitable remuneration for the making available which cannot be waived, unlike the rental right. It also addresses the implementation aspects in order to ensure that the proposal will result in concrete payments to authors.
Two implementation aspects are extremely important and were lacking in the 1992 Rental Right Directive: who should pay for the equitable remuneration and how should it be administered. Having learned from this experience, SAA's proposal addresses these two aspects: 
* The equitable remuneration should be paid by audiovisual media services that make audiovisual works available to the public on-demand;
* Its administration should be entrusted to responsible and accountable collective management organisations representing audiovisual authors, unless other audiovisual authors' organisations, such as unions or guilds, are in a better position to guarantee such remuneration in a specific country. 
This European legislation is a necessity as contractual practices are unable to guarantee such remuneration to audiovisual authors for the making available of their works. European producers, which are mainly small companies, are very much focused on the production stage and little involved in the subsequent exploitation. They have therefore not developed industrial processes and mechanisms to trace and administer payments due to authors for the distribution of their works on multiple platforms and most of them would prefer not to do it at all since it would be costly. The only entities to do this are authors' collective management organisations. They are today ready to invest further in order to address the remuneration due to audiovisual authors for the online distribution of their works.
It does however have to be clarified that SAA's proposal does not interfere with the producer's role. It aims at organising the remuneration due to authors, once the producer has decided to make the work available to the public in such a manner and at the time he chooses. It therefore means that any on-demand exploitation of an audiovisual work will continue to have to be cleared with the producer or with the making available right holder appointed by the producer or subsequent contractor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)? 

YES - Please explain
We support an intervention by the Commission into contractual practices. Indeed, we support fairer contractual terms and practices, whilst acknowledging that this will not solve all the problems, in particular the remuneration issue of audiovisual authors for the exploitation of their works. Any initiative in this field should therefore complement the introduction into EU legislation of an unwaivable right to remuneration of audiovisual authors for their making available right, based on the revenues generated from the online distribution of their works and collected by collective management organisations from final distributors (as explained in our answer to Q.72 above).
Our position is clearly supported by the European Parliament who stated its view twice in recent years:
* In the excellent report on the challenges facing the distribution of European cinema in the digital era prepared by Mr Borys, a Polish MEP (European cinema in the Digital Era), the European Parliament stated in November 2011 that there is a need to: "...accompany the development of new online exploitation methods with the implementation, at European level, of fair remuneration for audiovisual authors that is proportional to the revenues generated by these new formats and services".
* In the report by Mr Cavada, a French MEP on the online distribution of audiovisual works in September 2012, the European Parliament: 
  + "Maintains that it is essential to guarantee authors and performers remuneration that is fair and proportional to all forms of exploitation of their works, especially online exploitation, and therefore calls upon the Member States to ban buy-out contracts, which contradict this principle;"
  + "Calls for the bargaining position of authors and performers vis-à-vis producers to be rebalanced by providing authors and performers with an unwaivable right to remuneration for all forms of exploitation of their works, including ongoing remuneration where they have transferred their exclusive `making available' right to a producer;"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

In most European countries, audiovisual authors suffer from unfair contractual terms (excessive transfers of rights in terms of scope and duration, transfer of rights to remuneration, etc.) imposed by producers or broadcasters in the individual negotiation of their contract. These negotiations too often result in buy-out contracts, authors receiving a lump sum payment for the writing and/or directing of the film, with no further payment no matter how commercially successful the film goes on to be. Even when authors sign contracts which respect their economic interests and provide for additional remuneration, they rarely receive any payment automatically, except when collective rules are in place and enforced in particular by collective rights management organisations.
In parallel to European initiatives to ensure proper remuneration of authors, consideration should be given to developing key standards for fair and enforceable contractual terms in individual contracts, including the prohibition of certain clauses in contracts.
Here are a number of concrete examples of unfair contract terms and practices from the UK:
* Especially in film contracts, deferral of fees.  Fees are usually deferred to a point where a film earns back sufficient revenue or profits. It is quite common that films fail to earn back enough to trigger the reimbursement of the deferral so these clauses are effectively agreements to waive pay. Our own research carried out shows the extent of this practice in the UK. The key conclusions were that: 
    o 70% of directors experience some form of fee deferral 
    o 20% experienced fee reductions after the closure of the original deal
    o 13.3% experienced changes in potential bonuses after closure
    o Of those experiencing deferral, 50% deferred 50% or more of fees, with 40% deferring 80-100% of fees
* Where contracts do contain an entitlement to bonuses or rewards for success, these are most often expressed as percentages of net profits or of producer profits. In practice, because of the fact that producers may themselves have had to trade away their own entitlement to profits and revenue shares, dubious accounting practices and breaks in the distribution chain (see below) it is very rare that any returns from such clauses ever materialise.
* It is common for film rights (and sometimes TV rights) to be traded and re-traded from one intermediary/aggregator/distributor to another, either on a territory or media basis. Contracts may still hold the original producer liable to pay further rewards to a director, but this can be frustrated if there is a break in the chain of intermediaries for whatever reason (e.g. bankruptcy, failure to report a transfer of rights) and if the original production company itself goes into liquidation  -  this is common when a special purpose vehicle company is set up to make a film and then dissolved once it is completed.
In addition, one way of ensuring the enforceability of fair contractual terms would be that producers applying for public funds for the production of films and audiovisual works should be obliged to provide a copy of authors' contracts among the documentation. The body providing for the financial support would have the obligation to check it and verify that it does not contain unfair terms such as those examples described above. This would be a strong incentive for producers to better respect authors' rights as it would become a pre-condition for obtaining public financial support. 
The SAA White Paper on Audiovisual Authors' Rights and Remuneration in Europe carried out a survey of the situation of audiovisual authors in the different EU countries and highlighted the important differences in legal traditions, audiovisual market sizes, etc. It did not judge the harmonisation of contractual practices to be an adequate option to ensure equal remuneration conditions to authors throughout Europe. SAA therefore developed a specific proposal to achieve this objective: the unwaivable right to remuneration of audiovisual authors for their making available right with compulsory collective management. 
This would ensure that, whatever the contract signed with the producer, online services would have to negotiate with authors' organisations and would guarantee remuneration for each exploitation of a work, without relying on the long contractual chain that today deprives most authors of their remuneration for the exploitation of their works.


V. Respect for rights

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

NO - Please explain
The scope of the question and clarifications of the civil enforcement system in the EU should not be limited to infringements committed `with a commercial purpose'. All infringements should be punished. The only difference being that sanctions will be larger for commercial purpose infringements.
We agree with SAA that clarifications of the 2004/48/EC IPRs Enforcement Directive are necessary to avoid ambiguities and adapt the Directive to the challenges posed in particular by today's digital environment.  There are indeed a number of useful improvements and gaps in protection which should be considered.
In this context, we do not support any form of legislation that would decriminalise so-called non-commercial infringements. Given the nature of enforcement online, such decriminalisation would provide a readymade defence for structurally-infringing websites.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The SAA welcomes recent national court decisions, for example in France, which are clarifying the role of intermediaries in the IP enforcement infrastructure. They are increasingly required to carry out an active role and take on responsibilities. 
We are also aware of continuing problems in some parts of Europe -  Spain and Scandinavia for example  -  and even in the UK there are a number of enforcement provisions in the Digital Economy Act that have yet to be fully implemented.  

We encourage the Commission to examine the possibility of integrating a `notice and takedown' type mechanism in the future revised Enforcement Directive. In addition the notification procedure (and the information to be provided) as well as the impact of this procedure, i.e. the action to be taken by the hosting provider (immediate take down (as quickly as possible within 24 hours) and stay down of illegal content, not just the links to it) should be harmonised.  
In addition, cooperation between rightholders and intermediaries could also lead to the development of useful filtering technologies which could be developed by platforms and implemented at the stage when users upload content onto their servers. This filtering technology would be based on databases of works which have been registered, with a view to identifying and blocking illegal content. In this context, cooperation between rights holders and providers is key to developing such databases of protected content and should therefore be encouraged.


VII. A single EU copyright title

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement? 
NO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
[Open question]
We do not see the need for "an optional unitary EU Copyright Title". This proposal to use Article 118 TFEU in the field of copyright was first made by the Commission in 2009 and then repeated in several documents but the Commission never explained the need for and the use of such a title. The only information delivered in the Green Paper was that "authors or producers of audiovisual works would have the option to register their works and then obtain a single title that would be valid throughout the EU". This (overly) brief presentation raises two questions: the registration condition and the nature of the title.
In terms of copyright protection, the Berne Convention prohibits any formality such as registration as a condition for the enjoyment and exercise of rights. Authors are very much attached to this prohibition which guarantees their rights in all circumstances as far as their creation is original and therefore deserves protection. Consequently, authors are very reluctant to see any system based on registration as it endangers their authorship of works. 
From a practical point of view, to pursue such a proposal, the Commission should then either undertake to revise the Berne convention or to define the nature of the title out of the copyright sphere.
Because of the formality prohibition, such titles do not exist in the copyright sphere. The only existing registries in the audiovisual sector have limited scope and impact which do not affect rights' protection and exercise (for example the necessary work declaration to an authors' society for an author to receive related payments, or the French cinema public registry which offers the statutory publication of certain contracts).
Article 118 TFUE has obviously been introduced for industrial property purposes and refers to the setting-up of centralised EU-wide authorisation, coordination and supervision arrangements, which do not seem relevant to authors' rights. 

VIII. Other issues

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.

More generally, it is crucial that creators be placed at the centre of EU copyright policy. After years of distrust and attacks against copyright by users' and consumers' groups who want to undermine a system that they do not consider fit for the digital age, there is an essential need to give back legitimacy to a system that promotes creativity, freedom of expression and dissemination of culture for the enjoyment and enrichment of the lives of citizens throughout Europe.
The best way to provide legitimacy to the copyright system is to reconnect it to creators and ensure that creators are the first and main beneficiaries of the licence fees and remuneration paid by users.
The current European copyright law does not provide for such a guarantee, except in limited cases (unwaivable right to equitable remuneration for the rental right) and gives rise to criticisms that it only works to the benefit of major entertainment companies.
There is therefore a need to rebalance European copyright policy in favour of authors and other creators as original rightholders. This needs to be the focus and priority of any forthcoming copyright reform.
This is a win-win solution for users and for all rightholders as it would clarify that creators are the main beneficiaries of the copyright system and therefore strengthen its legitimacy and its enforcement, in particular online.
The digital age has presented CMOs with a set of major challenges to many aspects of their operations. The analogue world has been replaced by one characterised by mass uses and transactions of copyright works, lower values of licences for transactions and much greater flexibility in the type of uses being made and the devices on which uses take place.  CMOs have adapted to this  -  and continue to do so  -  by doing the following:

* Investing in new technology, software and systems to keep their licensing operations fit for purpose
* Improving their governance, transparency and accountability to members and users
* Simplifying their licensing procedures to reduce transaction costs
* Innovating in the kind of licences being offered
* Making it a central objective to see the works of members receive the greatest possible legitimate distribution
* Promoting the use of copyright works for education and cultural purposes
* Making it a priority to engage young people directly whether they are users or creators of copyright works  -  and sometimes both at the same time  -  so that they learn respect for the value of creativity and are encouraged to express themselves creatively

We feel that the tone of the debate over copyright has so far been far too confrontational.  Our desire is to see a much healthier relationship develop between creators and the audiences for their works. Accordingly, we approved of the collaborative approach adopted by the Commission during the Licences for Europe stakeholders' dialogue and we were disappointed that many groups failed to step forward in that spirit. We would urge them to come back to this notion of collaboration.
