   S Publisher /Producer/Broadcaster

   I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the
one in which you live?

S NO
2. [In particular if you are a service prouder:] Have you faced problems
when seeking to proude online services across borders in the EU?


S NO
3.    [In particular if you are a right holder or a  collective  management
organisation:] How often are you
asked to grant multi-territońal licences? Please indicate, ifpossible,  the
number of requests per year  and  proude  examples  indicating  the  Member
State, the sector and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
We contend that issues surrounding the  territoriality  of  rights  do  not
affect  the  scholarly  publishing  sector,  where  the  granting  of   and
exploitation of rights operates differently to  other  content  industries.
When an author who owns copyright assigns copyright or grants a licence  to
publish directly to us for commercial exploitation of their work,  this  is
typically done on a worldwide exclusive basis.
Therefore, we believe that no further measures are needed at  EU  level  to
increase the crossborder availability of book or  journal  content  in  the
Single Market, in either print or digital formats.

4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any  of  the  questions
above — what would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
We contend that market-based solutions offered by rights holders  or  their
agents on a voluntary, non-exclusive, opt-in, and market-driven basis  work
very well under the current legal regime.
5. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all  the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still  find
it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on  a  service
provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain  content
is not possible in certain European countries)?

S NO
We believe access to our  content  across  Europe  is  facilitated  by  our
current  licences  and  delivery  systems  based  on  compliance  with  the
contracts and inherent terms & conditions we negotiate with our customers.
6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service  prouder:]  Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the  necessary
rights for  all  the  territories  in  question,  you  would  stillfind  it
necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions  on  the  service
recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to  a  different
website than the one he is trying to access)?

S NO
We believe access to our  content  across  Europe  is  facilitated  by  our
current  licences  and  delivery  systems  based  on  compliance  with  the
contracts and inherent terms & conditions we negotiate with our customers.


7. Do you think  that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) are needed at  EU  level  to  increase  the
cross-border availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while
ensuring an adequate level ofprotection for right holders?

S NO
We believe that no additional legislative or other measures are required as
we contend content is available across the European  Union  facilitated  by
our current licences and delivery  systems.  We  suggest  that  the  market
functioning is facilitated by appropriate enforcement of our rights,  which
in turn will be supported by raising awareness of copyright and  associated
rights amongst users:  a  copyright-compliant  environment  will  encourage
investment in developing services  and  so  increase  in  consumer  choice,
further growth and innovation.

B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to
be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
8. Is the scope of the "making available" right in  cross-border  situations
— i.e. when content is disseminated across borders — sufficiently clear?

S YES
We believe that the "scope" of the making available right  is  sufficiently
clear and that current copyright legislation provides an adequate means  of
enforcing copyright.
9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a  clanfication  of  the
temtońal scope of the "making  available"  right  have  an  effect  on  the
recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author
or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not),
on your remuneration, or  on  the  enforcement  of  rights  (including  the
availability of injunctive relief)?

S NO
We contend that clarification is not necessary.  We  provide  authors  with
sufficient  detail  regarding  their  status  and  rights  where  they  are
assigning or licensing us with publishing rights.

1. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
10. [In particular if you a service prouder or a  right  holder:]  Does  the
application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in  the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems foryou?

S no

2. LINKING AND BROWSING

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other  subject
matter protected under copyrights, either  in  general  or  under  specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rights holder?

S YES
We believe hyperlinks are  essential  components  of  online  content,  and
facilitate the process of  dissemination  and  discussion  of  content.  We
suggest a rights holder is entitled to set guidelines
on the form of the hyperlink to assure reliability  and  sustainability  of
links, e.g., all journal content is identified by industry-approved Digital
Object Identifiers (DOI).
We also set out rules  and  restrictions  on  access  for  example  in  our
journals content platform Terms & Conditions

12. Should the viewing of a  web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on
the screen and in the cache  memory  of  the  user's  computer,  either  in
general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of
the rights holder?

S NO
We suggest  that  reproductions  of  works  that  are  both  temporary  and
incidental to an authorized act should not require additional consent.

3. Download to own digital content
13. [In particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
restrictions when trying to resell digital files that  you  have  purchased
(e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

S NO
14. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  service  prouder:]  What
would be the consequences ofproviding a legal framework enabling the resale
ofpreviously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type  of
content) concerned.
[Open question]
We believe that permitting our digital  content  to  be  re-sold  under  an
exception would have a significant negative impact on our business.  Whilst
re-sale may  be  permissible  for  physical  printed  content,  which  bear
evidence of age and use, this is clearly not the case with digital content,
which  can  be  copied  and  shared  in  a  condition  as  perfect  and  as
indistinguishable from the original; therefore there is a  risk  that  such
content if re-sold would substitute for original content in the market.
This would also have the effect of limiting innovation as publishers  would
not be incentivized to invest in new digital media delivery services.

C. Registration of works and other subject matter — is it a good idea?

15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?

S NO

16 What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

[Not Applicable]


17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

[Not Applicable]

18. What incentives for registration by rights holders could be envisaged?

[Not Applicable]

D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

19. ^hat should be the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption  of
identifiers in the content sector, and in  promoting  the  development  and
interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
[Open question]
We believe there would be value in developing an EU "copyright hub", noting
the example and precedent of the UK Copyright Hub, a gateway to information
about copyright and guidance on obtaining  reuse  permission  licences  for
third party works

E. Term of protection — is it appropriate?

20. Are the current terms of copyńght protection still  appropriate  in  the
digital environment?

S YES

We find the current term of copyright protection to be satisfactory and
appropriate for rights holders' and consumers' needs.

  II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21. Are there problems arising from  the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for  the
Member States?

S NO
We believe that  negotiated  contracts  and  licensing  agreements  provide
clarity and consistency, and  so  eliminate  any  apparent  ambiguities  or
discrepancies in limitations and exceptions.
We do not foresee any problems with retaining optionality, as most  of  the
important exceptions to the benefit of  teaching,  research,  libraries  or
disabled persons are in  place  in  all  legislative  jurisdictions  across
Europe.

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be  made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

S NO


We suggest respect for local  and  national  markets  and  concomitant  law
should take  precedence  over  attempting  to  impose  European  Union-wide
mandate. Compromising the validity of negotiated contracts with individual,
local or national clients will curtail consumer choice and  interfere  with
cross-border trade.  We  contend  that  access  and  use  licenses  provide
balanced and equitable solutions, irrespective of the presence  or  absence
of exceptions in a particular part of the EU.

23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to  or  removed  from
the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to speafic cases.
[Open question]
We believe that the current system is well balanced and fit-for-purpose, as
consumers and rights holders continue to negotiate bespoke,  flexible,  and
efficient contractual agreements. Therefore we see no need  to  create  new
exceptions to the existing catalogue. We note  the  "Licences  for  Europe"
exercise, in which STM and its members actively  participated,  illustrates
the value of "structured stakeholder  dialogue"  in  identifying  need  and
licensing solutions which cater for new user demands.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to proude for  a
greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatoryframework for limitations
and exceptions?

S NO

We  believe  the  current  European  Union  regulatory  framework   to   be
sufficiently flexible.

25. If yes, what would be the  best  approach  to  proude  for  flexibility?
(e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic  reńsions  of
the directives, interpretations by the  Commission,  built-in  flexibility,
e.g. in the form of a fair-use orfair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)?
Please explain  indicating  what  would  be  the  relative  advantages  and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible  effects  on  the
functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]
We believe that the introduction of 'fair use' concepts would  be  entirely
inappropriate and impractical, given its complexity and reliance on ad  hoc
individual case precedents which have little or no  relevance  in  European
jurisdictions.

26 Does the terri'tori'ality of limitations and exceptions, in your
experience, constitute a problem? S NO


27. In the event that limitations and exceptions  established  at  national
level were to have cross-border effect, how should the  question  of  "fair
compensation"  be  addressed,  when  such  compensation  is  part  of   the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question] [Not Applicable]

A. Access to content in libraries and archives

28. (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
experienced specific problems when trying to use an exception  to  preserve
and archive specific works or other subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

S NO

29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

We find that digital archiving  and  preservation  have  been  successfully
achieved through stakeholder collaboration, making unilaterally  exceptions
redundant. Examples of this collaboration are market-based  solutions  such
as PORTICO  and  CLOCCKS  which  provide  highly  efficient  archiving  and
protection for scholarly content

30. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions  should
be covered and under which conditions?
[Open question]

Given our response to [29], we believe that no  "legislative  solution"  is
required.

31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]
Given our response to [29], we believe that no "different solution" is
required. 4. Off-premises access to library collections

32. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
experienced specific problems when  trying  to  negotiate  agreements  with
rights holders that enable you to proude remote  access,  including  across
borders, to your collections (or parts thereof forpurposes of research  and
private study?
b) [In particular if you are an end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of the
institutions in question?
c)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,  to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, forpurposes of  research  and  private
study?


[Open question]
We habitually negotiate issues of remote access for  authorised  users  for
private personal research purposes with our library clients.

33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
As noted above [32], by negotiation with a customer.

34. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions  should
be covered and under which conditions?
[Open question]

As noted above [32], our licensing solution militates against the need  for
any form of 'legislative solution'.

35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
As noted above [32], our licensing solution militates against the need  for
any form of 'different solution'.

5. E — lending

36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced  specific
problems when trying to  negotiate  agreements  to  enable  the  electronic
lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or other  materials
held in your collection?
b) [In particular if you are an end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books  or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending), including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?
c)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

S YES- 36c(Rights holder)
We habitually include provision for digital lending in our agreements  with
individual libraries, with library consortia (national, regional or local),
and with Collective Management Organizations.

37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
As noted above [36 c], by discussion and negotiation  with  a  customer  to
seek to address their specific needs

38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What  differences  do
you see in the management  ofphysical  and  online  collections,  including
providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?


[Open question]
We find that licensed digital lending is best managed within the terms  and
conditions of a negotiated licence.

39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do  you  see
between libraries' traditional activities such as on-premises  consultation
or public lending  and  activities  such  as  off-premises  (online,  at  a
distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
We have developed successful licensing solutions  that  address  such  user
activities  via  in  bespoke  licensing  agreements,  consortia   licensing
agreements, and national access licensing agreements.

6. Mass digitisation

40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting  to
engage  in  mass  digitisation  projects,  a  right  holder,  a  collective
management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your  country  to  enact
legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements
concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have  a  cross-border
effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

S NO
We do not believe that changing national law is necessary or even useful to
address crossborder access. We note the success of the 2011  Memorandum  of
Understanding  where  the  various  stakeholders  —  authors,   publishers,
libraries, and collective management organisations  —  worked  together  to
facilitate a mass-digitisation project, so making recourse  to  legislation
unnecessary.
41. Would it be  necessary  to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
agreed for  other  types  of  content  (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
collections, broadcasters' archives)?

S NO OPINION

B. Teaching

42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or  an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use  works  or
other  subject-matterfor  illustration  for  teaching,   including   across
borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced speafic
problems resultingfrom the way in which works or other  subject-matter  are
usedfor illustration for teaching, including across borders?

S YES
We believe exceptions should provide for exemption for works whose  primary
market is, in fact, teaching, so clarification would be helpful.

43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]


See our response to [42] above.

44. What mechanisms exist in the market  place  to  facilitate  the  use  of
content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
We are able to negotiate and authorize use of  various  content  types  for
teaching purposes within our licences with educational institutions.
45. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions  should
be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
We do not believe that a "legislative solution" is required,  and  in  fact
may limit new business models and consumer choice.

46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

Not Applicable

C. Research

47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or  an  institutional
user:] Haveyou experienced specific problems when trying to  use  works  or
other subject  matter  in  the  context  of  research  projects/activities,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Haveyou experienced  speafic
problems resultingfrom the way in which works or other  subject-matter  are
used in the  context  of  research  projects/activities,  including  across
borders?

S YES
We are committed to supporting scholarly research  collaboration,  mediated
by use and re-use licences which assure copyright is not infringed, and the
integrity  of  the  scientific  record  is  not  compromised,  via   Author
Publishing Agreements and sophisticated post-publication author services
48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
See our response to [47] above.

49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States  to  facilitate  the  use  of
contentfor research purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]

See our response to [47] above.


D. Disabilities

50. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
organisation representing persons with disabilities:] Have you  experienced
problems with accessibility to content, including across  borders,  arising
from Member States' implementation of this exception?
b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for  persons
with    disabilities:]    Have    you     experienced     problems     when
distributing/communicating works published in special  formats  across  the
EU?
c) [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Haveyou  experienced  spedfic
problems  resultingfrom  the  application  of  limitations  or   exceptions
allowing for the distribution/communication of works published  in  special
formats, including across borders?

S NO
We  agree  that  exceptions  and  limitations  in  favour  of  people  with
disabilities are  appropriate,  necessary,  and  justified  by  the  public
interest.

51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]
Taylor & Francis is a publishing partner with Bookshare.

52. What mechanisms exist in the marketplace to facilitate accessibility  to
content? How successful are they? [Open question]
See our response to [51] above.

E. Text and data mining

53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to copyrights, when trying to
use text or data mining methods, including across borders?
b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  service  prouder:]  Haveyou  experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services based  on  text  or
data mining methods, including across borders?
c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Haveyou  experienced  specific
problems resulting from the use of text and  data  mining  in  relation  to
copyright protected content, including across borders?
S NO

We are committed to support research and to facilitate and meet  bona  fide
non-commercial text and data mining requests, and  to  that  end  Taylor  &
Francis is a signatory of the STM Association "Declaration on Text  &  Data
Mining"


Taylor & Francis is also participating in CrossRef s  latest  collaborative
service, Prospect which aims to provide a  common,  standards-based  cross-
publisher API and licence registry.
54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]
We are  committed  to  working  with  the  research  community  to  develop
solutions that  enable  text  and  data  mining  which  does  not  infringe
copyright.
55. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which  activities  should  be  covered  and  under  what
conditions?
[Open question]

Given our responses [53] and [54], we do not find there is  a  need  for  a
"legislative solution".

56 If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Given our responses [53] and [54], we do not find there is  a  need  for  a
"different solution".

57. ^re  there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?
[Open question]
Yes, we suggest that technological and security issues are more significant
than copyright issues  with  respect  to  text  and  data  mining.  We  are
concerned that uncontrolled crawling of websites for  text  and  data  will
adversely   impact   security   and   compromise   technical   performance.
Uncontrolled access requests and crawling will cause server instability and
overload, which will jeopardise legitimate services  to  clients,  damaging
their user experience and our business model.

F. User-generated content

58. (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject
matter to  disseminate  new  content  on  the  Internet,  including  across
borders?
b) [In particular if you  are  a  service  prouder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?
c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced  problems
resulting from the way the users are  using  pre-existing  works  or  other
subject-matter to disseminate new content on the Internet, including across
borders?

S YES
We work with our authors to ensure the incorporation of extant  third-party
copyrighted works into new works is reasonable,  ethical,  and  legal;  our
Guidance is here


59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a  right  holder:]
Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you  have
created (on the  basis  ofpre-existing  works)  is  properly  identifiedfor
online use? Are proprietary systems suffiaent in this context?

(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  proude
possibilities for users that are publishing/disseminating  the  works  they
have created (on the basis ofpre-existing works) through  your  service  to
properly identify these works for online use?

S YES
Assuring the originality, provenance, and ownership of content is  critical
to our business. All submitting authors are required  to  comply  with  our
ethical guidelines, and to make legally-binding warranties with respect  to
their work.

We have also invested in online submission and  peer  review  systems  like
ScholarOne  and  Editorial  Manager  which  help   assure   integrity,   in
combination with originality software tools like CrossCheck

60. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right  holder):]
Have you experienced problems when trying to be remuneratedfor the  use  of
the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?

(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  prouder:]  Do  you   proude
remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?
S YES
Taylor & Francis manage third-party reuse permission requests in-house  and
via the RightsLink agency — detail here

61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question] Not Applicable

62. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which  activities  should  be  covered  and  under  what
conditions?

[Open question]

Given our response [60], we do not find there is a need for a  "legislative
solution".

63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

Given our response [60], we do not find there is a need  for  a  "different
solution".
 III. Private copying and reprography

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the  scope  and
application of the  private  copying  and  reprography  exceptions  in  the
digital environment?

S NO
We believe that further clarification of private copying is  not  required,
given the European Union Copyright Directive sets out basic  principles  to
be applied to private copying and reprography, and  concomitant  exceptions
and limitations.

65. Should digital copies made by end users  for  private  purposes  in  the
context of a service that has been licensed by rights  holders,  and  where
the harm to the rights holder is minimal, be  subject  to  private  copying
levies?

S YES
This question depends on the interpretation of "minimal harm";  unless  the
private copying activity in question complies with  an  agreement  we  have
with a given customer, then we would reserve the right to consider the case
under its own merit, and apply a fee where we consider that appropriate.

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application  to  online
services (e.g. services based on cloud computing  allowing,  for  instance,
users  to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the   development
andfunctioning of new business models on the one hand and  rights  holders'
revenue on the other?
[Open question]
We believe that internet-based services, email, or other services  such  as
social networks which can facilitate digital access  to  copyrighted  works
should not be covered by the  exception,  but  be  subject  to  appropriate
licensing, certainly for commercial re-use.

67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
for products subject to levies? S YES
68. Have you  experienced  a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or
other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

.S NO

69. What percentage ofproducts subject to a levy is sold  to  persons  other
than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying?  Do
any of those transactions result  in  undue  payments?  Please  explain  in
detail the example  you  proude  (type  ofproducts,  type  of  transaction,
stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]

See answer to question 67


70. Where such undue payments  arise,  what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
affect?  To  what  extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or   ex   post
reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy  the
situation?

  IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

72. [In particular if  you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to  ensure  that  you  receive  an
adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
We believe  that  market  and  competitive  forces  within  the  publishing
industry ensures fair remuneration for creators, as publishers compete with
each other for  publication  rights  from  authors,  editors,  and  learned
societies, who, if they find remuneration to be insufficient, will seek  an
alternative publishing  partner  with  better  terms  of  remuneration  and
reward.

73. Is there a need to act  at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?

S NO
No, we believe  our  Author,  Editor,  and  Society  Publishing  Agreements
constitute fair and equitable agreements between partners in the publishing
process. Any interference by the European Union  in  limiting  any  party's
ability to negotiate terms could be harmful to the prosperity  and  success
of all partners.
74. If you consider that the current rules are  not  effective,  what  would
you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

  V. Respect for rights

75. Should the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
efficient  for  infringement's  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commemal
purpose?

S YES
We are concerned that INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS (ISPS)s on  occasion  host
infringing content and do not take action to filter or remove such content.
We contend that ISPs must comply with copyright law,  and  promptly  remove
infringing content when requested to do

so by a rights holder. Copyright enforcement against infringements  carried
out for a commercial purpose must be made more efficient.

76 In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow  for
suffiaent  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such   as   Internet   service
providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  prońders,  domain  name
registrars, etc.) in  inhibiting  online  copyright  infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]
We suggest  that  some  ISPs  and  intermediaries  appear  to  have  little
incentive  to  coöperate  with  respect   to   allegations   of   copyright
infringements, and so we believe ISPs and intermediaries should be required
to take reasonable measures to prevent infringements.

77. Does the  current  avil  enforcementframework  ensure  that  the  right
balance is achieved between the right to have one's copyright respected and
other  rights  such  as  the  protection  ofprivate  life  and   protection
ofpersonal data?

S NO

   VI. A single EU Copyright Title

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU  Copyright  Title,
as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions
to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

S NO

79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the  EU?
Does the current level of difference among  the  Member  State  legislation
mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

VII. Other issues

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework
for copyright? Please explain and  indicate  how  such  matters  should  be
addressed.

[Open question]

We believe that international  coöperation  on  acting  against  infringing
piracy sites is critical to the sustainability of the publishing  industry,
and thus the European Union should support such coöperation.
