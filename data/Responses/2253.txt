     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).



9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of

to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,

5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the

the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
YES
Access to online educational and research material is mainly based on a multitude of
agreements with different provisions for each agreement and which, in most cases, don’t
allow cross-border availability. Market-led solutions as discussed during the Licences for
Europe process might therefore not be an adequate solution for cross-border availability and
access to online educational and research resources. Researchers and students need seamless

                                                                                            9
access to digital resources across borders for accessing scientific information, collaboration,
and computing. All barriers to e-science and to infrastructures must be removed by promoting
a digital era.
The different types of knowledge transfer, circulation and access should also be judiciously
factored into research cooperation with non-EU countries (Communication for the
Commission A reinforced European Research Area partnership for Excellence and Growth).



B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights

16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               10
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)
No it is not. The research community wants to disseminate its scientific results as widely as
possible. Although some of the research publications do have a small audience, applying a
targeting approach would increase the burden of the scientific community. A way to provide
more clarity would be to apply the ‘country-of origin’ principle.


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
NO
Universities and research organisations are not the right holders of scientific publications in
most cases. In the event they are, they often waive their rights to the original authors. Authors
of scientific publications do not get remunerated for their publications; the recognition and
impact of their articles are more important to them. Authors either transfer their rights or they
give an exclusive licence to a publisher. The enforcement of the rights is in most cases
handled by publishers. Possible clarification of the scope should not create barriers for the
research community to disseminate its output as broadly as possible.




22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                              11
2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
YES
The ‘making available’ right should be technology neutral and a possible bundling of rights
would be preferable if this would facilitate the clearance of rights.
The legal requirements need to be clarified and articulated in such a way that users can
understand what is permitted or not.


3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
NO
Hyperlinks merely operate as a reference to content already made publicly available by a right
holder on another website, blog or wiki. They facilitate the availability of content online and
as hyperlinks do not give access to full text they should NOT be subject to authorisation of the
right holder.
Linking is an imperative aspect of internet use and essential to the architecture of the internet.
It is common use for researchers to link to online resources. This is also the case for other
types of linking than hyperlinking such as the semantic (machine readable) linking used in the
Linking Open Data project.

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
NO
No, a non-consumptive copy as viewing or caching should not be subject to authorisation of a
right holder. Caching and viewing are essential for the functioning of the internet. Viewing a
webpage can be considered as reading a book in the analogue world and what is permitted in
the offline world should not be prohibited in the online world.
Asking permission for non-consumptive use would raise transaction costs tremendously and
would create legal uncertainty. It would also destroy the function of the internet as all kinds of
information will be inaccessible.


4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
NO OPINION


14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]

27
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              13

C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
YES


16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
A registration system would reduce the transaction costs inherent to asking permissions for
use for users and right holders. It would also give clarity about ownership and the status of a
work and it helps mitigating the problem of new orphan works in the future.
To fully function a registration system should be authorative, comprehensive and the
information should be easily accessible without costs. A system must be mandatory otherwise
it will miss its point.


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
A registration system is arduous for authors when they have to registrate each work they
create. Scientific authors are not likely to register as their incentive for publication is not a
possible remuneration.
To set up, maintain and to regulate a registration system a monetary investment has to be
made and it is unclear who has to make this investment.
The necessity of being mandatory is not in line with international agreements.
An open registration system might be hindered with privacy regulations.
18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
Certain elements of copyright protection could be available only for those authors who
register such as the eligibility to collect royalties or the possibility to start certain enforcement
actions. Registration could be made a prerequisite for longer copyright protection than the
minimum term required by the Berne Convention.

29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             14
D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
The EU should promote that all identifiers as well databases of rights ownership and
permissions are interoperable and that possible new identifiers and systems are developed in a
true multi stakeholder approach.
The EU should uphold that systems must be based on open standards, scalable and available
to all content creators free of charge. The systems must be publicly accessible by machine
readible interfaces.



E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,

31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
NO
The term of protection should be shortened and be brought in line at least with the minimum
term required by the Berne Convention.
The current term (the lifetime of the author plus 70 years) creates an enormous number of
resources, which are not commercially interesting anymore but which cannot be used in
teaching and research because many of those resources are not digitally available because of
their orphanage.
The current term of protection is also in contrast with the rapid development in STM research
and the publications in these fields.
In addition the European Union should work in the relevant international fora to further
reduce the term of protection. This should include efforts to agree on a system where
extended copyright protection after an initial automatically granted term would be only
granted if the work is registered by the right holder. The duration of the initial term should be
brought into line with the duration of protection of other IP rights such as patented inventions
(20 years), databases (15 years) or industrial design rights (25 years). Given this, 20 years
appears to be a reasonable initial term of protection that should guarantee protection to the
vast majority of protected works.
In the interest of the advancement of science it should be examined if it is possible to establish
a cut-off date for copyright protection that ensures that all works published before that date
are not protected by copyright anymore. Such a cut-off date could vary by sector. A criterion
influencing the cut-off date for research papers could be the situation that the research is
funded by public money.



 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.

36
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
37
   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

                                                                                                            16
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
YES
Each researcher or student should have the same level of access to knowlegde independent of
the Member State where they live or work.

Lack of harmonisation creates legal uncertainty for researchers and students working or
studying in another country. The fact that limitations and exceptions are optional hampers
seamless collaboration between international research and student communities and creates
38
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
39
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           17
friction costs when trying to engage in international activities. It creates an uneven level
playing field for researchers and students in Europe.

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
YES
All limitations should be harmonised to the fullest extend possible. As the limitations and
exceptions are drafted in line with the three-step-test they do not interfere with the normal
exploitation or the work or otherwise harm the legitimate interests of right holders.
It is important that contracts do not override limitations or exceptions.




23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
YES
A new limitation for text and data mining should be added to the existing closed list of
limitations and exceptions. Furthermore education would be helped if private individuals
could share protected works for non-commercial purposes under an exception.
Also adding a more open and flexible limitation to ensure that limitations can keep pace with
technological and social changes is needed.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
YES
  The closed list of limitations and exceptions does not provide enough flexibility to be
functional in an environment in which technology rapidly develops and changes. To be able to
enjoy limitations and exceptions they should be adaptable to the changes in technology.
Copyright exists in order to balance the rights of authors and right holders with those of users.
As this balance became unbalanced in favour of right holders over the last few years, the
balance should be restored to a level where innovation, research and education will be
encouraged.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
The best approach would be built-in flexibility in reaction to technological changes. This
should be a mandatory exception in all Member States so that it has minimal effect on the
internal market.
An alternative could be a European Copyright Code such as the Wittem Copyright Code.


                                                                                              18
26.   Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a
problem?
YES
As there is only one mandatory exception and as Member States have implemented different
limitations and exceptions an unclear situation has risen for researchers and students working
or collaborating across borders. What is legal in one country might be illegal in another
country.



27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
The concept of ‘fair compensation’ could also be ‘no compensation’. This notion is important
to especially educational institutions.
The move to open research data and open educational resources would imply more sharing
and not more compensation for usage.



A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number

                                                                                           19
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
YES
Universities have established institutional repositories in which the output of their research is
deposited. For each work that is deposited in the repository the university has to sign a licence
with the author that the work can be archived and preserved. In cases the author has
transferred or licensed the right to preserve the work, the university has to negotiate with the
publisher to get this right.
Universities are subscribed to online access, which is offered as a temporary service. The
licences for use contain a so-called post-termination clause that regulates continuous access to
the content once the agreement is terminated. A university is not allowed to archive the
content it already has paid for, as was the case in the analogue world. In the event of
termination of the licence, access to the content is via media sent to the licensee by the
publisher or via access to the publishers’ website for which a university has to pay. Such
media are often protected by technical protection measures that cannot be circumvented.
Preservation of the material for future use can be hindered by this.


29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Article 5(2)(c) of the 2001/29/EC should be broadened to allow institutions to make
reproductions of all works in their collections as long as they are not intended for indirect or
direct commercial advantage.
Article 6 of the 2001/29/EC directive should be revised in order to enforce exceptions and
limitations and to ensure legitimate utilizations of protected works, regardless of format or
mode of dissemination.
Libraries should be granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual right to archive complete
copies of subscribed online materials, and to use the archived materials in the event that
access on the original platform is discontinued or suspended. An exception should ensure, at
the request of the library, the availability of back-up files for long-term preservation,
regardless of the format of publication.
The national library or other national infrastructure of the country of utilization (i.e., the
country of the purchasing library) could be responsible for local hosting for preservation
purpose, as well as for permanent access and use of the licensed materials by authorized users
after the termination of a license contract.


30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?



                                                                                              20
The main element would be a broadening of the existing exception in article 5(2)c of the
2001/29/EC directive. Instead of only allowing specific acts of reproduction, it should allow
all acts of reproduction necessary for publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments
to achieve aims related to their public-interest missions. This should include reproductions
made as part of mass digitisation efforts, back-up copies and reproductions for format
shifting.

Reproductions should be limited to internal use, which is not for direct commercial or
economic advantage or use in line with other exceptions and limitations allowed for by the
2001/29/EC directive. Reproductions would explicitly be allowed for the purposes of
increasing the operational efficiency and reducing costs of the beneficiary institutions. The
exception should only apply to works that are part of the permanent collection of an
institution and not to works that have been loaned from other institutions (such as interlibrary
loans or loans from museum exhibitions).

Article 6 of the 2001/29/EC directive should be revised in order to enforce exceptions and
limitations and to ensure legitimate use of protected works, regardless of format or mode of
dissemination.

31.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
Libraries are subject to complex and lengthy negotiations with publishers, database vendors
and right holders, impacting collection development, duration of access, permitted uses.
                                                                                              21
Libraries often entrust negotiation and management of contracts to national or regional
institutional consortia to increase their bargaining power.
At present, certain provisions of licences are not satisfactory for several reasons:
Technical accessibility and interoperability: Format shifting and other adaptations should be
permitted not only for long-term preservation purposes, but also for remote access when
needed to ensure technical accessibility and usability by print impaired people, or to
effectively integrate acquired or licensed materials in library information systems, according
to international standards of interoperability. But the right holder or the database producer can
refuse to grant a special licence, and, in case of born-digital content, to temporarily remove
the technological protection measures in order to facilitate the use, and often they refuse. It
should be noted that technical protection measures (TPMs) protect not only content, but also
metadata related to those content, so that the legal protection of TPMs affects also access and
reuse of metadata for integration within library catalogues and information discovery systems.


Utilizations for distance learning courses and programmes: most publishers do not allow the
extraction and reuse of reasonable portions of protected works acquired or subscribed by
libraries or other cultural institutions and their communication to registered users through e-
Learning platforms. It is generally accepted that the exception provided by Art. 5(3)(a) of the
2001/29/EC Directive covers both face-to-face and distance education, and that the
fundamental rights it protects (freedom of expression, right to be informed, right to learn) are
of crucial importance. The enforcement of this exception at European level, prohibiting its
restriction by national legislations, or by licences is of utmost importance.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
The EU should broaden article 5(3)(n) of the 2001/29/EC Directive so that institutions can
make available works outside of dedicated terminals on the premises for research, education
and private study.
The exception should be mandatory.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries

                                                                                              22
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain with specific examples

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
There are fundamental differences between in the management of physical and online
collections. Licences regulate online collections and the provisions of the licences do not
always accommodate the use that is envisaged in educational and research institutions. The
Dutch Copyright Act (DCA) has an exception for classroom use but the DCA has no
exception for the digital equivalent of the classroom: the virtual learning environment.
As access to online collections is seen as a service the VAT is 21% instead of the 6% of
physical books and journals. This has an enormous financial impact on universities and
research institutions

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

                                                                                             23
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO OPINION


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
YES

44
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
45
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             24
Students and researchers increasingly make use of audio and audio-visual materials. They are
becoming as important as books and journals.



B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
YES
The exception in the 2001/29/EC Directive for education is broadly defined but most Member
States have not implemented this exception as broadly as allowed by the Directive. The
implementation also differs from Member State to Member State which creates legal
uncertainty especially for universities with international students. What is allowed in one
Member State might be illegal across the border.
Teaching material should be available as widely as possible.
Not all works protected by copyright are easily available for teaching. It is hard to include
sound recordings, films and/or broadcasts in a learning environment especially if the works
are from a right holder in a foreign country. An example of this is the use of BBC material. It
is practically impossible to get a licence from the BBC to use its material for teaching
purposes.
Universities are developing Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that can be made
available to a cross border audience and where therefore multiple copyright laws apply.
Educators and developers of open educational materials are less likely to publish and share
their resources because they are not able to properly assess the legal consequences in other
Member States.

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Limitations or exceptions nor licences for access and use of scientific material do allow the
extraction and reuse of reasonable portions of licensed materials and their communication to
the authorised users in an e-learning environment. Therefore a broad, clearly defined,

46
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                               25
educational exception that should be mandatory for all EU countries would best solve the
problem. This mandatory educational exception should cover all uses of all types of works
(including multimedia works) for illustration of teaching, regardless of the institution.
The exception should allow for use of any copyrighted material including text, film,
multimedia for illustration of teaching in classrooms and in online courses. It should also
allow for using copyrighted works in teaching compilations, whether analogue or digital.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
The use of content for illustration for teaching purposes is mostly facilitated by licences but
the provisions are often limited when it comes to use in virtual learning environments.


45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
As the present exception is already broadly defined the mandatory aspect should be
imperative. The exception should be broad, clearly defined and should include the use of all
type of works (including multimedia) in whatever format.

46.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
YES
The lack of harmonisation of the exception for research leads to legal uncertainty, which
frustrates the sharing and re-use of scientific publications and is therefore a barrier to
successful research and innovation.

47
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                            26
The formulation ‘to the extent justified by the non-commercial nature’ is not very clear and
open to interpretation. Furthermore this non commercial use might be in contrast with one of
the pillars in Horizon 2020 ‘Societal Challenges’ in which research and society together have
to address societal problems and to come to solutions together.


48.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Introduce a new broader mandatory exception for research.


49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
In the Netherlands there is a proposal to amend the DCA to promote and encourage open
access. The proposal has not been accepted yet.
The EU promotes in its Recommendation of 17 July 2012 on access to and preservation of
scientific information, that open access policies that provides readers with access to publicly
funded peer-reviewed scientific publications and research data free of charge as early as
possible in the dissemination process, and enable the use and re-use of scientific research,
results should be implemented. Many universities have an open access policy, with or without
a mandate for depositing, but copyright policies of publishers restrict the immediate making
available of the scientific publication most of the time.
Universities have hired staff explaining the legalities of making available scientific
publications through the repository of the university to the authors. In most cases authors still
transfer their copyright to publishers, which makes immediate open access even more
difficult.



D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the

48
   Article 5 (3)b of Directive 2001/29.

parties         such        as       associations        for        blind      and      dyslexic        persons

persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).



51
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              28
Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
YES
There are several obstacles when researchers try to deploy text and data mining (TDM). For
TDM researchers need massive amounts of full text across disciplines. This text needs to be
structured and machine-readible and the metadata and formats need to be standardised.
Researchers should have the possibility to access, copy, analyse, annotate and to relate to
existing information; they need creative freedom in combining and transforming data.
Research is hindered because there is uncertainty whether the existing framework of
intellectual property rights does permit TDM. The existing licensing schemes do not advance
TDM either. The licensing schemes are fragmented and complex, and the terms are not
always very clear on what is permitted and clauses (if they exist) are very restricted. The
possibility of cross border availability is often non-existent.
As the content is collected from multitude of resources the scattered portfolio of licences
within institutions exclude access to many resources. Access to open content is not always a
solution as there is unclarity whether open content licences do permit TDM.
Negotiations about permission for TDM are burdensome and the transaction costs are high.
Within an institution there is a variety and heterogeneity of needs/project and aims and

52
  See the document “Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring more content online”:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf .


                                                                                                     29
asking permission for each individual project of each researcher is considering the existence
of many publishers very time consuming and costly.
Technical protection measures can also be a barrier to TDM.
Also the Database Directive is an obstacle to TDM because it prevents copying of large
portions of the database.
54.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Introducing an exception for TDM. If an institution has lawfully required digital content,
including databases, the right to read should encompass the right to mine.


55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
In the rapidly evolving digital environment, taking into account the diversity of TDM
applications and sources from which data can be extracted, TDM would be facilitated by a
flexible, open ended exception, which is mandatory and implemented the same way across
Europe. The exception for TDM should be for research purposes, with no differentiation
between commercial/non-commercial and which cannot be overridden by contract.
The use of material for TDM should override technical protection measures.

56.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
A move to open access publications and encouraging open content licences, which allow for
TDM could remove some of the problems TDM encounters momentarily.

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
When TDM is conducted under a licensing scheme the use of derivative works as a result of
TDM is restricted to the authorised users within an institution. This does not help the new
research across institutions or borders.


F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of

53
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           30
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

 IV.     Private copying and reprography

                                                                                       32
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
YES
In general, copyright rules are difficult for researchers and students. To find out what is
permitted is very time consuming and not transparent at all. Also dealing with collective
management organisations cost a lot of time (administration and discussion) and very
inefficient.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59
NO
In the event that a work a licensed the licensor has already paid for use and an end user should
not pay another time for uses compliant with the licence terms.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?60
YES
Added value would be reasons for transparency.


Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
NO OPINION

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?

     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
NO OPINION

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
It is not always clear in the current framework who can be considered as an intermediary.
Therefore it must be made very clear that when an intermediary is acting as a mere conduit
the intermediary is not liable for infringements. Mechanisms must ensure that the freedom of
expression is not hindered by liability of an intermediary.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?

64
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
65
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
66
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
67
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           36

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 YES


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
Due to fast developments in the world of education and scholarly communication a consistent
framework for copyright should be dealt with as soon as possible.


VIII.     Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
The copyright law reform at the European level should also look at overlapping directives.
The copyright regime should be simplified and more in balance. Furthermore the copyright
framework should consist mechanisms to ensure that licence clauses cannot override existing
exceptions and limitations.
The harmonisation of the copyright framework should not lead to regulations that would be
based on absolute minimum standards and less progressive than the current regime.
