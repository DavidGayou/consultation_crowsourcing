     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)

2.     [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.

We are never asked to grant multi-territorial licenses because, as an organisation dealing with
the collective management of the rights of performers, we are only/mainly active in the field
of remuneration rights and rights to compensation, which are in principle anchored in the
territory.

would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
Due to different cultural and legal traditions, territoriality is the basis of the copyright and
related rights system in Europe. By licensing by territory, creative industries tailor their
content for the benefit of end users. Territorial distribution also plays a crucial role in the
financing of the production of European films. Consequently it is essential for the protection
of cultural diversity in Europe.
Furthermore, the principle of territoriality is one of the pillars of international protection of
the Berne Convention. The Court of Justice of the EU has also in several decisions explicitly
confirmed the “principle of territoriality” of copyright.

  NO OPINION


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-

services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
The current system based on reciprocal agreements between collective management
organisations is sufficiently flexible and effective. No further measures are required as there
are no obstacles in respect of performers’ rights in terms of the cross-border availability of
content services.
The vast majority of performers largely benefit from remuneration rights or rights to
compensation which are administered by performers’ collective management organisations.
These rights have to be distinguished from exclusive rights. They do not grant performers a
right to authorise or prohibit but merely a right to receive equitable remuneration. This
remuneration is payable to a performers’ collective management organisation regardless of
who the organisation’s members are. Via reciprocal agreements remuneration is then
distributed to the respective sister societies, as appropriate. Performers’ collective
management organisations have already considerable experience in this area.
Neither can there be any obstacles in respect of the cross-border availability of content
regarding the exercise of performers’ exclusive rights to making available on demand of their
performances, as this right cannot be satisfactorily exercised by the vast majority of
performers. This is where we feel there is a real urgent need for action. The EU legislator
could guarantee the fair remuneration for the making available on demand of their
performances, by introducing a right to equitable remuneration when a performer’s rights are
transferred/assigned to the producer. Such a right should be administered by performers’
collective management organisations and would not create an obstacle to the cross-border
availability of content.
     NO OPINION

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.




16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.

                                                                                                           10
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.         The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)


19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level

                                                                                                               11
Firstly: what is it that should be clarified?
The scope of the making available right is not sufficiently clear in cross-border situations, but
it should first be noted that it is equally unclear in situations occurring inside an individual
Member State (“non-cross-border situations”). In fact, several fundamental questions arise
even if the act is limited to a single territory. Two rights are involved in the act of making
available on demand: the reproduction right and the communication to the public/making
available right. We think clarification is required in respect of both.

The reproduction right and the making available right in a non cross-border scenario:

Hypothetical scenario:
A service provider based in Member State A wishes to make a work available via his website
to consumers in Member State A. To avoid confusion we assume that the website and related
server are hosted/situated also in Member State A and that technical measures are in place to
prevent (to the extent possible to do so) consumers in other Member States from accessing the
site.

Significant questions arise:
1.      Does more than one act of reproduction occur and if so where does it occur?
2.      Do any acts of reproduction require authorisation or do they fall under any of the
current exceptions and limitations in the acquis communautaire?

Question 1: Does more than one act of reproduction occur and if so where does it occur?
Clearly, the service provider must reproduce the work onto his server (“the initial
reproduction”) so that he can provide a service.
A further (temporary) reproduction occurs when the work is transmitted electronically by the
ISP from the server to the consumer.
For the service to make sense, the consumer must be able to access the work without
infringing copyright or related rights. To do so, an act of reproduction is necessary when the
work is downloaded onto the consumer’s computer/device either permanently, or temporarily
(e.g. in the case of streaming).
Thereafter, the consumer is capable of making numerous further reproductions i.e. “private
copies” of the work downloaded.
In the hypothetical non cross-border scenario referred to, these acts could only take place in
Member State A.

Question 2: Do the acts of reproduction require authorisation or do they fall under any
of the current exceptions and limitations in the acquis communautaire?
Clearly, the service provider must obtain authorisation from the rightholder to reproduce the
work on his server.
With regard to the temporary reproduction that occurs when the work is transmitted
electronically by the ISP from the server to the consumer, no authorisation would be required
on account of the fact that this act of reproduction falls under the exception to the right of
reproduction contained in article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.
With regard to the consumer, for such services to be legally practicable, it is necessary that
there is a way whereby the consumer is able to make the necessary reproductions to access the


with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

                                                                                                              12
works, without infringing the rights of rightholders. The first reproduction (i.e. the one
download from the server onto the consumer’s device) should be considered to be an
authorised act.
Thereafter, numerous further unauthorised reproductions of the work may be made (e.g. onto
other devices owned by the consumer).
In the case of Member States that have chosen to provide for a private copying exception in
their national legislation, these further reproductions will fall under the private copying
exception contained in Directive 2001/29/EC, provided the criteria of its article 5(2)(b) are
met.
Of particular significance to performers is the criterion contained in the Directive 2001/29/EC
that private copying remuneration should be payable. In the case of Member States where no
private copying exception exists, in order to avoid infringing copyright, each individual
consumer would need to obtain the authorisation of the rightholder to perform the
reproduction.

The VG Wort Case (Verwertungsgesellschaft Wort (VG Wort) v Kyocera et al. Joined Cases
C-457/11 to C-460/11)
The European Commission’s “Study On The Application Of Directive 2001/29/EC On
Copyright And Related Rights In The Information Society (The "Infosoc Directive")” contains
a detailed analysis of the reproduction right included within the act of making available on
demand. However, it addresses neither the private copying exception and how it affects the
act and commercial realities of making available on demand, nor the judgment in the VG
Wort case.
This judgement provides clarity to a vital aspect of the act of reproduction. It finds that in a
Member State where a private copying exception exists, a consumer does not require a license
(or “authorisation”) to make subsequent reproductions after the initial download of the work.
In fact, any such license has no legal effect. However, such authorisations would be required
in Member States where no private copying exception exists.

The reproduction right and “making available” in a cross-border scenario:

Hypothetical scenario:
A service provider based in Member State A wishes to make a work available via his website
to consumers in Member States A, B and C. To avoid confusion, it is to be assumed that the
website and related server are hosted/situated also in Member State A. In Member State B, a
private copying exception exists by virtue of Directive 2001/29/EC. In Member State C, no
such private copying exception exists.

The same questions raised above regarding the substance of the reproduction right (i.e. the
number of reproductions made, and whether they fall under any exceptions and limitations)
remain valid in the cross-border context.

Question 1: Does more than one act of reproduction occur and if so where?
As above, (i) the service provider must reproduce the work onto his server (“the initial
reproduction”), (ii) an ISP will make a temporary reproduction when the work is transmitted
electronically from the service provider’s server to the consumer’s device, (iii) consumers
must reproduce the work to be able to access the work and (iv) consumers will make further
reproductions of the work they download.
It is unclear under the existing acquis communautaire where these reproductions occur and
specifically whether a country of origin or country of reception principle should be applied.

                                                                                             13
It would be feasible to interpret the existing acquis communautaire to the effect that the initial
reproduction made by the service provider is made in the Member State where the service
provider (i.e. the uploader) instigates the reproduction. Alternatively, it can be argued that it
occurs in the Member State where the server onto which the initial reproduction is made is
located.
In either case, if either the service provider or the server is located outside the EU, the
reproduction ought to be deemed to be made in the Member State in which the service
provider is (“commercially”) established or most closely connected to in order to prevent the
“avoidance” of EU law.
There is a lack of legal clarity regarding where the act of temporary reproduction by the ISP
takes place, however since it is highly likely to be subject to the exception in article 5(1) of
Directive 2001/29/EC, the issue is theoretical.
Subsequent to the initial reproduction, the numerous reproductions made by consumers may
be deemed subject to the national law of the Member State in which they are situated.

Question 2: Do any acts of reproduction require authorisation or do they fall under any
of the current exceptions and limitations in the acquis communautaire?
Following the first reproduction made by the consumer, the subsequent reproductions they
make (e.g. onto other devices/carriers) would not require authorisation since they should be
considered as private copies falling under article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC, provided
that the criteria of that Directive are met, including the payment of fair compensation to the
performer. In Member State C, where no private copying exception exists, any reproduction
the consumer would make (i.e. when the work is accessed) would infringe the rightholders’
rights. Depending on national law, the service provider may be jointly liable for such
infringement.
In either scenario, as indicated in the Commission’s “Study on the Application of Directive
2001/29/EC” on page 161, depending on national law, the service provider may also have to
obtain authorisation covering the reproductions made from the server onto the consumers’
devices.

The “communication to the public” right:
While question 8 specifically refers to Directive 2001/29/EC and the making available right in
cross-border situations, there are many instances when there will be a “digital transmission”
in a manner which is “not on demand” and thus does not fall under Directive 2001/29/EC.
Examples would include internet radio and forms of webcasting. These acts of “digital
transmission” would fall under the scope of Directive 2006/115/EC article 8 and not Directive
2001/29/EC article 3.
This distinction is of great importance to performers in both cross border and non-cross
border scenarios.
Under Directive 2006/115/EC article 8(2), performers are entitled to equitable remuneration
in respect of the communication to the public of a phonogram published for commercial
purposes. (The acquis communautaire ought also to provide equitable remuneration for the
communication to the public of audiovisual works, but this anomalous gap has not yet been
rectified).
Under Directive 2001/29/EC there is no right to equitable remuneration when a work is
communicated to the public/made available on demand.
This difference between the two rights is used to escape the obligation to pay equitable
remuneration rightly due to performers.
Turning to the scope of article 8, Directive 2006/115/EC, in Società Consortile Fonografici
(SCF) v Marco Del Corso, Case C-135/10, the CJEU concluded that “communication to the

                                                                                               14
public” under Directive 2006/115/EC meant something different to what it meant under
Directive 2001/29/EC.
The court held that existing case law applied only to the exclusive right of communication to
the public (Directive 2001/29/EC) and was not meant to be applied to the right of
remuneration now contained in Directive 2006/115/EC article 8. This approach seems hard to
justify since the acquis communautaire does not provide the basis for making such a
distinction and in fact provides several reasons for the rights to be dealt with on the same
terms.
Logically, the term “communication to the public” should make sense by itself and not have
different meanings under the two relevant Directives.

Secondly: how can this be clarified and what type of clarification would be required (e.g. as
in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)?
Relevant to both the act of reproduction and the act of communication to the public/making
available on demand is the fact that the CJEU has provided some clarification which clearly
favours a country of reception/targeting/accessing approach as opposed to a country of origin
approach. Certainly, a review of the acquis communautaire should confirm which approach is
to be used and ensure that it is harmonised throughout the EU.
The existing structure of performers’ collective management organisations is such that they
would be able to efficiently collect and distribute monies received under a country of
reception principle, whereby one collective management organisation would collect the sums
and thereafter distribute them among its sister collective management organisations.
Equally, performers’ collective management organisations are equipped to administer the
rights of performers under a country of origin principle. This principle is used in the broadly
analogous concept of Satellite Broadcasting and Cable Retransmission Directive and works
reasonably well. In the event that a country of origin principle was used, legislative provision
similar to that contained in Directive 93/83/EEC article 1(2)(ii) (the “Satellite Broadcasting
and Cable Retransmission Directive”) would require to be made to ensure that EU law could
not be avoided by situating the country of origin outside of the EU.
Sadly, the question of whether the country of reception principle or country of origin principle
is used is largely theoretical for performers. As elaborated at questions 73 and 74, the
performers’ exclusive “making available right” contained in Directive 2001/29/EC is almost
always transferred to the producer for little if any return and said Directive contains no right
to equitable remuneration upon the transfer of such exclusive right.
This factor, combined with the practice of many parties who attempt to avoid paying equitable
remuneration under Directive 2006/115/EC by claiming that a digital transmission is “on
demand” when it clearly is not “on demand” means that performers derive very little if any
financial benefit when their performances are exploited online.
This would be the case regardless of whether the country of reception principle or country of
origin principle was used.

transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
Yes, a performer’s rights could be affected. For example in Spain, performers are entitled to a
payment of equitable remuneration whenever their works are made available on demand. If a
work was made available on demand in e.g. Greece, and the country of origin approach was
taken, a Spanish performer may find that he/she received no equitable remuneration for the
making available on demand of their performance.
However, a solution has already been adopted by the EU Court of Justice, which favours a
country of reception/targeting/accessing approach (see above).
Moreover, some performers’ rights, notably the remuneration rights, are deemed to be
unwaivable. Therefore if such law (i.e. regarding remuneration rights) applies to the making
available on demand, the performer may still be entitled to certain rights regardless of the
scope of the transfer to the producer or the territory (or territories) in which the transfer is
deemed to have taken place.

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)

pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
In most cases the provision of a hyperlink would make a protected work available for the
public to access at a time and place individually chosen by them. Accordingly, it would
amount to an act of making available on demand and thus be subject to the authorisation of
the holder of the “making available on demand” right.
Despite the fact that making available on demand is subject to an exclusive right however,
consumers should be able to participate in online activities which involve providing
hyperlinks in a manner which does not infringe copyright or related rights. A system whereby
consumers receive authorisation and rightholders receive remuneration for the use made of
their works and performances in this manner, could resolve that.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

4.        Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

[Open question]
It would be extremely difficult if not impossible to put in place a practical solution which
would prevent people selling a file that they have purchased. There would be damaging
economic consequences for rightholders, as sales would be lost. If such a framework were to
be conceived, it would have to take into account these consequences.

  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              18
C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

names of all performers involved, date of the recording, …) should be encoded in the
metadata of every recording. This would facilitate an efficient collective rights management
system.

D.         How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             19
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub 34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?

E.       Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
The adoption of Directive 2011/77/EU on the extension of term of protection is an important
step towards a better recognition of the value of performing artists’ work and creativity.

The term extension regarding phonograms effectively reduces the gap between the existing
protection for the works of authors, which lasts until 70 years after their lifetime, and that of
performers, whose protection was previously limited to an overall period of 50 years (now 70
years).
This term extension ensures that performers do not see some of their own performances fall
into the public domain while they are still alive, and when they still count on intellectual
property rights revenues for a living and to be able to continue performing.
This situation has not changed at all in the digital environment.
Besides the actual extension itself a number of additional measures are provided in the 2011
Directive aiming to improve the situation of performers. How effective these measures will
be, remains however to be seen and depends on their successful implementation at national
level.
Regrettably, the Directive does not answer all the needs of performing artists in Europe. In
particular, the extension of the term of protection granted to performers should not be limited
to their sound recordings but should also cover their audiovisual fixations, as no objective
reasoning can justify that the latter be protected for a shorter period of time.

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and


36
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
37
   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
38
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

                                                                                                           21
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
We see no problems in this respect, neither do we see the need to make exceptions mandatory
and to remove the Member States’ flexibility to adopt certain variations depending on their
own national social and cultural policies. In our opinion there are no indications that the
different national approaches on some exceptions create difficulties for consumers regarding
the use of online services.

39
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           22
Where exceptions and limitations are optional, whenever a Member State decides to introduce
any such exception or limitation, it should comply with all the provisions attached to it. For
example, if a Member State wants to limit the reproduction right by providing a private
copying exception, then it should also provide for fair compensation to rightholders.
Furthermore, any possible action by the Commission addressed to any Member State failing
to properly compensate rightholders for any possible exception and limitation (when obliged
to do so under the EU acquis) should be swift and promptly executed, in order to limit the
damage caused to rightholders.
  NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

  NO – Please explain
See answer to question 21.
  NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
There is no requirement to change the current list of exceptions and limitations. They are fit to
cope with the current off- and online environments. Calls to add new exceptions to the list
often hide an aim to allow the setting up of certain for-profit services without remunerating
rightholders for the use of their works/performances.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain why
The degree of flexibility that is in place now, is sufficient.
  NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and


                                                                                              23
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
A fair use exception does not fit with the European legal tradition. Even in the USA, where a
common law approach is taken, significant uncertainties still prevail, especially regarding new
forms of use – despite decades of judgements concerning the application of the fair use
exception. If the EU was to adopt such an exception, it would equally require decades of case
law in order to clarify its application.
Furthermore, revising the delicate balance of the exceptions or limitations contained in the EU
acquis could disrupt the many licensing contracts concluded between rightholders and users.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?

[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive 43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal

exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.        Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in

3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across

4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted) 45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             28

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?

Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their

States level.

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics 51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,

other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions 54.

 IV.       Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

   These issues were addressed in the recommendations of Mr António Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies. You can consult these recommendations on the following website:

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
The private copying exception applies to the digital environment without any need to adjust
its scope or application.
Moreover, the Court of Justice of the EU has provided important guidance (e.g. Opus,
Padawan, Austro Mechana, VG Wort cases) addressing a number of elements regarding
professional uses, reimbursement systems, funds supporting cultural and social activities, ...
On a number of other aspects the Court’s decision is still pending (e.g. in the Copydan case).
All these decisions have contributed to a coherent system of private copying remuneration by
providing answers to the most important issues that were raised, confirming the validity of the
system in today’s environment.
Neither should the need for such an exception in the digital environment be put into question.
To the contrary: more and more copies are being made as the means by which individuals can
make private copies of copyright protected content are greater than ever before. The exception
provides the freedom to consumers to make private copies and the guarantee to rightholders to
receive compensation for such acts.
Accordingly, private copying levies remain an effective mechanism to compensate
rightholders for acts of private copying. We therefore think that a radical overhaul, such as
that which occurred in Spain, or an adoption of certain of the recommendations of Mr.
Vitorino are neither justified nor required. They would cause great financial prejudice to
performers. Remuneration for private copying is an important source of income for
performers. It amounts to almost one third of all revenues collected on their behalf by
collective management organisations.
If the Commission decided that some action is however required, it could confirm the widely
accepted principles of today and make some recommendations in order to adapt the
administration of private copying levies where necessary. AEPO-ARTIS, together with other
rightholder organisations, has made concrete proposals in this regard.
     NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies? 59
     YES – Please explain
Digital copies (i.e. subsequent copies made following the initial download) should be subject
to the payment of private copying levies.


58
  Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.
59
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                          37
As stated in the response to question 64, private copying regimes remain relevant in the
digital age where the means by which individuals can make private copies of copyright
protected content are greater than ever before. Yet the ability of rightholders to control and
license acts of private copying continues to be unrealistic. Fact is that consumers have long
rejected the application of DRM technology. Moreover, it would raise some concerns vis-à-
vis measures that could potentially invade fundamental freedoms. Private copying levies
therefore provide an effective mechanism to ensure that consumers can enjoy the use of
purchased content without unreasonable restrictions and that rightholders are compensated for
acts of private copying.
We would like to stress here that the approach proposed by Mr. Vitorino on the issue of
licensing of private copies vis-à-vis digital services is legally invalid. The Court of Justice of
the EU countered the recommendation of Mr. Vitorino in the VG Wort case (C-457/11). The
decision of the court does not only provide that any act ‘authorising’ a private reproduction
has no legal effect, it also states that any such purported ‘authorisation’ would have no
bearing on fair compensation owed.
Such an approach does not take into account the realities of performers as they have very little
bargaining power and would therefore deprive performers of the second most important
source of remuneration collected by performers' collective management organisations.
Article 5(2) of the 2001/29/EC Directive should at any time apply vis-à-vis digital copies
considering that the download itself would fall under the licensing agreement and any
subsequent copies made from the downloaded copy should be subject to the payment of
private copying remuneration.
Furthermore, the payment of fair compensation to rightholders is an essential requirement for
the legitimacy of the implementation of private copying exceptions in national jurisdictions.
Its indispensable character was recently acknowledged by the Court of Justice of the EU in
the Padawan case (Case C 467/08).
The decision indicates that there is a direct link between the availability of such equipment to
natural persons and the harm to rightholders that justifies the application of private copying
compensation, without a need to demonstrate such harm.
In the context of digital copies and considering current consumer practices, one cannot
reasonably consider such acts of private copying as causing ‘minimal harm’. Private copying
levies should therefore be payable.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
First of all, it should be clear that the principles of the private copying exception contained
article 5(2) of Directive 2001/29/EC are fully compatible with and should be applicable to

                                                                                               38
online services such as certain cloud computing services. No legislative changes are therefore
needed in order for the exception, and, accordingly, the payment of compensation, to be
applicable to such services that facilitate acts of private copying. It is merely a question of
adapting administrative practices in the collection of compensation for these services.
Electronics manufacturers have often argued against private copying levies as having a
negative impact on the market. This argument is however difficult to understand since this
system of compensation clearly achieves its objectives. Consumers are able to copy legally
onto and between their different devices and rightholders are remunerated for such uses.
Moreover, those manufacturers who have been opposing the system the most are those who
have most benefited as devices and media have been purchased because of their capacity to
record and store creative content.
Indeed, a recent study by Compass Lexecon shows that the level of copyright remuneration
has a strong influence on content creation, but no real impact on – and therefore does not
hinder – the state of development of the digital market. The same should apply to new
business models such as those based on cloud computing.
In reverse, an abolition of the private copying compensation would have a negative impact on
the development of new, high quality content as revenues generated via such systems would
be lost – so would those industries and services which are benefiting from the use of creative
content for the update of their devices, media and services.
In any case, the payment of fees in order to respect copyright and related rights should form
part of the consideration of what are the start-up costs for new businesses where this is
applicable. It constitutes a cost factor that has to be taken into account, just like the cost for
manufacturing the device or for running the service, the hiring of professional services
(marketing agency, legal advice) and the remuneration of employees.
Furthermore, in Spain a recent study confirmed that the phasing out of private copying levies
by the Spanish government decree of 31 December 2011 had no effect on the prices of
devices. There has been no decrease in the price of devices and thus the abolishment of
private copying levies had no positive effect on consumers.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?60
     YES – Please explain
Applied levy tariffs should be separately indicated on all invoices and contracts throughout
the supply chain and on final consumers’ invoices and/or receipts. This way, the final
consumer would be adequately informed of the purpose of the applicable copyright exception
and of the levy. This would help towards a better understanding on what exactly private
copying compensation is and how it is benefiting artists (as a source of remuneration) and
consumers (by supporting cultural activities such as festivals and creation in general). The
enhanced visibility as proposed here would however not necessitate a review of article 5(2) of
Directive 2001/29/EC.

     NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?

71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
As stated above in the response to question 64, the private copying remuneration systems
remain an effective mechanism to compensate rightholders for acts of private copying,
whether off- or online.
A number of decisions of the Court of Justice of the EU have addressed some key questions
on the operation of the private copying remuneration system and have created a coherent
structure fit for today’s environment.
A radical overhaul of the system is neither justified nor required. If the Commission
nevertheless decides that some action needs to be taken, it could confirm widely accepted
principles (see also the various decisions of the Court of Justice of the EU) and make some
recommendations. In particular, the EU legislator could consider the principle of audit clauses
together with the principles of joint liability for the payment of the levy for all entities
engaged in the chain of sales.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
Only a very limited number of performers enjoy a real ability to negotiate on the grounds of
their exclusive rights and benefit from their prerogatives.
For most of the performers, there is no possibility to benefit from their intellectual property
rights in individual contracts. Contracting with audiovisual or sound recording producers
results in a global transfer of all their exclusive rights, for the whole protection period, and,


62
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
63
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                              41
moreover, for a fixed and one-off fee. Such fee does not represent equitable remuneration for
the transfer of their exclusive rights.
Sometimes, notably in the audiovisual sector, some unions have succeeded, on the basis of
collective bargaining or extended collective licensing, not in limiting this transfer, but in
obtaining additional payments as a counterpart to this transfer. However, the extent of these
agreements is very limited, applying only to recordings from some countries without any
positive effect on the use of foreign repertoires. It is only when exclusive rights are subject to
certain guarantees that they become useful to the vast majority of performers.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
  YES – Please explain
The EU acquis ensures the protection of Europe’s performers (musicians, singers, actors,
dancers,…) whose performances bring life and soul to artistic works and grants them essential
remunerations rights. These are an important source of remuneration for performers –
amounting to 94% of performers’ revenue administered by collective management
organisations – and have worked satisfactorily.
Nevertheless, certain issues should be addressed in order to improve the situation of
performers who despite their important contribution to European culture remain the weakest
part in the chain. A number of proposals are made to this effect in the response to question 74.
Of particular importance is the urgent need to revise the acquis by introducing a guarantee
ensuring that performers receive an equitable remuneration when they have
transferred/assigned their exclusive rights to producers for the making available on demand of
their performances online.
Accordingly for such on demand uses, a measure should be introduced in European law,
complementary to the existing relevant provisions of Directive 2001/29/EC. Such a measure
should guarantee that performers, in the event that they transfer their exclusive right for the
making available of performances on demand, enjoy an unwaivable right to equitable
remuneration. This remuneration should be collected from users and managed by performers’
collective management organisations
Individual as well as collective contracts have particularly in this regard proven to be
dissatisfactory.
In respect of collective contracts, some unions have succeeded on the basis of collective
bargaining agreements or extended collective licensing in obtaining additional payments for
the transfer of rights. In these (few and limited) cases, an unwaivable right to remuneration for
the making available on demand of performances should be considered supplementary to such
agreements.
With regard to individual contracts, we refer to the 2002 amendment of the German copyright
law, which aimed at strengthening the contractual position of performers in Germany. It
provides inter alia that a performer may ask the producer to re-negotiate his/her contract in
order to receive an equitable remuneration taking into account changed circumstances after
the conclusion of the initial contract. This amendment has however only led to a limited
improvement of the situation of performers in Germany…

  NO OPINION

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]
Collective rights management and the strengthening of performers rights
Some general rules should be laid down within the EU acquis to guarantee the efficiency of
collective management and to strengthen performers’ rights, namely that:

•       not only the collective administration of remuneration rights should be encouraged,
but also the collective administration of exclusive rights on the basis of mandatory collective
management and of exclusive rights on the basis of the rightholder’s choice.
•       the body liable for payment – in most cases the user – should be clearly determined.
•       when remuneration must be paid to the different categories of rightholders, it should
be equitably shared between them.
•       where a remuneration right is granted to performers, it should not be transferable to
any other party, except to the collective management organisation of their choice for the
specific purposes of collective management.

All these elements are already present in European legislation, but never appear all together in
the provisions covering the corresponding rights.

Performers’ remuneration for making available on demand
Performers generally transfer all their exclusive rights, including the right to making available
on demand, to the producers in return for a lump sum payment. Consequently, they do not
enjoy additional payments for on demand exploitations of their performances. That is the case
for actors and session musicians and singers. Featured musical artists at best receive a royalty
for the transfer of their exclusive making available right, but it is generally calculated in a non
transparent way. It should be advisable that these performers actually receive at least half of
the producer’s net income for that particular type of exploitation.
In general, for on demand uses, a measure should be introduced in European law,
complementary to the existing relevant provisions of Directive 2001/29/EC, guaranteeing that
performers, in the event that they transfer their exclusive right for the making available of
performances on demand, enjoy an unwaivable right to equitable remuneration. This
remuneration should be collected from users and managed by performers’ collective
management organisations.

Removing current inequalities and improving the treatment reserved for performances
in the audiovisual field
The situation of performers in the audiovisual field is currently unacceptable.
In particular, the European legislator has continued to exclude performers in the audiovisual
field from benefiting from any right for the broadcasting and communication to the public of
their recordings. There is no justification why such a right should only be enjoyed by
performers in the audio field.
Therefore, the European legislator should establish respective guarantees in the EU acquis.
Furthermore, the extension of the term of protection and the accompanying measures to the
benefit of performers in Europe adopted in September 2011 are an important step towards a


                                                                                                43
better recognition of the value of performing artists’ work and creativity, nevertheless the
Directive does, regrettably, not answer the needs of performing artists in Europe.
In particular, the extension of the term of protection granted to performers should not be
limited to their sound recordings but should also cover their audiovisual fixations, as no
objective reasoning can justify that the latter be protected for a shorter period of time.
The Commission should therefore comply with its obligation as laid down in article 3(2) of
the 2011 Directive and assess the need for extending the Directive to audiovisual
performances without any further delay.

Possibility to terminate contracts between performers and producers in case of non-
exploitation
The possibility for terminating a contract between a performer and a producer should be
possible at any time during the 70 years term of protection should the recording not be
exploited by the producer in physical and digital format for a period of 2 years.

A similar provision has been introduced in Directive 2011/77/EU on the extension of the term
of protection (the so-called ‘use it or lose it’ clause). The EU acquis should be amended
accordingly.

Transparency and rules regarding royalty payments

It is also needed that the EU legislator ensures that there is increased transparency regarding
individual contracts and in particular:

•         The rate(s) of royalty payment(s) should clearly appear in the corresponding contract
•         No deductions can exceed 20% of the contractual royalty payment
•         Royalty reporting should be compulsory on a half-yearly basis and should include:
o                The different types of exploitation of the recording
o                The amount of sales/income generated by each type of exploitation
o                The price base(s) on which the royalty rate(s) is/are applied
o                The royalty rate(s)
o                The final amount to be paid to the performer

    VI.     Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed

content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?

     VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an

   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
67
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           45
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]
The substance is more important than the packaging or, indeed, the title. Harmonisation
would be beneficial to performers only if it were conditional upon the decent protection of
their rights.


VIII.     Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
Protection under neighbouring rights is crucial for performers, and it needs to be ensured for
the sake of a vibrant culture and a sustainable digital cultural economy. Amending its core is
not desirable, as this would be harmful for the European creative sector. Any change to
copyright and related rights should be justified by convincing economic and legal evidence.
EU authorities should first and foremost address the real problems in the world of culture
today: the technology-induced transfer of value from which internet intermediaries like
Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, etc., benefit at the expense of content creators and, more
broadly, the cultural industry as a whole. The internet’s appeal is largely, if not entirely, based
on cultural content made available online, and so it is only just that whoever benefits from the
exploitation of such content, should share the profits with those who create it.
