     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

UEFA is the owner and organiser of various international European football competitions,
including the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA European Football
Championship and the European Qualifiers. Regarding requests for multi-territorial
licences, such requests are rarely received by UEFA. Media rights for UEFA's football
competitions are tendered on a basis open for all relevant market players to participate and
in compliance with the principles set out in the European Commission's exemption decision
(COMP/C.2-37.398) relating to the joint selling of the commercial rights of the UEFA
Champions League. Rights are offered on a platform neutral basis together with transmission
obligations on linear TV, Internet and mobile platforms. In making such rights available,
UEFA engages its marketing agencies to conduct all commercial sales activities and to assess
how best to meet market demand and tenders are run on a country by country basis in
response to market demand and dynamics. Very occasionally rights may be requested by an
interested broadcaster in respect of more than one territory, reflecting the geographic spread
of such broadcaster's business, however, it is usually felt that to tender rights in such manner
may prejudice competition in each of the individual markets and therefore, as a general rule,
media rights are not made available on a multi-territorial basis, nor is bidding permitted
which links bids across territories. Where a broadcaster acquires rights in respect of more
than one territory and requests to be able to exploit its rights throughout its acquired
territories, such exploitation is not prohibited.
By way of illustration, the media rights for the UEFA European Football Championships
have for recent editions, been tendered on a multi-territory basis within Europe (eg. across
all territories covering UEFA's then 53 member national football associations) before being
tendered separately on a market by market basis. However, no bids were received for the
award of pan-regional rights – even, for example, where a bid is received from a association
of broadcasters, acting from a perspective of collective bargaining, such bids request rights
and exclusivities to be granted on a territory by territory basis on behalf of each of its
relevant individual national member broadcasters in the relevant territory – in addition,
rights are required to be granted on an exclusive basis within each relevant territory.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
YES – Please explain by giving examples
UEFA, as a rule, holds all rights in and to its competitions. Nevertheless, the rights actually
granted to its commercial partners, eg. broadcasters, are inevitably required by the acquiring
party to be granted on an exclusive basis. In almost all instances, those rights in a specific
territory (or territories), which are of core importance in and to that specific territory, are bid
for on an exclusive basis within such territory. The possibility of granting multi-territorial

                                                                                                 9
licences therefore is not something that the market would appear to entertain. In it's
exemption decision relating to the joint selling of commercial rights of the UEFA Champions
League (COMP/C.2-37.398), the Commission has already acknowledged the inevitable
national nature of the upstream and downstream markets in connection with the UEFA
Champions League media rights, due to a combination of: cultural factors; national audience
preferences; TV advertising being adapted to fit tastes and languages of the specific target
territory; varying regulatory regimes; and language barriers. UEFA finds that, generally,
the requests for exclusivity reflect these cultural and commercial realities. It is perhaps worth
emphasising that the national differences in the consumption and demand for sports
(including of course UEFA's competitions) are not differences which have been created
and/or imposed artificially by UEFA but rather are consequences of the natural variation in
national interest (for example, Spanish national team football matches are inevitably of more
interest and value in Spain that in any other European country). The difference is clearly
seen when contrasted with the distribution of, for example, more "traditional" physical goods
and products which have historically been put on the market by manufacturers or suppliers
on with differing national availability and pricing dictated by their own internal commercial
imperatives in order to maximise revenues and profits.
In its exemption decision, the Commission further acknowledged that "a media operator
would be less interested in rights which are available to all of its competitors, as there would
be reduced possibility to distinguish its product from those products of its competitors". It
would therefore appear reasonable to accept that, other than if the situation arose through
the operation of a competitive free market, to require or enable multi-territorial exploitation
of rights will only lessen the attractiveness of UEFA's media rights to individual broadcasters
and thereby materially impact on the revenues which are able to be generated for distribution
within the sport governed by UEFA.
The selling of UEFA's rights pursuant to the tender processes and on the basis of territorial
exclusivity has been acknowledged to bring benefits to the football competitions themselves,
to broadcasters and ultimately the consumers through improved production, consistency of
brand presentation and competition identity, allowing also consumers to "receive a real fair
share of the benefits deriving from it" (COMP/C.2-37.398) (including avoiding the consumer
having to purchase multiple different subscriptions, while still encouraging competition
within the Pay-TV market and therefore greater choice).

6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
NO – Please explain
The question of the availability of exclusive rights goes to the core of the current economic
models upon which broadcasters are reliant. To artificially accelerate or force the removal
of such a basis for grant of rights would materially and significantly impact upon the
commercial attractiveness of the media rights which are offered to the market by UEFA and
therefore the revenues generated. This would have a direct impact on UEFA's ability to, not
only maintain and/or improve the quality of those UEFA competitions to which the rights
relate but also directly impact negatively, the ability of UEFA, its member associations and
stakeholder clubs to develop and promote the sport due to the material reduction in available
funding.
UEFA's competitions are licensed for transmission (together with transmission obligations) to
ensure that our competitions are made available in every EU and EEA country,
predominantly on both a pay and free basis, in every country in the EU/EEA. UEFA has,
even in the absence of any regulatory intervention, applied its policy to require an
appropriate balance between free TV and pay TV distribution with a view to enabling broad
access to all football fans in Europe (and worldwide). It should also be noted that the
Licences for Europe pledges supporting a continuing effort to explore the possibilities of
cross-border portability and referred to above include one signed also by the Sports Rights
Owners' Coalition, an informal group of diverse national and international sports bodies, of
which UEFA is also a member. As reflected in that pledge, developments in this sector must
be made in a responsible manner responding to actual demand and market realities.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this




16
  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

                                                                                                        11
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

 NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)
The current technological landscape, when coupled with the geo-political and economic
landscape of the EU suggests strongly that further clarity is required. If the country of
upload is the only place where the act of "making available" is deemed to have taken place, it
ignores the reality that it is received and therefore exploited in the country where the
viewer/recipient in fact actually is. In terms of UEFA's interests in licensing audio-visual
rights, it is the "consumption" by end-viewers/users of unlicensed content which causes
detriment rather than the uploading of content in isolation. Of course, in the context of live
streaming, the 2 actions are inherently and inextricably linked. The relevant measure
therefore has to be both where the content is uploaded and where it is able to be received. If
a "targeting" approach is adopted, the practical reality is that this would be relatively
unhelpful in real terms. For example, where audio-visual content is made available in
English, is the content being targeted to the UK or Ireland or elsewhere? adding to the
complication is the common status of English as a lingua franca. Does this mean that when
content is made available in English that the content is targeting everywhere? Looking at the
currency for paid services or goods may be equally unhelpful as a measure – for example,
which territory is targeted when the currency is the Euro? The issue is highlighted further
when the language used is also English.
The inherently borderless nature of the Internet (in the absence of specifically implemented
restrictions) is an element which needs also to be recognised – with this context, it would be
unrealistic to consider that a person offering goods or services via an internet platform would
not have envisaged their offer to be seen and acted upon by those in a different country than
their own.

9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
Currently, the prevalent market valuation model for sports media rights incorporates the
concept of exclusive ability to offer such content within the broadcaster's country is a
material factor in assessing the commercial value. Clarification of the territorial scope of the
"making available" right will undoubtedly have an impact on the value of the media rights


23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                              13
licensed by UEFA (positively or negatively depending, of course, on the nature of the
clarification).
If, for example, making available a live stream of a football match in one country but without
access limitations to only allow access within the broadcaster's own territory, is deemed only
to be "making available" in one country rather than all countries in which the stream is either
accessed or accessible, then this would clearly impact on the factual and practical ability for
any rights-holding broadcaster to offer content in a way that creates a unique selling point
for itself in its own country – for a Pay broadcaster, this removes the core market distinction
of offering unique content within its territory - for a commercial free to air broadcaster, it
loses the ability to position the content (and therefore its channel) uniquely towards
advertisers. These factors would be reasonably expected to decrease the market valuation of
media rights sold by UEFA and therefore the revenues which UEFA would be able to
generate.
In addition, in relation to enforcement matters, putting aside more specific issues of practical
detail which are currently being considered by the European Commission in the context of
civil enforcement remedies and processes, if a person transmitting UEFA's content without
authorisation was able to claim that they were only "making available" the content within the
territory where their "uploading" activity was taking place, the extreme consequence could be
that within the EU/EEA, no persons would be able to be held responsible for copyright
infringing activities if their upload host was actually situated outside of the EU/EEA, even if
they themselves and their primary market were within the EU/EEA.

2.     Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
This application does not create problems to UEFA as a rightsholder in its exploitation or
making available of the media rights in and to its sporting events. However, the duality of
rights would appear to cause considerable confusion and is problematic for UEFA in the
context of its management of media rights vis-à-vis unrelated/uncontracted and unauthorised
third parties.
In respect of non-live audio-visual content, the rise and growth of "user-generated content"
services has meant that increasingly, footage from UEFA's competitions is used without
authorisation as or in video content made available on the Internet. In respect of non-live

                                                                                                14
video, UEFA increasingly faces the situation where users (both individuals and companies)
use UEFA footage without authorisation and when faced with the content being blocked or
takedown (eg. due to a US DMCA notice), try to claim "fair use" or "fair dealing" when in the
majority of instances, such defence is simply not applicable due to the nature of the use made
or the US copyright principles not being relevant in the territory in which the user resides
and/or the material being viewed. This is made more complicated by the fact that the 2 acts
of exploitation which require the consent of the copyright owner are not distinguished – (i)
the right to copy; and (ii) the right to transmit or "make available". To take as a specific
example, the Youtube platform, when a user creates a video from UEFA owned footage and
claims "fair use", there is no distinction between the copying which is involved in the creation
of their video file and the act of making available such video publicly on the Youtube
platform. In this instance, the "making available" right must be clearly recognised as not
automatically being affected by any possible fair use/dealing argument which might be
applied to the creation of the video in question.

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
Live sports content streamed on the internet is the most damaging of internet piracy activity
faced by UEFA and sports rights owners generally. The most common means by which
information regarding where to access such unauthorised pirated streams is disseminated is
by way of sharing hyperlinks of/to the video streams. In this context, it is extremely difficult to
take action to manage the dissemination of these links (often hosted on dedicated websites
and forums) as it is asserted that no intellectual property has been infringed by the making
available of the links (as opposed to the content to which they link).

Due to the nature of live internet piracy, this means that it is almost impossible to take
preventative action to avoid the acts of internet piracy occurring and attempts to manage the
issue can only be taken on a reactive basis – however due to the fact that the pirate streaming
is live, the damage is incurred immediately. The reality is that although there is little doubt
that the content has been pirated, through the technical distinction between the content itself
and the hyperlinks, the pirate is able to continue to operate with relative impunity.
We would propose that in the area of sports audio-visual content (particularly in respect of
live streams) in situations where hyperlinks are not simple links to a legitimate (authorised)
webpage (without framing or otherwise "hijacking" the identity of the legitimate webpage) but
links directly to content, the authorisation of the content rights owner should in principle be
required and therefore the making available of such links without authorisation should be a
separate actionable infringement of the owner's rights.


 NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

4.     Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further



                                                                                                16
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

C.       Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.


27
   See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).
29
    For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.

   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification

31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.


35
  Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.
36
  Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

                                                                                                             19
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
37
   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
38
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
39
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
NO – Please explain why
Perhaps due to a lack of knowledge or awareness in this area, users are keen to claim "fair
use/dealings" as an excuse for any kind of copyright infringement, whether such is recognised
or not in the user's jurisdiction. Often users believe, that the US's copyright principles,
including fair use, apply throughout the world, whether or not the user and the copyright
infringement has any connection with the US or not. There is also the belief or expectation
that it is for the rights owner to show that fair use does not apply. Greater "flexibility" is
likely to entail greater uncertainty and this would be greatly detrimental to the rights holder,
the user and also the service provider.


                                                                                             21
In the context of unauthorised use of sports audio-visual content, greater clarity (rather than
flexibility) is needed as regards the application of fair use/dealing and also the obligation of
the service provider to respond and take effective action to address copyright infringement.


NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

A.         Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or

limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.         Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).




51
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              30
Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded

53
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           32
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on

(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
YES – Please explain by giving examples
As referred to above, there are two main instances where so-called user-generated content is
relevant to UEFA's circumstances – (i) the unauthorised live streaming of UEFA matches on
"UGC streaming" platforms; and (ii) the unauthorised uploading by users of highlights of
UEFA match footage (whether in compiled edited form or otherwise) to platforms such as
Youtube.com.
It is of importance to recognise that the first scenario (live streaming) not be recognised or
given an air of legitimacy by including such activities within the understanding of "user-
generated content", despite the label used by the internet platforms whose services are used to
implement the streaming. This is simply piracy.
In relation to footage used in videos uploaded to platforms such as Youtube or Dailymotion, it
should be recognised that this is another area where 2 or more rights are relevant to be
considered in the typical user's activity. UEFA has little objection to the actual editing by
users of highlights compilations or clips for the user's own private use. However, in
uploading videos on the Youtube platform, users are (i) creating the relevant video (thereby
copying relevant works owned by UEFA); and (ii) by uploading the video to be viewed
publicly on Youtube, they are also "making available" the video to the public. Both acts
require the consent of UEFA. This aspect is often ignored. In particular, even if a user was
able to demonstrate that their copying is permitted, whether through the application of fair
dealings or permitted exceptions, such fair dealing or exceptions cannot automatically apply
to the act of making the video available publicly and almost by definition, the making
available aspect is somewhat contrary to the nature of the permitted exceptions/fair dealing.
One particular aspect of UGC sites which is particularly relevant is that for most, if not all,
users who upload content owned by UEFA, they do so specifically for financial gain and to
generate revenues – by way of illustration, Youtube as a platform even encourages the
monetisation by users of uploaded content through the application of their advertising
platform. The relevance therefore of enabling unauthorised "user-generated content" in this
context and for these purposes must be taken into full consideration.

     IV.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
YES – Please explain
UEFA would agree with this and would highlight that one of the largest obstacles faced by an
international right owner such as UEFA, is the lack of consistent legal framework and
effective practical remedies across the EU/EEA region. In addition, the key distinction that
needs to be recognised as separating sports from other content, is that the primary
consumption is live – as the actual events happen in real time – and not delayed in the
manner of films, music or the majority of television programming. This time sensitive element
is one of the practical elements which makes the effective enforcement of UEFA's rights using
the current legal framework ineffective.
It should also be recognised that it is not just infringements which are committed for a direct
commercial purpose which are damaging to the rights owner. In respect of the viewing of
sports, any making available of the content to the public impacts on the value which
legitimate broadcast licensees are able to generate from their investment in acquiring the
rights from UEFA. In addition, while many users do not charge directly to access pirated
sports content, virtually all pirate live streaming services are supported by internet
advertising revenues and even individual users of platforms such as Youtube, do so on the
basis of generating a share of advertising revenues from that platform.
As regards intermediaries in the IP infrastructure, the current practices of many websites,
internet platforms, service providers are of limited practical or real value to sports rights
owners such as UEFA and can only reasonably be viewed as intended to deflect legal liability
while minimising disruption to their operating practices, rather than addressing the rights
and concerns of the rights owners in effective terms.

on the volume of traffic.

   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           39

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
There appears to be a de facto standard for "co-operation" which is that of "compliance" with
the US Digital Millenium Copyright Act, whether or not the intermediary is based in the US
or not. It would be beneficial to have clear, standardised practical and effective
steps/procedures which all intermediaries should be required to follow. Currently UEFA's
priority in combating Internet piracy is not to seek penalties to be imposed on intermediaries
for the infringement of our rights by their service users, but rather to ensure a speedy and
timely (bearing in mind the need to address live streaming as it happens and without delay)
means to prevent or stop the unauthorised live streaming. The current framework simply
does not enable this to happen.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly

                                                                                           40
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
YES
NO
NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

VIII.     Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
If the European Commission determines that the Copyright framework within Europe should
be revised, whether through a new directive or otherwise, sporting events should also be
protected within that framework and the organisers or sporting events should be recognised
as holding an exclusive right to authorise any communication or making available to the
public of its events. The European Court of Justice specified (in FAPL v QC Leisure (C-
403/08) and Karen Murphy (C-429/08) that "sporting events, as such, have a unique and, to
that extent, original character which can transform them into subject-matter that is worthy of
protection comparable to the protection of works, and that protection can be granted, where
appropriate, by the various domestic legal orders. In this regard, it is to be noted that, under
the second subparagraph of Article 165(1) TFEU, the European Union is to contribute to the
promotion of European sporting issues, while taking account of the specific nature of sport,
its structures based on voluntary activity and its social and educational function."
