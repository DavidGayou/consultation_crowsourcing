The Danish government’s reply to the Commission’s Public
Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules

Denmark has, as part of the European Council, previously stated that there must be a
focus on digital economy, innovation and service as a fully functioning Digital Single
Market could generate growth1. As part of its growth strategy, Europe must boost
digital, data-driven innovation across all sectors of the economy. Special consideration
should be given to supporting the reduction of the digital gap among Member States2.

In order to achieve such a position it is necessary to modernise Europe’s copyright
regime to facilitate access to content while upholding intellectual property rights and
encouraging creativity and cultural diversity3.

Initiatives have been taken at EU-level in order to meet some of the challenges
described above. Especially the proposal for a directive on collective rights management
and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online uses4 (hereafter
referred to as the “CRM-directive”) should be highlighted.

The proposed CRM-directive was initiated to approach challenges regarding the
functioning of collecting societies in general (irrespective of the category of rightholders
they represent or the category of rights they manage) and difficulties specific to the
supply of multi-territory licences for the online exploitation of musical works. The aim
of the CRM-directive is to make it easier for service providers to obtain the necessary
licenses for music to be distributed online across the EU and to ensure that
remuneration is correctly collected and fairly distributed to rightholders.

In addition to the CRM-directive Denmark has supported various initiatives to
modernise copyright legislation e.g. by voting for the recent directives regarding term
protection5 and orphan works6 and by signing the Marrakech Treaty7.

The Extended Collective Licensing Model
In Denmark we have a model which serves as an effective and non-bureaucratic
instrument that makes the clearing of rights work efficiently in a digital environment
and thereby ensuring the legitimate interests of rights holders, users and consumers.

The model is characterised by a user entering into an agreement with an organisation
representing the majority of rightholders to the certain copyright protected material the
user wishes to make use of. The rightholders in question have entered into agreements
with a representative organisation by which the rightholders mandate the organisation
to enter into agreements on their behalf. With legal basis these collective agreements
are extended to also include rights of the same category by rightholders who are not
represented by the organisation. The model ensures mass exploitation of copyright
protected material where rights are cleared collectively instead of individually.

The model balances the interests of the rightholders, the service providers, consumers
and wider society’s legitimate interests in having access to creative content and
ensuring proper management of rights and facilitating growth, both monetarily and
culturally, in an effective and proportional way. At present time the model applies to
rights regarding broadcasting, retransmission and reproduction.

In the extended collective licensing model the rightholders have a right to opt-out of the
agreements, which ensures flexibility and safeguards the rightholders’ and the users’
interests.

In the event that an opt-out clause does not provide sufficient protection of the
rightholders the preliminary injunction system in Denmark can be used here as an
effective and swift complement prior to further legal proceedings.

Some of the collective rights organisations in Denmark have, on basis of mandates,
furthermore addressed the multi-territorial challenges, that has accrued by the
developments in the digital environment by entering into bilateral agreements with
equivalent organisations in other Member States regarding multi-territorial usage of
copyright content. E.g. some of the Nordic licensing companies representing performing
artist and producers have entered into agreements regarding webcast services in the
Nordic countries and The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI)
have agreed to general reciprocal documents regarding multi-territorial webcasting to
which approximately 40 countries are signatories.

Share With Care and Innovation Forum
In order to strengthen knowledge of legal online services with cultural content and to
facilitate higher awareness and respect regarding copyright, “the Alliance of
Rightsholders8”, the Danish telecom industry and The Danish Ministry of Culture joined
forces in a campaign named “Share With Care”, launched in 2013. Furthermore the aim
of the campaign has been to influence end-user behavior in a legal direction and to

obtain insight into the end-users’ behaviour in order to better understand their wishes
and to provide corresponding legal services.

In addition to the Share With Care campaign The Ministry of Culture also established
an ongoing forum for innovation with a complementary digital think tank. The think
tank aims to secure an effective base for future collaborations across creative industries
and other business industries including internet service providers and to provide end-
users with legal and easy access to as much creative content as possible while securing
fair remuneration to the right holders.

Both Share With Care and the Innovation Forum have been well received and the
preliminary evaluation shows that the initiatives contribute positively to the
development of new legal services with creative content to the benefit of consumers.

This approach has shown to be an effective supplement to existing enforcement
instruments.

In addition, a coordinated effort has been initiated to ensure that more serious
commercial/comprehensive infringements are dealt with competently, efficiently and
consistently by granting the Public Prosecutor for Serious Economic and International
Crime extended powers to process these matters.

Final remarks
The Danish government generally supports initiatives to modernise copyright
legislation and overcome the fragmentation of this market as long as the initiatives
proportionally balance effective protection of rightholders and the society’s legitimate
interests in having access to creative content in a non-bureaucratic way.

In the Danish government’s opinion it is crucial that any forthcoming initiatives are
based upon thorough analysis of the stakeholders’ input and considerations as well as
experiences of the stakeholders. Evaluations relating to the CRM-directive could also be
taken into consideration before any further steps are initiated.

Prior to the Commission’s eventual initiatives to amend current copyright legislation,
the Danish government kindly recommends that the Commission look further into the
extended collective license model.
