     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" 1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework 2 3 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4 . The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions 5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy" 6 , the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works" 7 and "Content Online" 8 . These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

PRELIMINARY REMARKS
This submission is made by Nuovo IMAIE - Performers’ Rights Collecting Society -
founded by article 7 of Italian Law Act n. 100/2010 to manage, negotiate, collect and
distribute among right holding performing artists of the musical and audiovisual
sectors, the remunerations grant them by the Italian Copyright Law n.633 of 1941
“Protection of copyright and other neighbouring rights” and the International Treaties.
Nuovo IMAIE represent and manages, in Italy, the neighbouring rights of almost
370.000 performers in virtue of direct mandate and indirect mandate (through
reciprocal agreements with sister collecting ). Nuovo IMAIE is engaged in promoting, in
Italy and in Europe, the adoption of policies and laws aiming at ensuring the full
implementation of performers’ rights and the enhancement of the their protection in the
digital context. Nuovo IMAIE operates under the joint vigilance of the Presidency of the
Council of Ministers - Information and Publishing Department - the Ministry of Culture
and the Ministry of Labour and Social Politics.
Nuovo IMAIE welcomes the initiative of the European Commission to launch a
consultation on the review of European copyright rules. However, we regret that the
approach of Commission’s consultation seems mainly driven by the principle that
current European copyright legal framework represents an obstacle to the single market
and to the access of digital content and services. In different sections, the document
seems to put copyright into question while it should have been relied upon the principle
that a robust protection of copyright and neighbouring rights represents the legal and
economic base from which to innovate, invest and expand offers to the consumer. We
expected that a consultation aiming at reforming European copyright would have been
based on the assumption that copyright is the driving force of cultural and creative
industries in Europe. On the contrary, many questions seem also restricting or
misinterpreting the rules already adopted by the European legislation.

Given the above, as collecting society of performers rights, we’ve answered to
consultation’s questions that mainly focus on the aspects that have an impact on
performers rights’, hoping to give our contribution as relevant stakeholder.




                                                                                      7
     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law 9 .
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management 10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11 ; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe” 12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition 13 .
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability 14 .
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term 15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)
     NO
     NO OPINION


2.     [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
     NO
     NO OPINION


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question] With regards to the clearance of performers’ rights in the digital
context, the analysis of the European legal framework in this area clearly shows that it is
practically impossible for collecting societies to grant multi-territorial licensing for the
clearance of performers’rights, unless an updating of the current legislation will
harmonize the level of performers’ protection by removing some of the major issues that
still impede to performers to be remunerated for the exploitation of their content in the
online environment. Please see answer to questions of Section V.


15
   For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a European Copyright Code (establishing
a single title) see section VII of this consultation document.

                                                                                                     9
4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
 [Open question] With regards to all this section, titled “Rights and the functioning of the
Single Market”, the first question should have been “are holders of copyright and related
rights properly remunerated for the access and exploitation of their online content across
Europe?”. On the contrary, this section identifies as first and major issue the lack of
online content services available across Europe due to the territoriality of copyright
clearance, while, instead, nothing in current European copyright law prevents a right
holder to licence his content on a pan- European basis. As a starting point and with
regards to performers’ rights, it has to be underlined that the clearance of related rights
has nothing to do with the licensing of their sound recordings or audiovisual works. The
licensing of these works in the online enviroment is left and should be left to market
driven solutions managed by the producers that are in the position to license the
necessary rights to different digital platforms. As widely known, european citizens
already enjoy of multi - territorial online music services thanks to several players (such
as Itunes, Deezer, Spotify) offering such services in different local-language websites
across all of the 27 European Union countries. With regards to the audiovisual works,
as known, the WG1 of the initiative “Licence for Euorope” is clearly committed to find
real solutions for increasing cross border access and availability of films and TV
programmes. However in this process, the European Film Industry and its relevant
right holders underline that “the pre-sales and sales of audiovisual content per territory
and language version represent one of the main pillars of the financing of productions and
the revenue streams of exploitation” and “ that films are distributed and released on a
national and local basis with particular marketing strategies corresponding to local
cultural specificities 16 ”.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
   YES – Please explain by giving examples
   NO
   NO OPINION


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
   YES – Please explain by giving examples
   NO

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
     YES – Please explain
NO – Please explain There is no need to further European measures to increase cross
border availability of content, while there is the need of legislative measures aiming at
granting European performers with adequate protection of their rights, especially in the
online environment. (please see answers to questions of Section V). How is that possible
that the European problem is how to increase the availiability of online content and
services while the performers still do not enjoy of equal protection and of a proper
remuneration for their rights in the current on line and off line environment ?
     NO OPINION

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC 17 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software 18 and databases 19 .
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders 20 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies 21 , (notably relevant at the start of the transmission
– e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available –
and at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the




17
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
18
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
19
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
20
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
21
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               11
dissemination of the works in digital networks 22 . These rights are intrinsically linked in
digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.         The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public 23 . According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach 24 )
     NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief 25 )?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



22
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
23
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
24
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
25
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                             12
NO The territorial scope of the making available is not put into question, as well as is
not put into question the territorial scope of other rights whose protection and
enforcement is granted at national level. The impact of such principle is particularly
important for performers as they are not granted, in Europe, with equal protection and
do not enjoy of a right to a remuneration in all countries.

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
NO The reproduction right and the making available right are two distinct rights,
clarly protected at European level and we don’t see the reason why this distinction could
represent a problem for right holders rather than a benefit. The application of two
distinct rights keeps each source of remuneration distinct. With regard to users, they
can already clear these distinct rights by addressing both of them with producers in one
single contract.
The real problem (please see answer to questions of Section V) is how to ensure that
performers receive a fair remuneration for the making available to the public or their
content. In addition, it’s worth mentioning that there are still several legal uncertainties
regarding the delineation between the broadcasting right and the making available right
with respect to different types of online transmission. For example, it should be cleared
that non interactive online services should be considered as broadcast-like services for
which performers should be granted with an equitable remuneration.

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU 26 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

26
     Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International) and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).

                                                                                                          13
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU 27 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
There are so many different technical forms of links that is impossible to give a generic
answer to this question: from the digital indexing to the embedding or the framing, each
category of links requires a different approach depending on its consequences. When the
link leads to protected works, it should be verified if this represents an act of
communication to the public in the meaning of the Directive 2001/29. A recent decision
of the CJEU 28 provides clarification to this end. The Court states that linking to
protected content that is freely available, which means already placed in the web with
the authorization of right holders, is not an act of communication to the public and does
not infringe copyright. But when a clickable link makes it possible for users to
circumvent restrictions protecting the content, those users are deemed to be “a new
public”, which requires the permission of the rights holders as they didn’t authorize
such public to access the content.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
     NO OPINION



12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
Unless the aim is to reduce the level of protection of copyright and related right already
granted at European level, we don’t see the reason of this question, as the EU Directive
2001/29 clearly regulates the reproduction right and its exceptions (art. 2 and art 5.1).
Again, we regret that from Commission perspective this case represents an issue to be
addressed for a copyright reform.

4.        Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article) 29 . The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 30 . This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples

14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
It’s quite strange that in question 13, the end user or consumer are asked in what
problems they incurred when violating copyright laws. This is clear also from question
14 where right holders (improperly joined to service providers) are asked what would be
the consequences of a legal framework enabling what today is prohibited. As widely
known, the making available right is clearly different from the distribution right, which
is subject to the exhaustion rule. Art 3 of EU Directive 2001/29 expressly establishes that

29
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
30
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              15
the right of communication to the public and the right of making available to the public
“shall not be exhausted by any act of communication to the public or making available to
the public as set out in this Article”. For the European legislator was obvious that the
resale of cd or dvd is different from the resale of a digital content. However, the
Commission’s problem is to grant consumer/end user with the possibility to resale
digital content they have purchased (downloaded) … “questions arise as to the possibility
for users to dispose of the files they buy”. This means that the Commission considers it
possible to include in a copyright reform the possibility that any digital version (such as
an Mp3 file) of a protected work which is identical to the one downloaded, could be
resold without any authorization and remuneration for the right holders. We think that
this issue doesn’t derserve further comments.



C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute 31 . Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered 32 .

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
 NO First of all it is clear that a registration system can't be a prerequisite for the
protection and exercise of rights. Any compulsory registration system applicable to
protected works would of course reduce the level of protection granted to right holders
by the International Treaties. However, it could be useful a public European database of
sound recordings and of audiovisual works including all metadata of each work and of
its relevant right holders, based on already adopted common standards/identifiers and
codes. This, in particular, could facilitate consumers, users and service providers in the
identification of a protected content and of its right holders and therefore it would be
helpful in the licensing process and rights' clearance.
With regards to performers’ rights management, an important initiative promoted and
supported by SCAPR 33 is the Virtual Recording Database (VRDB), a centralized system
enabling SCAPR members to accurately identify participating artists in sound
recordings and in audio-visual works, which is intended to provide a more efficient
exchange of the performers' information necessary to properly distribute the
remuneration at local level.

31
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
32
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 34 , and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database 35 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition 36 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub 37 is seeking to take such
identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated
licensing across different sectors.




34
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

E.       Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention 38 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC 39 .
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law 40 . In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations
and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a

38
   Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.
39
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
40
   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

                                                                                                              18
normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 41 , these limitations and
exceptions are often optional 42 , in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B") 43 .
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving 44 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions 45 . The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive 46 .

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these

works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

2.        Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements

                                                                                           22
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.

problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries

                                                                                          23
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?

to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?

4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other 47 . Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted) 48 .

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC 49 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems

teaching, including across borders?

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC 50 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC 51 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 52 .

The Marrakesh Treaty 53 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics54 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe” 55 . In the context of these discussions,

54
  For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs 56 . User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions 57 .

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?


56
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

61.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question] First of all, by including this section on User Generated Content under
the chapter on Limitation and Exceptions in the Single Market it seems that European
legislation already foresees an exception for UGC, which is not the case. Therefore, we
prefer to give our general point of view on this issue.It’s worth recalling some interesting
outcome of the Study (published on 2013), commissioned by the European Commission
(DG Markt) on the application of Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights
in the information society. The Study clearly reports that “it is difficult to find substantial
factual and policy considerations that would justify an explicit UGC exception; it is also
difficult to see how a UGC specific exception could be made sufficiently clear and
compatible with international provisions like the three-step test” 58 . Therefore, the existing
exceptions in combination to the three step test already provide a proper framework.
Any other use of protected content that goes beyond, simply follows under the exclusive
rights and therefore it is subject to the proper licensing. The use of pre existing work to
create a new work (such as the case given in foot note 56) and its upload on the web,

     IV.       Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying 60 . Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening

devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees 61 62 .
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments 66 .

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?

payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes

71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy

[Open question] We fully agree with the political view of the Euroopean Parliament as

Therefore, in any further step, we are confident that the Commission will take into
account the positions and aims expressed by the European Parliament.



     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers 67 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 68 . This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?


67
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

[Open question]
A major issue for perfomers of the music sector is that they still do not enjoy of adequate
remuneration for the exploitation of their sound recordings in the online context. As
known, in the online environment, performers benefit in principle from a right granted
by Directive 2001/29, namely the exclusive right for the making available of their fixed
performances. Unlike the provisions adopted for the broadcasting and communication
to the public of phonograms, the right of making available does not give to performers
any right to remuneration but an exclusive right transferred by performers to the
phonographic producers. As a consequence, since the contractual position of the
performer vis-à-vis the producer is weak, most performers are not getting royalties for
the exploitation of their performance through on demand services. That’s why the
making available right simply cannot be administered via cross-border collective
management and it results in no benefit for most performers. In a number of European
countries, the collecting societies administer performers’ rights for certain specific types
of use, none of which are on-demand, on the basis of some limited remuneration rights
such as those due for simulcasting. The collective management across borders of these
remunerations is made via bilateral agreements between the collective rights
management organisations as in the offline environment. To overcome this situation,
there is a need for a legislative measure that provides performers of the music sector
with an unwaivable right to equitable remuneration for their making available right
submitted to the mandatory administration of performers' collecting societies. This is
the way how the making available right was transposed, for example, in Spain. With
regards to the performers of the audiovisual sector, the European legal framework is
even more complex and not harmonized: most countries have introduced the
presumption of transfer of all audiovisual exploitation rights to the producer; few
countries, as Italy, have granted performers with a right to a remuneration for each
single exploitation of their works, while other countries only for the rental right; in most
countries the remuneration due to the artists for the exploitation of their audiovisual
works is not managed by collecting societies. In addition, the type of work relevant for
performers rights also differs country by country: in some countries it concerns all
kinds of audiovisual fixations, in other countries it practically refers only to music video
clips and in others, like in Italy only to cinematographic works and/or assimilated
works. The disparity in the protection granted to audiovisual performers in different
Member States and the different way in which performers’ rights are managed leave
most performers unpaid when their audiovisual fixations are exploited. Therefore,
urgent measures should be introduced at EU level in order to harmonize the audiovisual
performers’ rights' legal framework and to grant audiovisual performers an unwaivable
right to equitable remuneration for each commercial use of their audiovisual works,
including for the making available as it is in Italy 69 . Significant progress to enhance the
audiovisual performers status and rights in Europe will be hopefully achieved with the
69
  Law No. 633 of April 22, 1941 (Italian Copyright Law)
Art 84 paragraph 2. The performers who in the cinematographic or assimilated work play significant artistic part,
even if in a supporting role, are entitled to an equitable remuneration paid by broadcasting organizations for every
use of the said work that takes the form of communication to the public by electromagnetic waves, cable or satellite.
Art 84 paragraph 3. For every use of cinematographic or assimilated works different from that provided for in
paragraph (2), subparagraph (f) of Article 80 the performers referred to paragraph (2) above shall be entitled to an
equitable remuneration, payable by those exercising the exploitation rights, for any separate act of exploitation.
Art 84 paragraph 4. The remuneration provided for in paragraph (2) and (3) above may not be waived and, in the
absence of agreement between IMAIE and the competent union associations of the confederation of industries, shall
be set according to the procedure provided for in Article 4 of Decree Law No. 440 of July 20, 1945
(Art. 80 paragraph (2) subparagraph f refers to performers unwaivable equitable remuneration for rental).


                                                                                                                 37

Audiovisual Performances that will finally provide a clear international legal basis for
the protection of audiovisual performers' rights.

contracts)?

Please see above answer.
     NO – Please explain why

     NO OPINION

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]
As already underlined, most performers don't receive any benefit for the exploitation of
their content in the digital context. Without the introduction of an unwaivable right to
equitable remuneration for the making available right, subject to the mandatory
administration of performers' collecting societies, the introduction at European level in
2001 of performers’ new right for the making available to the public will continue to be
ineffective for performers.
In addition, there is the need to update and harmonize the level of protection of
audiovisual performers by granting them an unwaivable right to equitable
remuneration for each commercial use of their audiovisual works. Nuovo IMAIE has
already stressed the necessity of such interventions in other European Commission
consultations 70 .

     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE 71 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text 72 . Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed

content is used for a commercial purpose 73 . One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure 74 . At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain . There is the clear evidence that the issue on how to deal at
European level with intellectual property rights' protection on the internet is complex
and subject to opposite positions. A clear example is the failure of the Anti-
Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), whose aim was, inter alia, “to address the
problem of infringement of intellectual property rights, including infringement taking place
in the digital environment”. Therefore, in principle, we think that Directive 2004/48/EC
on the enforcement of intellectual property rights still represents a solid basis for the
enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internal market. Any European
intervention in this area should only be driven by a stronger protection of rights holders
by removing the number of obstacles actually preventing copyright industries from
obtaining effective remedies against massive forms of piracy that are causing huge
damages to the European cultural sector, also in terms of job losses.
     NO OPINION

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question] The E-Commerce Directive already provides a suitable framework for
notice and take down procedures. Several intermediaries are already committed to deal
with notifications in an efficient manner ensuring that valid notifications lead to the
removal or disabling of the notified content/offer. A major role is played by search
engines, advertisers and payment providers that should be obliged to provide a stronger
cooperation with the creative industry, by implementing a strict policy against copyright
infringement. Besides, intermediaries should be more engaged in supporting and
promoting educational and awareness campaigns on the value and role of IPR. It’s
worth mentioning that Nuovo IMAIE is strongly committed together with AFI (Italian
Association of Independent Phonographic Producers) and SIAE (Italian Authors and
Publishers Society) in promoting, in Italy, the educational campaign “Respect
Creativity” targeted to middle schools. The campaign aims to make young people aware
about the importance of intellectual property, by introducing them the basic rights of
the rights owners and the core goal of copyright laws as an important foundation for
promoting and defending artistic creativity in Italy and in Europe.


73
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
74
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           39
77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
 NO A single European Copyright Title would require long time while there are other
priorities to be addressed. We think that European efforts should focus on the
implementation already existing legislation by tackling urgent matters such as
performers' difficulty to exercise their rights in the online sector.
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question] As said above this shouldn’t be next step as there are urgent matters that need
to be tackled first.

VIII.     Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.




                                                                                            40
80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question] In the current context of fast growing digital economy and of new
business models, Europe’s citizens can benefit of an evolving variety of platforms,
channels and services to access music and audiovisual content that are the result of the
creative and professional effort of the cultural community in which performers take a
leading role. In this scenario, the European intellectual property legal framework does
not succeed in guaranteeing performers the implementation and enforcement of the
rights they are entitled to. In Europe, performers do not enjoy of equal protection and
still do not get any benefit from the exploitation of their work in the online environment.
We therefore call on the European Commissione to seize the opportunity of this
consultation to restate the importance of performers’ IP rights as part of the economy of
culture, and to acknowledge the necessity for legislative measures aiming at enforcing
and harmonizing performers' related rights, as first issue to be addressed at European
level.
