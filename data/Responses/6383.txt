* Introduction
* Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialized for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content  -  for information, education or entertainment purposes  -  regardless of geographical borders. 
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernize the EU copyright legislative framework with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now. The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact that two groups  -  user-generated content and text and data mining  -  did not reach consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.: "territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonization, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council Conclusions "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy", the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" and "Content Online". These consultations provided valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders' remuneration, particularly in the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

* Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
* Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?  
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights  -  e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law. 
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet  -  e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online e-book seller  -  therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights Management should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-territorial licences in musical works for online services; the structured stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the "same" service is available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can only access their "national" service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence). 
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Germany I frequently encounter issues accessing Youtube videos which are otherwise available in other member states due to GEMA imposed restrictions. This is by far the worst user experience on video and audio content. Amateur or professional video clips are not available because the songs used in the clips have not been licensed for use in Germany, even if the clips are made by amateurs (like in-car camera films, weddings etc).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another issue that I encountered was with Apple, not being able to buy online devices or services while traveling to member countries of the EU for the sole reason that in that country (Netherlands and Germany) I did not have a credit card issued by a local bank.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above  -  what would be the best way to tackle them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copyright should be harmonized across the European Union in order to remove all the uncertainties that exist now through reform and especially to put first the rights of consumers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the EU is a single common market, I think it's very important that digital content is accessible in a uniform way across all member states and, very important, content should be available at the same time. By same time I mean for example a TV show or a movie should be available to everyone from day one in all member states.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If video content would be available to everyone, in every country and in a way which makes it easy for consumers to pay for, it would make a big difference on the way we consume it and would eliminate a lot of the problems that we currently face. This could be accomplished by voluntary action by rights holders (preferably) or enforced by law.
* Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of software and databases.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.  
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the making of copies, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission  -  e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available  -  and at the users' end  -  e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.
* The act of "making available" 
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of "making available" takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the "targeting" of a certain Member State's public. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are "targeted" by the online service provider. A service provider "targets" a group of customers residing in a specific country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations  -  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  -  sufficiently clear? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation 
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different persons/entities. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Linking and browsing 
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are pending before the CJEU in which the question has been raised whether the provision of a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder. 
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public  -  or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linking to copyrighted works must be exempted from copyright by exception/law.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hyperlinking I could say is the foundation of the Internet and how it works from the general public's perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot imagine a world where I would have to be afraid for being sued by who knows what entity or arrested just because I link to some websites or content in order to let other people know about it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imagine how it would be to be  illegal for you to share a link to a news article without first emailing the newspaper and asking for permission.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this day and age we have enough technological measures to ensure that an organization would be able to deploy in order to protect whatever content it deems it should not be accessible to the whole Internet by mere hyperlinking.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technology evolves faster than laws are being updated and this creates enough problems as it is, having more laws about this is not helpful but to the contrary. 


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user's computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This should be an exception to the copyright laws that apply to all the member states.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rights holders should not be able to have a say about the content temporarily held in memory or in cache while it's being viewed by the user. This would be a door open to abuse by rights holders.
* Download to own digital content 
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article). The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy). This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have "re-sold" it  -  this is often referred to as the "forward and delete" question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YES  -  Please explain by giving examples
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just as I am able to sell a hardcopy book, I should have the option to sell an e-book. Unfortunately, most e-books today contain DRM technologies which take certain rights from the end users such as selling the book after finished reading or making copies of pages from the book for fair use purposes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The same reasoning should apply to any other digital content. If I buy it, I should be able to do whatever I want with it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The right holders should not have a say of how I use the content that I legally buy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The resale of digital content should be treated just as the resale of content available on a media device such as a CD or DVD.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This would create a market where new content would be made available to users who would get the funds to buy it be selling old content to other people (just like selling 2 movie DVDs to get the money to buy a new movie DVD that just came out).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, the sale of the content should be between the two parties involved in the transaction and the rights holders should not be involved in any way.
* Registration of works and other subject matter  -  is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being considered.  
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of works and other subject matter? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What would be the possible advantages of such a system? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In some cases it is very hard to track down the owners of a copyrigthed material which exists, but according to current rules it is not yet in the public domain to ask for rights granting and works of art can remain in limbo due to uncertainties in their legal status regarding copyright.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to see a system where if no claims of copyright by who inherits the author's estate for 1-3 years, the works should automatically fall into public domain.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I do not see any disadvantages to a system like this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Knowing who owns the rights to a certain work would speed up process of finding the author or the right holder and work out a licensing agreement if there is an interest in the work. By "if there is interest" I mean if the work is useful enough that someone might actually want to buy it (as for example not all books are hits).
* How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers, collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed `identifiers'. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are specific to the sector in which they have been developed, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database should, once operational, provide a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition was established to develop building blocks for the expression and management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM)  -  a comprehensive data model for all types of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub is seeking to take such identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across different sectors. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Term of protection  -  is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US). 

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of protection. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NO  -  Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The copyright protection terms are very long and should be shortened to around 15-20 years after a work has been created, regardless of the type.
* Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC. 
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international law. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders. 
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level), these limitations and exceptions are often optional, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market. 
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member State "B"). 
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member States' regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding your example, I would think that having different legislation in each member state would hinder the adoption of a more universal curriculum for students that should be able to use books created in other member states - considering your example.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Textbooks for schools/academia use small portions of other books (for example literature) to study and illustrate concepts and if a student wants to dig deeper in the subject would have to buy the book that the class textbook refers to. And taking this into consideration, rights holders should not need to be compensated for partial reproductions of their books for use in teaching as it's beneficial for them and it does not provide any losses to them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fair use should be more broad.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I do not have specific cases in mind, but a harmonized level of exceptions across the European Union would make things more clearer and would set the same rules for everyone.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although I do not have a specific example in mind, a catalogue of limitations and exceptions should be kept up to date in order to make sure that any time everyone has the ability to know what is permitted or not.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YES  -  Please explain why 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fair use right should be allowed for everyone in the EU. This encourages new creation of content, remixing of existing content to create new original works and so on.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fair use term should be clearly defined and implemented as EU wide law in order to harmonize existing laws within the union.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secondly, I would categorize fair use into two terms:
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For private use, as long as there is no financial gain, the audio content should be modified and used as pleased by the end-user (for example to use already owned music to add as a soundtrack to a vacation movie, wedding album etc)
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For commercial use, no more than 30% of the content length (in total) should be considered fair use of any copyrighted work (audio, video, book etc).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This would ensure that endusers are shielded by frivolous demands by the rights holders and it also encourages commercial use of works to a higher degree.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YES  -  Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content in all forms should be available to everyone, not limited by artificial limits imposed by a rights holder who would decide that a certain work should be available in a member country of the EU. Borders are disappearing, the EU is getting even more integrated. The availability of content should follow this trend. Laws must NOT be put in place to ensure the functioning of existing business models for companies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of "fair compensation" be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who pays who, where: the creator of the mixed content pays the owners of the content. In the example of text books that you used in the previous questions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The book creators are payed by the publishing company; either royalties based on sales figures or a fixed sum.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the books contain full content from some authors (like an entire poem) then there should be an exemption on this content as being for the education of students, the creators of the works benefit from this by making their work known and could also increase sales of their published books when a student would want to know more about the work of an author.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I find it simple and easy as it overcomes all kinds of problems that exist (like a state having to compensate a rights holder for allegedly incurred damages).
* Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and archiving and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject matter in the collections of such institutions. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here. 
* Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films)  -  the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web content) is often uncertain.
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other subject matter in your collection?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I do not recall exactly the places, but some museums would ban photography of their exhibits because they claim if no one photographs their exhibits, more people would come to see them and would increase their sale.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I find this to be wrong as seeing a picture of an exhibit (for example Mona Lisa) is not the same thing as looking at the original in a museum. People go to museums for the experience and to see the exibits with their own eyes, otherwise they just as well search for pictures, videos and information on the Internet.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of the libraries is to gather content so that people can come and do research, lend books and other media. All this benefits all of us greatly by either helping students research for their classes, provide inspiration for others to create more works and so on.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, libraries should be able to preserve content for generations to come.

* Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

* E  -  lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

* Mass digitisation
The term "mass digitisation" is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.  Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing authors and publishers on the other. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting society or the recognition of an "extended effect" to the licences granted). 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

* Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

* Disabilities 
Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and facilitating their distribution across the European Union) . 
The Marrakesh Treaty has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

* Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics are different terms used to describe increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.  
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without restrictions on the internet, open access). 
Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain "access" to content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases). 
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe". In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across borders?

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data mining, in general acceptance means processing vast quantities of data in order to create findings, statistical reports and so on. Considering these aspects, data mining on copyrighted content as long as that content is not reproduced more than what would be considered fair use should be exempt from copyright as an exception.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For example, the approval of the right holder should not be required if I want to mine all the works of an author to look for specific phrases, words of any other information that does not reproduce in full the work(s) protected by the copyright.

Data mining should be exempt from copyright. As with question 53, data mining is an automated process that produces synthesized results from electronically processing content. This type of actions do not create any burden on the rights holders and also do not distribute, view or otherwise do something with the content that might require a licensing agreement.

* User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the making of so-called "user-generated content". While users can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not "new" as such. However, the development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across different sectors as a result of the "Licences for Europe" discussions.

* Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and photocopying. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers' licence fees. 
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that the EU should make clear that making private copies of bought goods under copyright does not cause any damage to the rights holders and levies for this type of possibility should be scraped.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A rights holder should first show what harm has been inflicted upon it by making a private copy of a bought work (audio, video etc) before demanding a levy from a person.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current levy system as I see it today favors too much the rights holders and assumes that everyone that buys a copyrighted work (audio, video etc) only wants to make copies of it and distribute it to other people and so on in order to inflict damage upon the rights holder.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever I buy a song or video online I should be able to make as many copies as I want for my own personal use just like in your example. Making a copy of a song for private use does not create any burden on the rights holder and therefore no levies should be imposed on users.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An arbitrary levy imposition would create grounds for abuse by rights holders and would allow them to assume that every person that buys a song or a video or any other content will make copies of it. This approach would not be not inline with the established legal normal that a person is innocent until proven guilty.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing  allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders' revenue on the other? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fact that a user can synchronize more devices to the same cloud provider actually enabled the rights holders to gain more by making their content very accessible to the end user, thus enabling him/her to access even more content in a very easy way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In recent press articles, it has been demonstrated that rights holders make more money by allowing cloud provider subscribers to listen to whatever they want wherever they want that by doing individual licensing deals (in the United States, the average users is reported to be spending $18 anually on cloud services streamed media versus around less than $14 anually on "hard" media).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As it can probably be seen quite clearly, the simpler the access to the copyrighted material is, the more money spend on it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YES  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to know if a product is subject to a levy and what levy is that for. This would allow me to make a better or more informed decision about buying or not buying a product subject to levies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the other hand, I think blanket levies are unfair for the end user and should be removed from products.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The existence of levies implies the fact that in the eyes of the law all the people that buy blank CDs are buying them to make copies of music or whatever else might be copied.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to see an option to get my money back for blank media used for other purposes than to make copies of copyrighted works. The law should work both ways, not only in favor of a certain group.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the same reasoning for imposing levies on everyone in the name of "protecting the damages suffered by rights holders" I would like the opportunity to be able to be fully refunded after I watch a movie at the cinema which I don't enjoy.
Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments.

* Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from authors or performers to producers or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different sectors of the creative industries. 
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.  Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right now, from my knowledge, there is no transparent method of how everyone in the value chain gets remunerated and it is also no clear way understanding of "not being remunerated enough" means from each stakeholder perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For example, it would be beneficial to everyone involved to have a transparent breakdown on how much money each stakeholder gets when I buy a song/album/video on iTunes or on a similar platform.
* Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this text. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial purpose. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure. At the same time, there could be clarification of the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the copyright infringement for commercial purposes, the law should be clear that whatever the perpetrators (after being found guilty) are liable in damages to the rights holders with all the gains from that activity. For example if someone sells counterfeited DVDs and makes EUR5000 from them and is caught and found guilty, those earnings should go to the rights holders as compensation. If the rights holders want more than that, they should prove that they losses were more with verifiable evidence.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough to allow for  sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Internet service providers should be exempt from any sort of copyright infringement blocking. They cary traffic from one place to another and should not be used as a police force.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secondly, there should be more transparency, accountability and due process when dealing with copyright infringement. As a common practice, rights holders equate an illegal download to a lost sale which I think it's very wrong and biased toward their interest. Just as police has to provide evidence beyond any reasonable doubt to a judge/jury for each accusation towards a person, so should the rights holders be able to justify beyond any doubt that they actually lost a sale because copyrighted infringement was perpetrated by a party with the goal of earning revenue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved between the right to have one's copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NO  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From my perspective, the balance is heavily biased towards the rights holders. The rights holders should provide evidence beyond any reasonable doubt of the losses that they allegedly suffered. Also, this type of issue should be of a civil matter.
* A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States' legal systems. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Considering the fact that now each member country has different ideas about what copyright means and how rights of the holders should be protected, it would be beneficial to have a EU wide directive to cover these aspects. And yes, I would think this is a long term project.
* Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so they can be properly addressed in the future.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all, I think there are some issues with the current copyright system that need to be addressed:
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current copyright law as I see it favors the rights holders by giving them many ways to enforce their claims, while at the same time restricts the rights of the people that buy works that are copyrighted. There must be a balance between how people are remunerated for their creative work and what rights on that work have people that buy it.
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The levy system should be disbanded as it considers from the start that everyone who buys a device that might be able to reproduce or hold digital content is considered an infringer that might possibly create "harm" to the rights holders and therefore they should be compensated even if a person does not infringe on their rights. Or, if for some reason legislators find that rights holders need to make money from every sold CD, DVD, USB memory stick and whatever else might be considered a possible device used for "infringing" on the rights of someone, there should also be put in place a system where a user can be compensated by the rights holders for the lost time watching/listening/reading/etc a crap movie/song/book/etc.
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Digital goods must not equate the same as physical goods when it comes to copying, for the sole reason that if a person makes a copy of a work, the rights holder does not lose the ability to make any more copies for it to sell, rent or license and therefore the damage is not the same. While it's important to mention that it's wrong to copy a video or a song without having the right, equating this to theft in a physical world is also wrong.
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When claiming damages, rights holders must show irrefutable proof that they actually lost what they claim they lost to the last cent.
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While it's a characteristic of a free society that a person should be able to do whatever it want wit the creation of its mind (creative work), it's also important that this right is not abused.
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File-sharing should be legalized and enshrined into law as legal. As with any technology, it can be used for good and bad, but this does not mean we should ban it just because of this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the questions are not very clear from a layman's position (such as cross-border transactions and so on). Having said this, I would pretty much appreciate a consultation which takes this matters and adapts them so that everyone can understand all the terms, legal and otherwise.
