   I. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers62 or determining who the  owner  of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract63. This is an area that has been traditionally left  for
Member  States  to  regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences   in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries. 
Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain. 
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary. 



   1. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?
[Open question]  

A set of different online tarifs (collected by copyright  associations  like
PRS,  GEMA,  SUISA  etc.)  applied  to  content  enablers/providers,   media
websites,  advertising  and  websites  replacing   or   combining   radio/tv
functions should generate enough money to compensate the loss in many  other
areas. 
If this happens the music and film industry will  be  able  to  survive  the
current state of illegal content spreading and  consumption  through  famous
phone, media and other companies.



I.    Respect for rights
   1. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]

Make new rules. Go where the money is being made first and ask yourself  why
is it made. The answer is most probably linked to content which is not  paid
for or distributed free (without payments to copyright associations).







   I. I.    Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.



   1. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.
[Open question]



I personally work in music production  for  films,  advertising  since  many
years.
In regard to this questionnaire I think this document is very  detailed  and
I wouldn't be surprised if many important  people  won't  understand  and/or
have time to read into this. It is way too complicated  for  the  fact  that
there are much bigger problems that need to be solved first.
Anyway I wish you the best of luck and thank  you  for  trying  to  make  an
effort in creating something positive for the creators of europe.
Best regards
