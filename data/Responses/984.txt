I.Introduction

Context of the consultation

Over the last two decades,digital technology and the Internet
have reshaped the ways in which content is created,
distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised
for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a
novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms,
for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as

research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access
content-for information, education or entertainment
purposes-regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is
for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of
distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to
ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and
enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these
challenges: ensuring that theEUcopyright regulatory framework
stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support
creation and innovation, tap the full potential of theSingle
Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote
cultural diversity.

In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single
Market"1the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action:
ontheone hand, to complete its on-going effort to review

23

and to modernisetheEU copyright legislative framework with a
view to a decision in2014on whether to table legislative reform
proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical
industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue
"Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid progress was
deemed necessary and possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The
Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders
haveputforward in this context and will monitor their progress.
Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working
Groups (cross border portability of services, user-generated
content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges
to be a further step in making the user environment easier in
many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups - user-generated content and text and
data mining - did not reach consensus among participating
stakeholders on eithertheproblems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe"
will be also taken into account in the context of the review
ofthelegislative framework.

As part of the review process,the Commission is now launching a
public consultation on issues identified in the Communication
on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:"territoriality
in the Internal Market,harmonisation,limitations and exceptions
to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of theEUcopyright
market; and how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
enforcement while underpinning its legitimacyin the wider
context of copyright reform".As highlighted in the
October2013European

Council Conclusions5"Providing digital services and content
across the single market requires the establishment of a
copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will
therefore complete its on-going review of theEUcopyright
framework in spring2014.It is important tomodernise Europe's
copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a
high level protection of intellectual property rights and
taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public
hearings, in particular those

on the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the
"Green Paper on the

78 online distribution of audiovisual works" and "Content
Online".These consultations

provided valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of
questions, on issues as

diverse as the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to
overcome territoriality,

exceptions related to the online dissemination of knowledge, and
rightholders'

remuneration, particularly in the audiovisual sector. Views were
expressed by

stakeholders representing all stages in the value chain,
including right holders,

distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on

the best way to proceed. The"Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy"

was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green
Paper on the online

distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent
discussions on the Collective

Rights Management Directiveand into the current review process.

I.Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why is it not possible to access many online content services
from anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital
transmissions and the segmentation of the market through
licensing agreements]

Holders of copyright and related rights-e.g. writers, singers,
musicians-do not enjoy a single protection in theEU.Instead,
they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights
in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised
by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and
the geographical scope oftherights is limited to the territory
of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus
territorial inthesense that rights are acquired and enforced on
a country-by-country basis

9

under national law .

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the
Internet-e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online
e-book seller-therefore requires, in principle, an

authorisation for each national territory in which the content
is communicated to thepublic.Rightholders are, of course, in a
position to grant a multi-territorial or pan- European licence,
such that content services can be provided in several Member
States and across borders. A number of steps have been taken
atEUlevel to facilitatemulti­territoriallicences: the proposal
for a Directive on Collective Rights Management10should
significantly facilitatethedelivery of multi-territorial
licences in musical works

11  12

for online services;the structured stakeholder dialogue
"Licences for Europe" and

13

market-led developments such astheon-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition .

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue
of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers
having subscribed to online services in their Member State
tokeep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other
Member States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual
sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to
continue working towards the further development of

cross-border portability14.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the
cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These
problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access
services that are made available in Member States other than
the one in which they live. Not all online services are
available in all Member States and consumers face problems when
trying to access such services across borders. In some
instances, even ifthe"same" service is available in all Member
States, consumers cannot access the service across borders
(they can only access their "national" service, and if they try
to access the "same" service in another Member State they are
redirected to the one designated for their country of
residence).

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of
rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights
in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing
agreements between right holders and distributors and/or
between distributors and end usersmay also be at the origin of
some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further
measures (legislative ornon­legislative,including market-led
solutions) need to be taken at EU level inthemedium

term15to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level
of protection for right holders.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what
needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]

TheEUframework for the protection of copyright and related
rights in the digital

environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16on
theharmonisationof certain aspects of copyright and related
rights in the information society. OtherEUdirectives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those
relating to the

protection of software17and databases18.

Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and
neighbouring rightholders

which are essential for thetransmission of digital copies of
works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g.
a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.

The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the
reproduction right, i.e.the right

20

to authorise or prohibitthemaking of copies , (notably relevant
at the start ofthetransmission-e.g. the uploading of a digital
copy of a work to a server in view of making it available-and
at the users' end-e.g. when a user downloadsa digital copy of a
work) and the communication to the public/making available
right, i.e. the rights to

21

authorise or prohibitthedissemination of the works in digital
networks . These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and bothneed to be cleared.

The act of "making available"

Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neitherwhatis covered by the
making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by
the public, the actual reception by the public) norwheretheact
of "making available" takes place. This does not raise
questions if the act is limited to a single territory.
Questions arise however when the transmission covers several
territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of
"making available" happen in the country of the upload only? in
each of the countries where the content is potentially
accessible? in each of the countries where the content is
effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court
of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)suggests that a relevant
criterion is the "targeting" of a certain Member State's 22

public . According to this approachthecopyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries
which are "targeted" by the online service provider. A service
provider "targets" a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via
advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency
specifically targeted at that group.

1.Is the scope of the "making available"right in cross-border
situations— i.e.when content is disseminated across
borders—sufficiently clear?

!YES

!NO-Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of
clarification would be required (e.g.as in "targeting" approach
explained above, as in "country of origin" 23

approach )

!NO OPINION

1.[In particular if you are a right holder:]Could a
clarification of the territorial scope of the "making
available"right have an effect on the recognitionof your rights
(e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether
you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on
your remuneration, or on

the enforcement of rights (including the availability of
injunctivereließ4)?!YES-Please explain how such potential
effects could be addressed

! NO

!NO OPINION

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the
current state of technology and law) several reproductions.
This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available
right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online
use notably whenthe two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

1.[Inparticular if you a service provider or a right
holder:]Does the application of two rights to a single act of
economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
download) create problemsfor you?

order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint
licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to
achieve the "bundling of rights")

Linkingand browsing

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one
location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for
the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several

25

cases are pending beforetheCJEU in which the questionhas been
raised whethertheprovision of a clickable link constitutes an
act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly
creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in

26

the 'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been referred
totheCJEU as to whether such copies are always covered by the
mandatory exceptionfor temporary acts of reproduction provided
for in Article5(1)of Directive 2001/29/EC.

1.Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other
subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or
under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the rightholder?

0YES-Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in
general, or under specific circumstances, and why

0NO-Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in

Download to own digital content

Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital
transmission (e.g. download to own). Questionsarise as to the
possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this
manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The
principle ofEUexhaustion of the distribution right applies in
the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a
tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the
right holder cannot

27

prevent the further distribution of that tangible article).The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be
applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent

28

in its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the
property of the copy).This raises difficult questions,notably
relating to the practical application of such an approach (how
to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after
they have "re-sold" it-this is often referred to as the
"forward and delete" question) as well as to the economic
implications of the creation of a second-hand market of copies
of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

[Open question]

Registration of works and other subject matter-is it a good
idea?

Registration is not often discussed in copyright in theEUas the
existing international treaties in the area prohibit
formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of

29

rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute.Moreover a
system ofregistration does not need to be made compulsory or
constitute a precondition fortheprotection and exercise of
rights. With a longer term of protection and with the increased
opportunities that digital technology provides for the use of
content (including older works and works that otherwise would
not have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages
of a

30

system of registration are increasingly being considered .

the identification and licensing of works and other subject
matter?

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

There are many private databasesof works and other subject
matter held by producers, collective management organisations,
and institutions such as libraries, which are based to a
greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less)
interoperable, internationally agreed 'identifiers'.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a

31

work, are specific to the sector in which they have been
developed,and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner
or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are
notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to
improve the

32

interoperability of such identifiers and databases. The Global
Repertoire Database should, once operational, provide a single
source of information ontheownership and

33

control of musical works worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition
was established to

develop building blocks for the expression and management of
rights and licensing across all content and media types. It
includes the development of a Rights Reference Model
(RRM)-acomprehensive data model for all types of rights in all
types of content. The 34

UK Copyright Hub is seeking to take such identification systems
a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling
automated licensing across different sectors.

1.What should be the role of theEUin promoting the adoption of
identifiers inthecontent sector,andin
promotingthedevelopmentandinteroperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?

[Open question]

Term of protection-is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for
a limited period of time. After the term of protection has
expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national
rules on moral rights).

35

The Berne Convention requires a minimum term of protection
of50years after the death of the author. TheEUrules extend this
term of protection to70years after the death of the author (as
do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers inthemusic sector and phonogram
producers,theterm provided for in the EU rules also extend 20
years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of70years after the first
publication. Performers and producers intheaudio-visual sector,
however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

in the digital environment?

I.Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

Limitations and exceptionsto copyright and related rights enable
the use of works and other protected subject-matter, without
obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for
illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher
in a literature class). AtEUlevel they are established

36

in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive
2001/29/EC.

Exceptions and limitations inthenational and EU copyright laws
have to respect37

international law . In accordance with international
obligations,theEU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which
do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other
subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate
interest oftherightholders.

Whereasthecatalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU
law is exhaustive (no

38

other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised
atEUlevel),these limitations

39

and exceptions are often optional,in the sense that Member
States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or
as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of
certain of the limitations and exceptions is general enough to
give significant flexibility to the Member States as to how,
and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do
so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the
limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms
and in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of
the Single Market.

In addition, in the same mannerthat the definition of the rights
is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the territory of
the Member State), the definition of the limitations and
exceptions totherights is territorial too (so an act that is
covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may still require
the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to

the Member State "B")40

The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also
raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In
some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or
exception to

their rights. In other instances Member States are not obliged,
but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If a
limitation or exception triggering amechanism of fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the
books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a
Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify
which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being
raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that theEUand
Member States' regulatory frameworksadapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an
exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation
of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in theEUand
Member States regulatory framework while ensuringtherequired
legal certainty, including forthefunctioning of the Single
Market, and respecting theEU'sinternational obligations.

Accesstocontentin libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their
national law a range of limitations and exceptions
forthebenefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. Ifimplemented,
these exceptions allow

41

acts of preservation and archiving and enable on-site
consultation of the works and

42

other subject matter in the collections of such institutions.The
public lending (under anexception or limitation) by these
establishments of physical copies of works and other

43

subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive.

Questions arise as to whetherthe current framework continues to
achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be
clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the
same time, questions arise as totheeffect of such a possible
expansion onthenormal exploitationof works and other subject
matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders.
The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between
different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving

The preservation ofthecopies of works or other subject-matter
held inthecollections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,
records, or films)-the restoration or replacement of works, the
copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another
copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most Member
States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing
for the making of such preservation copies. The scope
oftheexception differs from Member State to Member State (as
regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of
works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of
copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary
establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of new
types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving
publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation
of works and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book,
watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises
of such establishments for the purpose of research and private
study. The online consultation of works and other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises ofthelibrary) requires authorisation and is
generally addressed in agreements between
universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law
rather than agreements should provide forthepossibilityto,and
the conditions for, granting

online access to collections.

E-lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of
works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users.
Recent technological developments have made it technically
possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access
to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via
networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such
e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and
libraries are currently experimenting with different business
models for the making available of works online, including
direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling
by aggregators.

Mass digitisation

The term "mass digitisation" is normally used to refer to
efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to
digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their
collections with an objective to preserve these collections
and, normally, to makethem available to the public. Examples
are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part
ofthe

20thcentury or whole collections of pictures of historical
value. This matter has been partly addressed at theEUlevel by
the2011Memorandum ofUnderstanding (MoU) on key principles on
the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works
(i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of
commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of
licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural
institutions on the one hand and

the collecting societies representing authors and publishers on
the other.Provided therequired funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should
be that books that are currently to be found only in the
archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary
licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on the
basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers).
Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the
largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing
in legislation apresumption of representation of a collecting
society or the

45

recognition of an "extended effect" to the licences granted).

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their
national legislation limitations and exceptions forthepurpose of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would
typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to
illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments
of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by
showing protected content on a smart board without having to
obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather
different implementation at Member States level. The
implementation of the exception differs from Member State to
Member State, with several Member States providing instead a
framework for the licensing of content for certain educational
uses. Some argue that the law should provide for better
possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

Directive 2001/29/EC providesforanexception/limitation for the

level projects have been launched to increase the accessibility
of works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities
(notably by increasing the number of works published in special

49

formats and facilitating their distribution across the European
Union) .

The Marrakesh Treaty50has been adopted to facilitateaccess to
published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired,
or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind
to produce, distribute and make available accessible
formatcopies to visually impaired persons without the
authorisation of the rightholders. TheEUand its Member States
have started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may
require the adoption of certain provisions atEUlevel (e.g. to
ensure the possibilityto exchange accessible format copies
across borders).

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51are
different terms used todescribe increasingly important
techniques used in particular by researchers fortheexploration
of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web
sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or other
automated processes, an analysisis made of relevant texts and
data in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible
on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g.
journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g.
on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto
the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis.
Normally, it is considered that to mine protectedworks or other
subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the
right holders for the making of such copies unless such
authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to
general public without restrictions ontheinternet, open
access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are
covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article5.1of
Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining
activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright.None
of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does
not consist only of a single method,butcan be undertaken in
several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue
gobeyond copyright (i.e.

beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use
content) and relate rather tothe need to obtain "access" to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time,
practical solutions to facilitate text and data miningof
subscription-based scientific

52

content were presented by publishers as an outcome of "Licences
for Europe" . In the context of these discussions, other
stakeholders argued that no additionallicences should be
required to mine material to which access has been provided
through a subscription agreement and considered that a specific
exception for text and data mining should be introduced,
possibly onthebasis of a distinction between commercial
andnon­commercial.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can
copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial
cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called
"user-generated content". While users can create totally
original content, they can also take one or several
pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload
the result on the Internet e.g. to53

platforms andblogs.User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover
the modification of

pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work
does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from
merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing
content with other pre-existing content. This kindof activity
is not "new" as such. However, the development of social
networking and social media sites that enable users to share
content widely has vastly changedthescale of such activities
and increased the potential economic impact for those
holdingrights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer
the preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite.
With the possibilities offered bythenew technologies, re-use is
open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with
regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and
the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on
eithertheproblems to be addressed ortheresults or even the
definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were
presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One
view wasto say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in
particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as
combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of
photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is
needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between
rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded
between rightholders andtheusers generatingthecontent. In any
event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content and
facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by
rightholders across different sectors as a result
ofthe"Licences for

Europe" discussions54.

I.Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their
national legislation exceptions or limitations to the
reproduction right for copies made for private use and

photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on
goods typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording
equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such
as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made
without their authorisation by certain categories of persons
(i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or
through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that
context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the
question arises as to whether the copying of files by
consumers/end-users who have purchased content online-e.g. when
a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple
copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile
phone)-also triggers, or should trigger,the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these
levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the
licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to
instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on
top of service

providers' licence fees5657.

There is also an on-going discussion as totheapplication or not
of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as
personal lockers or personal video recorders.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply
different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free
circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the
same time, many Member States continue to allow the
indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all
transactions irrespective of the person to whomtheproduct
subject to a levy issold (e.g. private person or business). In
that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption
and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could

remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue
payments61.

I.Fair remuneration of authors and performers

TheEUcopyright acquis recognises for authors and performersa
number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose
performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There
are few provisions in theEUcopyright law governing the

transferof rights from authors or performers to producers or
determining whotheowner of the rights is when the work or other
subject matter is created in the context of an63

employment contract.This is an area that has been traditionally
left for Member States

to regulate and there are significant differences in regulatory
approaches. Substantial differences also exist between
different sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are
not adequately remunerated,in particularbutnot solely, as
regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared
along the whole value chain. Another commonly raised issue
concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses andthelack
of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of
the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action atEUlevelis necessary.

I.Respect for rights

64

Directive 2004/48/EE provides for a harmonised framework for the
civil enforcement of intellectual property rights, including
copyright and related rights. The Commission

has consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised
as to whether some of its provisions are still fit to ensure a
proper respect for copyright inthedigital age. Ontheone
hand,thecurrent measures seem to be insufficientto deal
withthenew challenges brought by the dissemination of digital
content ontheinternet; ontheother hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright
andtheprotection of fundamental rights, in particular the right
for a private life and data protection. While it cannot be
contested that enforcement measures should always be available
in case of infringement of copyright, measures could be
proposed to strengthen

respect for copyright when the infringed content isused for a
commercial purpose66. One

67

means to do this could be to clarify the role of intermediaries
intheIP infrastructure . At thesame time, there could be
clarification of the safeguards for respect of private life and
data protection for private users.

The idea of establishing a unifiedEUCopyright Title has been
presentin the copyright debate for quite some time now,
although views as to the merits andthefeasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unifiedEUCopyright Title would totally
harmonise the area of copyright law in theEUand replace national
laws. There would then be a singleEUtitle instead of a bundle of
national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a
truly Single Market for content protected by copyright can be
ensured, while others

believe that the same objective can better be achievedby
establishing a higher level ofharmonisationwhile allowing for a
certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States'
legal systems.
