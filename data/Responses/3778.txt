Introduction

Contextof the consultation

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet
have reshaped the ways in which content is created,
distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised
for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, anovel,
a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for
institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research
and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –
for information, education or entertainment purposes –
regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is
for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of
distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to
ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and
enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these
challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework
stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support
creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single
Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote
cultural diversity.

In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1

COM (2012)789 final, 18/12/2012.

the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action:on the one
hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework2

As announced in the Intellectual Property Strategy ' A single
market for Intellectual Property Rights: COM (2011)287 final,
24/05/2011.

"Based on market studies and impact assessment and legal
drafting work"as announced in the Communication (2012)789.

with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table
legislative reform proposals, andon the other, to facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder
dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4

See the document “Licences for Europe – tem pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

. The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders
have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four
Working Groups (cross border portability of services,
user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these
pledges to be a further step in making the user environment
easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes
note of the fact that two groups – user-generated content and
text and data mining – did not reach consensus among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be
addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of
"Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in the
context of the review of the legislative framework.

As part of the review process, theCommission is now launching a
public consultation on issues identified in the Communication
on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:"territoriality
in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and
exceptions to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of
the EU copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness
and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy
in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the
October 2013 European CouncilConclusions5

EUCO169/13, 24/25 October 2013.

"Providing digital services and content across the single market
requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the digital
age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review
of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important
to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of
intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural
diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public
hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright
in the knowledge economy"6

COM(2008)
466/3,http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/copyright-infso/index_en.htm#maincontentSec2.

, the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual
works"7

COM(2011) 427
final,http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2011/audiovisual_en.htm.

and "Content Online"8

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2009/content_online_en.htm.

. These consultations provided valuable feedback from
stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as
the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome
territoriality, exceptions related to the online
disseminationof knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration,
particularly in the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by
stakeholders representing all stages in the value chain,
including right holders, distributors, consumers, and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the
best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The
replies to the "Green Paper on the online distribution of
audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current
review process.

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why isit not possible to access many online content services
from anywhere in Europe?[The territorial scope of the rights
involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the
market through licensing agreements]

Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers,
musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,
they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights
in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised
by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and
the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the
territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced
on a country-by-country basis under national law9

This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on
several occasions.

.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet
– e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online e-book
seller – therefore requires, in principle, anauthorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to
the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant
a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across
borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to
facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a
Directive on Collective Rights Management10

Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 11 July2012 on collective management of copyright
and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in
musical works for online uses in the internal market, COM(2012)
372 final.

should significantly facilitate the delivery of
multi-territorial licences in musical works for online
services11

Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in
the management of online rights for musical works in contrast
to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by
right holders such as filmor record producers or by newspaper
or book publishers.

; the structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences for Europe”12

You can find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/.

and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13

You can find more information on the following
website:http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org/.

.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue
of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers
having subscribed to online services in their Member State to
keep accessing them when travelling temporarilyto other Member
States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector
issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue
working towards the further development of cross-border
portability14

See the document “Licences for Europe – tem pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the
cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These
problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access
services that are made available in Member States other than
the one in which they live. Not all online services are
available in all Member States and consumers face problems when
trying to access such services across borders. In some
instances, even if the “same” service is available in all
Member States, consumers cannot access the service across
borders (they can only access their “national” service, and if
they try to access the "same" service in another Member State
they are redirected to the one designated for their country of
residence).

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of
rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights
in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing
agreements between right holders and distributors and/or
between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of
some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further
measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15

For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a
European Copyright Code (establishing a single title) see
section VII of this consultation document.

to increase the cross-border availability of content services in
the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
protection for right holders.

[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you faced
problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member
State other than the one in which you live?

YES- Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the
sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content
suchas certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in
general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers,
games, applications and other software)

My family is german but we live in France since over 30 years.
The kids look at films of the famousgerman TV-show “Die Sendung
mit der Maus”. Many of those shows are not available outside
Germany. I assume the license is either “Germany” or
“worldwide” and that “worldwide” is too expensive. Kids
frustration was such that I installed a socks proxy via aGerman
host. Those things are ineffective and very annoying and hinder
the making of the single market and the creation of a single EU
public information space.

Second example: When Edward Snowden was interviewed by German
television, Europe had a greatinterest to watch that interview.
But it was only available for people with an IP address that was
recognised to be German (but which may have been used from
anywhere).

Third example: Many people in Europe really like the BBC. They
often have very nice documentary shows and also famous TV
shows. Nobody can access those from the continent as they
require a British IP to be present. While it worked in the
early days of the Web, recent developments have shown an
increase in those blockings. So instead of making the single
information market, we move to ever more segregation.

In short: it is getting worse instead of getting better. This is
why I believe, legal action is required to achieve the single
market.

[In particular if you are a service provider:]Have you faced
problems when seeking to provide online services across borders
in the EU?

 YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your
experience, are related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.
business decisions relating to the cost of providingservices
across borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer
protection)? Please provide examples indicating the Member
State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g.
premium content such as certain films and TV series,
audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other
software).

[In particular if you are a right holder or acollective

If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the

Do not allow nationallicenses. Only allow EU-wide licenses.
Nobody in the US would tolerate a “California only license”.
Declare limitations with finer granularity than EU member
states to be void or abusive

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

[In particular if you are aright holder or a collective
management organisation:]Are there reasons why, even in cases
where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories
in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions on aservice provider (in order,
for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not
possible in certain European countries)?

[In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service

impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in
order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different
website than the one he is trying to access)?

 YES – Please explain by giving examples

Whenever I asked, it was either explained by outrageous pricing
or by cluelessness and business as usual. Very often, the
licensing is either national (France) or global (world!).
Thelicensing consultants and legal firms don't do their job.
They just use the same contract templates from the past
century.

extend to the entire EU and that limitations below EU level are
void.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what
needs to be authorised (or not) in digital
transmissions?[Thedefinition of the rights involved in digital
transmissions]

The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related
rights in the digital environment is largely established by
Directive 2001/29/EC16

Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament andof the
Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects
of copyright and related rights in the information society.

on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related
rights in the information society. OtherEU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those
relating to the protection of software17

Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer
programs.

and databases18

Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.

.

Directive 2001/29/ECharmonises the rights of authors and
neighbouring rightholders19

Film and record producers, performers andbroadcasters are
holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in, respectively,
their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’
content protected by copyright is referred to as a “work” or
“works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights
isreferred to as “other subject matter”.

which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of
works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g.
a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.

The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the
reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the
making of copies20

The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect,
temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any
form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC)
although temporary acts of reproduction of a transient or
incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see
art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).

, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the
uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of
making it available – and at the users’ end – e.g. when a user
downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to
the public/making available right, i.e. the rights toauthorise
or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital
networks21

The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the
public by wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit
the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3of
Directive 2001/29/EC).

. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions
and both need to be cleared.

The act of “making available”

Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neitherwhatis covered by the
making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by
the public, the actual reception by the public) norwherethe act
of “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions
if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise
however when the transmission covers severalterritories and
rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available"
happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the
countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each
of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?).
The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the
European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the
“targeting” of a certain Member State's public22

See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar)
and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related rights, and
Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to
jurisdiction see also joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09
(Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez
Hejduk); see however, adopting adifferent approach, Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which
are “targeted” by the online service provider. A service
provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via
advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency
specifically targeted at that group.

Is the scope of the “making available” right incross-border
situations – i.e. when content is disseminated across borders –
sufficiently clear?

 YES

NO– Please explain how this could be clarified and what type
of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"
approach explained above, asin "country of origin" approach23

The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is
to localise the copyright relevant act that must be licenced in
a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be
for example the Member Statein which the content is uploaded or
where the service provider is established), regardless of in how
many Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an
approach has already been introduced at EU level with regard to
broadcasting by satellite(see Directive 93/83/EEC on the
coordination of certain rules concerning copyright and rights
related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and
cable retransmission).

)

The making available in the english language on the web is now
the normal every day use case. This requiresalwaysthe
acquisition of global rights which is too expensive to happen.
Result? Nothing is published. The initial goal of copyright is
turned into its contrary. Instead, there should be a making
available of Web that doesnot equal to “global”. This can be
done with having categories for “print”,
“streaming/television”, “web” and “all”.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you are a right holder:]Could a clarification
of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have
an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you
are considered to be an author or not, whether you are
considered to have transferred your rights or not), onyour
remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
availability of injunctive relief24

Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing
the right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her
right.

)?

YES– Please explain how such potential effects could be
addressed

I guess the hope is to collect 28 times some fee is more than 1
time a bigger fee. And then they end up collecting one time
some smaller fee.

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the
current state of technology and law) several reproductions.
This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available
right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online
use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

[In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:]Does
the application oftwo rights to a single act of economic
exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create
problems for you?

YES– Please explain what type of measures would be needed in
order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint
licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to
achieve the "bundling of rights")

At the workshop on DRM that I held for W3C in 2001, people were
less concerned about the download, but about the re-publication
of their works. So while download is acopy, the republication
and the distinction between commercial/non-commercial
re-publication has gained high importance

Linking and browsing

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one
location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for
the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25

Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International)
and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).

in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the
public/making available to the public subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewinga web-page) regularly
creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the
CJEU26

Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd).
See
alsohttp://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.

as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory
exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in
Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other
subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or
under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the rightholder?

 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the
case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

NO– Please explain whether you consider this to be the case
in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g.
because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by
a copyright exception)

Never ever prohibit linking. Rights on linking will kill the
Web. The fact of linking to a work is freedom to talk about the
object. If we take into account the semantic web, in the future,
we will need URIs to describe an object on the Web. Allowing a
rightsholder to decide on links means the rightsholder gets a
monopoly on the objects we can talk about. This brutally
collides with even the basics of free speech that are required
in a democratic society.So limits on linking are not even a
nuisance only, they are outright dangerous for our democratic
society. This is different from the text that is used in the
linking. This text can meet legal limits (like insult, crime
encouragement etc), but the link should NOT.

 NO OPINION

Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the
temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory
of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?

YES– Please explain whether you consider this to be the case
in general, or under specific circumstances, and why

The web is not television.Once, a user has downloaded content,
once it is on a web page, it can be stored locally. People
often then re-use content for their archives and to talk about
it with their friends. So allowing content to be viewed on a
web page is allowing people to reproduce it on their computer
and possibly discussing it with friends (private copy/fair
use). Having a special web page right outside copyright is
counter productive, because it is less temporary than people
who suggest that temporary right may believe.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case
in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g.
because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

Download to own digital content

Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital
transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the
possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this
manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The
principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in
the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a
tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,the right
holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible
article)27

See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.

. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also
be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in
its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the
property of the copy)28

In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an
author cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence that
allows downloading his computer program from his website and
using it for an unlimited period of time. The exclusive right
of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such
a licence is exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus
admitted that the distribution right may be subject to
exhaustion in case of computer programs offered for download
with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer
Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule
constituted alex specialisin relation to the Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

. This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the
practical application of such an approach (how to avoid
re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a workafter they have
“re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the “forward and
delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of
the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect
quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand
market for physical goods).

[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you faced
restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have
purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

YES– Please explain by giving examples

Even though I triedto carefully avoid lock-in situations, I had
a file that was tied to my computer and that I could not
resell.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]
What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework
enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content?
Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.

[Open question]

Would the European Union be ready to prohibit the selling of
used cars by their owners? Try it and face the public outcry.
So why shouldn't it be possible to resell music files? The
problem here is one of evidence. It is very easy to duplicate
digital content and to sell only thecopy. It must be made clear
that in this case, the initial owner who has kept a copy, is the
one with the illegal copy.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good
idea?

Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as
the existing international treaties in the area prohibit
formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of
rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute29

For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works
originating in the country imposing theformalities as opposed
to works originating in another country.

. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and
exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with
the increased opportunities that digital technology provides
for the use of content (including older works and works that
otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and
disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being
considered30

On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on
certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible
online database is currently being set up by the Office for
Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the
registration of orphan works.

.

Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in
the identification and licensing of works and other subject
matter?

 YES

NO

 NO OPINION

What would be thepossible advantages of such a system?

[Open question]

Nice joke. It would be a nice DDOS on the EU Commission services

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

[Open question]

During the discussionon illegal and harmful content in 2001,
Bertelsmann suggested an observatory. The response from W3C
was: We have currently (2001) 600Mio web pages and we expect 4
billion by 2007. Do you want to register them all? This is
falling back into the 19thcentury. Registrations are a nice
commercial service, but registration should be totally distinct
from rights. Registrations may be privileged in terms of
evidence appreciation, but should not in any way be a
precondition.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

What incentives for registration by rightholders could be
envisaged?

[Open question]

There is a commercial reason to register a work with an online
notary to determine priority and to have a meta-identifier that
allows to determine whether two online instanciations are the
same object. There are already multiple commercial services out
there. They are paid, so rightsholders only use them for very
valuable content.

Note that every web server can act as a registration as it
generates a URI that can be used as the registration key.
Again, an EU registry is a really really bad idea.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

There are many private databases of works and other subject
matter held byproducers, collective management organisations,
and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less)
interoperable, internationally agreed ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a
work, are specific to the sector in which they have been
developed31

E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number
(ISBN) is used to identify books.

, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the
contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are
notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to
improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases.
The Global RepertoireDatabase32

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:http://www.globalrepertoiredatabase.com/.

should, once operational, provide a single source of information
on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33

You will find more information about this initiative (funded in
part by the European Commission) on the following website:
www.linkedcontentcoalition.org.

was established to develop building blocks for the expression
and management of rights and licensing across all content and
media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference
Model (RRM) – acomprehensive data model for all types of rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:http://www.copyrighthub.co.uk/.

is seeking to take such identification systems a step further,
and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing
across different sectors.

What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption
of identifiers in the content sector, andin promoting the
development and interoperability of rights ownership and
permissions databases?

[Open question]

Use ODRL and Creative commons. Those are the most used
languages. Again, this is part of the commercial work done in
notaries. The EU should not kill their business. The EC is
already doing much with Joinup and SEMIC and CAMSS. The EC
should continue that route and not do computer/software design
by law.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works andother subject matter are protected under copyright for
a limited period of time. After the term of protection has
expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national
rules on moral rights). The BerneConvention35

Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works,http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.

requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the
death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of
protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram
producers, the term provided for in the EUrules also extend 20
years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first
publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual
sector, however, do not benefit from such an extendedterm of
protection.

Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate
in the digital environment?

 YES – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

NO– Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

The long term copyright just hinders innovation and
procrustinates the industry. One of the very good things about
digital content is that one can re-use it easily. This allows
us to create new works of many hundreds or even thousands of
man/years as an accumulation of works over time. A long
protection kills that option and just serves the incumbants,
not the authors. Why should the heritage of an author benefit?
What is the justification for the longer period? It is the fact
that rights holders commercial treat copyrights as property. But
it isn t property as it changes after a certain time. So
extending the protection periods is just masking the conflict
until mickey mouse is expired again.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights
enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter,
without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for
certain purposes and to acertain extent (for instance the use
for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a
teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are
established in a number of copyright directives, most notably
Directive 2001/29/EC36

Plus Directive 96/9/ECon the legal protection of
databases;Directive 2009/24/ECon the legal protection of
computer programs,and Directive 92/100/ECon rental right and
lending right.

.

Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws
have to respect international law37

Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of the TRIPS
Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994;
Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty
(1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis
requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in
certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the
rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in
EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the
rights harmonisedat EU level)38

Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor
importance for analogue uses existing in Member States at the
time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

, these limitations and exceptions are often optional39

With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer
Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii)
Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan
Works Directive.

, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in
national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish.
Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and
exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to
the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement
them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting
that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the
EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance
in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the
functioning of the Single Market.

In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the
rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the
territory of the Member State), the definition of the
limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so
anact that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may
still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move
to the Member State "B")40

Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works
Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and related
rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or
cannot be located) has been given a cross-border effect, which
means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a
novel – is considered an orphan work in a Member State,that same
novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States
and can be used and accessed in all Member States.

.

The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also
raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In
some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or
exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are
not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the
books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a
Member State "B") then there wouldalso be a need to clarify
which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being
raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and
Member States’regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an
exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation
of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and
Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required
legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single
Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations
and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are
optional for the Member States?

YES– Please explain by referring to specific cases

This creates a lot of confusion for the single market if in one
member state, the work can be re-distributed for discussion and
in another it can't. Because the network connects the EU to a
single market and people will send stuff to each other. In this
case, this may be permitted or not permitted. One copies a thing
for discussion in France and sends it to his German friendand
the German friend faces fines. How would you make that
understand to the European population that they can't talk to
each other about the same things?

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

Should some/all of the exceptionsbe made mandatory and, if so,
is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such
exceptions?

YES– Please explain by referring to specific cases

See justification above. If European talk to each other by
pointing or sending around pictures ortext, they should have
the expectation that this is all the same all over the EU.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

Should any newlimitations and exceptions be added to or removed
from the existing catalogue?Please explain by referring to
specific cases.

[Open question]

The use case mentioned is discussion. This needs citations
(links) and also copying of some content. The non-commercial
use of works must be privileged. If revenue is generated,
nobody is against sharing/redistribution of that revenue. If no
revenue is generated, people have to be protected against a new
business model that sends protected work into sharing networks
and then rely on legal enforcement to make more money than by
selling. This includes afreewarning before any enforcement
action

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

Independently from the questions above, is there a need to
provide for a greater degreeof flexibility in the EU regulatory
framework for limitations and exceptions?

YES– Please explain why

We don't know yet what new technology is developed. The author
acquires automatically a new exclusive right to all new
distribution channels. But if there is a new way of sharing,
the end-users don't get a new right. So we need flexibility to
adapt and to avoid criminalisation of large portions of the
population. Don't criminalise the school yards again like it
had been done in some member states for the music controversy
created by the advent of the combination of mp3 and the web.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain why

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

If yes, what wouldbe the best approach to provide for
flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the
ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by
the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a
fair-use or fair dealing provision /open norm, etc.)? Please
explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible
effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]

Use a general clause like 'fair use' in US law additionally and
give the authority over the exception to the ECJ. This has
worked to counter abuse of general conditions, it will work
here too. So a stable set of exceptions should be combined with
a general clause of fair and non-commercial use

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your
experience, constitute a problem?

YES– Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are
referring to

See above. Just take the use case of a German and a French
talking about the same thing and exchanging snippets. At the
beginning of the questionnaire reported the limitations if the
kids just want their pairs to look at a video to talk about it.
It is a pressing problem for all EU citizens that moved from
their country of origin to another EU country.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are
referring to

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

In the event that limitations and exceptions established at
national level were to have cross-border effect, how should the
question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such
compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom,
where?)

[Open question]

Cross border effects should only happen with countries outside
the EU

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their
national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the
benefit of publicly accessible libraries,
educationalestablishments and museums, as well as archives. If
implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and
archiving41

Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.

and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42

Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.

. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these
establishments of physical copies of works and other subject
matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43

Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.

.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to
achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be
clarified or updated to coveruse in digital networks. At the
same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible
expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject
matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders.
The role of licensing and possibleframework agreements between
different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving

The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter
held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,
records, orfilms) – the restoration or replacement of works, the
copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another
copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most Member
States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing
for the makingof such preservation copies. The scope of the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards
the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of
works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of
copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary
establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of new
types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving
publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

(a)[In particular if you are an institutional user:]Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use an exception
to preserve and archive specific works or other subject matter
in your collection?

(b)[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you
experienced problems with the use by libraries, educational
establishments, museum or archives of the preservation
exception?

YES– Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of
use in question.

In the Workshop mentioned, we talked about DRM and archiving.
The libraries need a rightto hack to preserve protected content
or we will lose part of our culture because of short sighted
protection mechanisms.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO

 NO OPINION

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

Givelibraries a total freedom on what they do inside the library
and be only strict on what they give out. Libraries need the
right to hack to preserve digital content over long
time.Libraries need a way to make Europes cultural richness
available online without facing prohibitive financial claims.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what
would be its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary
institutions should be covered and under whichconditions?

[Open question]

Give them a right to hack all and everything, but force them to
keep it inside and only distribute once it is not in commerce
anymore.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

If your view is that a different solution is needed,what would
it be?

[Open question]

Libraries should be able to require an unprotectedcopy of every
digital work for free. There is no cost to it as digital
content can be copied with zero cost. And it will preserve our
cultural inheritage. And it will make the Libraries again the
places where one can find relevant stuff and not only stuffthe
libraries can afford for the moment. Which is in itself a
question of power in a democratic society if we take the
paradigm 'knowledge is power' for granted.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation
of works and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book,
watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises
of such establishments for the purpose of research and private
study. The online consultation of works and other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is
generally addressed in agreements between
universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the
lawrather than agreements should provide for the possibility
to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.

(a)[In particular if you are an institutional user:]Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate
agreementswith rights holders that enable you to provide remote
access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts
thereof) for purposes of research and private study?

(b)[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you
experienced specificproblems when trying to consult, including
across borders, works and other subject-matter held in the
collections of institutions such as universities and national
libraries when you are not on the premises of the institutions
in question?

(c)[In particular if you are aright holder:]Have you negotiated
agreements with institutional users that enable those
institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their
collections, for purposes of research and private study?

[Open question]

You should take the following into account: When doing my Ph.D.
I was at the University Library. Everything was perfect and I
was able to access all works that I needed, but this was only
true for works before 1972. In 1972, the law changed and
editors did not have to deliver one copy of a book anymore and
the library had to pay. Starting 1972, only those books were
left that the librarian considered important. And those were of
course NOT the ones I considered important. Then I was re-routed
to some very rich libraries in Germany, but it took 3 weeks to
get them. In a Ph.D. one looks at thousands of books. If you
need 3 weeks or even only one week to just look at a book,
imagine how much longer a good serious Ph.D. will take.
Fortunately, in IT and science, people are using pre-print
servers. But for other disciplines, it just diminishes the
quality of scientific work as people will only use what is
available.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

If there are problems,how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

Libraries should be able to transform everything into digital
copies and give access to those digitally. But this should
remain in the framework of diligent library management. This
means a person must be subscribed to the library in order to
access such content. Library content should be clearly marked
and not be allowed for republication (of the payload) on the
Internet. Publishing the link to the content in the library
should remain allowed. This little formalism guarantees that
the library copy isn't abused at scale without fraud or
visibility which protects the authors.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what
would be its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary
institutions should be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]

The world needs a library privilege along the lines described
above in order for our society to not lose very valuable
information and to make itaccessible. And this should not be a
concentration into one library. The legislative measure is that
libraries should have the right to digitise books and works and
make them available to their subscribers online and offline,
provided that those digitisedworks have a clear indication of
the originating library. The legal license would only extend to
the publication of the library, not to the publication by the
receiving party of that digitised work.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

If your view isthat a different solution is needed, what would
it be?

[Open question]

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of
works (i.e. books, sometimes alsoCDs and DVDs) to their users.
Recent technological developments have made it technically
possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access
to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via
networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such
e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and
libraries are currently experimenting with different business
models for the making available of works online, including
direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling
by aggregators.

(a)[In particular if you are alibrary:]Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable
the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of
books or other materials held in your collection?

(b)[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to borrow books or
other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?

(c)[In particular if you are aright holder:]Have you negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or other
materials electronically, including across borders?

YES– Please explain with specific examples

As indicated above, it does make no technical sense at all to
talk about temporary access when itcomes copies or lending,
because it makes no difference in cost or consequences as long
as no special devices are used. The library will send a copy.
Making a digital copy happens at no cost. This copy is sent to
a terminal or client computer. If those are local terminals, we
haven't achieved anything. If it is a remote terminal owned by
the user, sending a copy is equal to download of the work. So
instead of creating a new complex system of “temporary” copies
of digital works that technically can't work,I suggest a
different system in question 33 that would work.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO

 NO OPINION

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

See my suggestion in question 33………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n°
3) and the previous one (n° 2).

[In particular if you are an institutional user:]What
differences do you see in the management of physical and online
collections, including providing access to your subscribers?
What problems have you encountered?

[Open question]

This is only a question about transition. Because ultimately,
within thenext 20 years, all content will be digital or
digitised. The paper copies will be held for archive and in a
preservation mode (paper museum), but the day to day lending
and access will be digital. Themore obstacles libraries have,
the less knowledge willbe in society for the interested parties
and researchers.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

[In particular if you are a right holder:]What difference do you
see between libraries’ traditional activities such as
on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such
as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and
e-lending? What problems have you encountered?

[Open question]

If rights holders still depend on this distinction, they are
mentally still in the past century and want to hold the world
back. This will create trouble but will not hold the world from
moving on.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to
efforts by institutions such as libraries andarchives to
digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their
collections with an objective to preserve these collections
and, normally, to make them available to the public. Examples
are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early
partof the 20thcentury or whole collections of pictures of
historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key
principles on the digitisation and making available of out
of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the
normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass
digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the
basis of licence agreements between libraries and similar
cultural institutions onthe one hand and the collecting
societies representing authors and publishers on the other44

You will find more information about his MoU on the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm.

. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found only in
thearchives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and
made available online to everyone. The MoU is based on
voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management
Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to enact
legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such
licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of
representation of a collecting society or the recognition of an
“extended effect” to the licences granted)45

France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the
effects of the MoU.The French act (LOI n° 2012-287 du 1er mars
2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres
indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees collective

YES– Please explain why and how it could best be achieved

Instead of having the controversy 28 times and to have 28 local

Teaching

Directive 2001/29/EC46

Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for
non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow
a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his
course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or
of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected
content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation
from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional)
provision allows for rather different implementation at Member
States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to MemberState, with several Member States
providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for
certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and
study at home.

(a)[In particular if youare an end user/consumer or an
institutional user:]Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to use works or other subject-matter for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?

(b)[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you

works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?

YES – Please explain

Law and reality are far apart. While the copyright law is
pretending limitedcopying, the reality in our education
institutions is unlimited copying of all and everything at
need. This is now done with the photocopier. People will remain
at the photocopier, if the computer copies will be subject to
restrictions. This has a tremendous societal cost as
photocopying is much more expensive and resource intensive than
just creating a digital copy of a digital work at no cost.

Research

Directive 2001/29/EC47

States level.

Experience shows that people will use whatever is available at
their reach and not what is there. This means most scientific
works will be based on only a partial reflection and
understanding of the state of the art. This can only be solved
if libraries get the right to digitise everything and to
distribute the copies appropriately (see question 33)

Directive 2001/29/EC48

with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional)
provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other
subject-matter for persons withdisabilities (notably by
increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union)49

The Marrakesh Treaty50

Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by
Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities,
Marrakesh, June 17 to 28 2013.

has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for
persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright
that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute
and make available accessible format copies to visually
impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders.
The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and
ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain
provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

(a)[In particular if you are a person with a disability or an
organisation representing persons with disabilities:]Have you
experienced problems with accessibility to content, including
across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of
this exception?

(b)[In particular if you are an organisation providing services
for persons with disabilities:]Have you experienced problems
when distributing/communicating works published in special
formats across the EU?

(c)[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you

limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special

YES– Please explain by giving examples

Disabled have a similar issue as the libraries. Content
protection mechanisms have to allow for their special tools to
work. This means the known trick of showing pixels instead of
semantic content is not working for them. This has to be taken
into account when digitising the content in libraries. As the
1991 copyright gave a right to decompile a program for
interoperability, we need a right for the disabled to transform
digital content for access.

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51

For the purpose of the presentdocument, the term “text and data
mining” will be used.

are different terms used to describe increasingly important
techniques used in particular by researchers for the
exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g.,
journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of
software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of
relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights,
patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible
on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g.
journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g.
on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto
the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis.
Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or
other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation
from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g.content accessible to
general public without restrictions on the internet, open
access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are
covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of
Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining
activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None
of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does
not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in
several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go
beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain
the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need
to obtain “access” to content (i.e. being able to use e.g.
commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time,
practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of
subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52

See the document “Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

. In the contextof these discussions, other stakeholders argued
that no additional licences should be required to mine material
to which access has been provided through a subscription
agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and
data mining should beintroduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

Europe needs a privilege for search engines. But copyright could
make clear that a search engine that ignores the pseudo standard
on robots.txt is violating copyright if protected works are
concerned. This will allow people to opt out of search engines
and gives search engines the security they need to provide
their service. Look at all the debate in Germany about the
“Leistungsschutzrecht”.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can
copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial
cost. As a consequence, new types ofonline activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called
“user-generated content”. While users can create totally
original content, they can also take one or several
pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload
the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs53

A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video
(adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound recording), or
adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other
examples are “mash-ups”(blending two sound recordings), and
reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in
a blog.

. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification
of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results
from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing
content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity
is not “new” as such. However, the development of social
networking and social media sites that enable users to share
content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities
and increased the potential economic impact for those holding
rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the
preserve of a technically and artisticallyadept elite. With the
possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to
all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right
to property.

A specific Working Group wasset up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results or even the
definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were
presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One
view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in
particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as
combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of
photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is
needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between
rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded
between rightholders and the users generating the content. In
any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content
and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by
rightholders across different sectors as a result of the
“Licences for Europe” discussions54

more content

(c)[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you
experienced problems resulting from the way the users are using
pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?

YES – Please explain by giving examples

Look at tumblr and w3cmemes. They use photos and attachtext to
it. The photo is the infringing although less important part.
The problem is one of awareness and of rights management. A
user finds a nice photo on the internet and integrates it into
a presentation.This happens hundreds of times a day in Brussels
alone. They can' t find the author, rights holder, don't know
how to get rights or pay. Finally they rather take the risk to
infringe. This is at the very origin of the high speed of
creation in the digital world. If a law would effectively be
able to stop that (I doubt it), it would mean the speed of
innovation would be cut to a third at least.

Furthermore, the UK INDECS project has shown the virtuous circle
of creation, use, publication, re-use and creation and
publication that is followed by human creation of original
works. They rarely come out of the blue. Citation is important.
So the question is one of the height of the originality that is
required by law. On a slippery slope, copyright has turned from
something that protected original things towards a right that
protects everything that has alphanumeric characters. This
application to even trivial content and trivial pictures is
creating the UGC problem.

Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in
theirnational legislation exceptions or limitations to the
reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55

Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods
typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording
equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such
as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made
without their authorisation by certain categories of persons
(i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or
through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that
context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the
question arises as to whether the copying of files by
consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g.
when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store
multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and
her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the
application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in
some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders
whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider
already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could
potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies
could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees56

Communication "Unleashing the Potential of Cloud Computing in
Europe", COM(2012) 529 final.

57

These issueswere addressed in the recommendations of Mr António
Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private copying and
reprography levies. You can consult these recommendations on
the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/levy_reform/130131_levies-vitorino-recommendations_en.pdf.

.

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or
not of leviesto certain types of cloud-based services such as
personal lockers or personal video recorders.

In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the
scope and application of the private copying and reprography
exceptions58

Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

in the digital environment?

YES – Please explain

The rights on private copy have been pushed back since the WIPO
copyright agreements in 1996. The industry has obtained levies
on disks, computers, mobile phones, CDs, DVD's. But they still
claim infringement. The US system like iTunes that the user
uses doesn't know whether the user already paid for the copy by
paying levies on CD or DVD, computers etc. The question of
clarification is the one of scope. Once levies are paid, what
can the user do? And how is this conveyed. And how can the user
claim the overpaid levies or royalties back? The attack on the
private copy has gone way over board and it is time to clarify
the scope of rights acquired and to stop the double and even
triple payment for the same work by totally intransparent
system. The digital age allows us to do the distribution of
levies transparently, because the information is in the system.
We need to better use this.

How would changes in levies with respect to the application to

devices) impact the development and functioning of new business
models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

how far they lead to double payments. This has to lead to clear
requirements in the law for the system of levies.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply
different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the
freecirculation of goods and services in the Single Market. At
the same time, many Member States continue to allow the
indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all
transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product
subject to a levy issold (e.g. private person or business). In
that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption
and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these
situations and reduce the number of undue payments61

Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a
number of exclusive rights and,in the case of performers whose
performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights.
There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing
thetransferof rights from authors or performers to producers62

See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or
other subject matter is created in the context of an employment
contract63

See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive
96/9/EC.

. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member
States to regulate and there are significant differences in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist
between different sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performersare
not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as
regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared
along the whole value chain. Another commonly raised issue
concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders
are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice
to improve their situation and that action at EU level is
necessary.

[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you
receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your
works and performances?

We need to invest more in online payment. The technical

Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE64

Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual
property rights.

provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related
rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this text65

You will find more information on the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm

. Concerns have been raised as to whether someof its provisions
are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the
digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be
insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the
dissemination of digital content on the internet; onthe other
hand, there are concerns about the current balance between
enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental
rights, in particular the right for a private life and data
protection. While it cannot be contested that enforcement
measuresshould always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for
copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial
purpose66

For example when the infringing content is offered on a website
which gets advertising revenues that depend on the volume of
traffic.

. One means to do this could be to clarify the roleof
intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67

This clarification should not affect the liability regime of
intermediary service providers established by Directive
2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

. At the same time, there could be clarification of the
safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for
private users.

Should the civil enforcementsystem in the EU be rendered more
efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a
commercial purpose?

 YES – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

NO – Please explain

The trouble arises ifthe gap between live in society in general
and the proscriptive positivism of a law collide. In this case,
the government would have to enforce against the entire
population. The copyright laws have been denatured and gone
over board the past 15 years. The very existence of the pirate
party is a proof that large parts of the population is not in
line with what the law proscribes. More enforcement will just
mean more pirate party until the entire system is overturned.
Brute force MPAA enforcement has just brought hysteria in the
legal system and blind mass judgements like the latest cases of
OLG Koeln show. More enforcement will just criminalise more kids
in the schoolyard. You have to want that.

Inparticular, is the current legal framework clear enough to
allow for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as
Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment
service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If
not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?

Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the
right balance is achieved between the right to have one’s
copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of
private life and protection of personal data?

I heard somewhere that the entertainment industry in Germany is
making more money with legal action than with selling of disks.
The entertainment industry is holding on to an overcome business
model and tortures society with its remaining powers. They
should rather invest their money into new models. Apple has
shown that it is feasible. This is better thanhaving pervasive
monitoring of Internet traffic by private entities to enforce.
The pendulum swings back a bit as past decisions on holding
people responsible even if their router was hacked. All this
has let to the death of freely available Wifi networks at great
social cost. There has to be a new limit. Below a certain number
of copies or infringements, legal actions should be just
precluded. This could be covered if the legal system introduces
a general fair use clause.

A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU CopyrightTitle has been
present in the copyright debate for quite some time now,
although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would
totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and
replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the
only manner in which a truly Single Market for content
protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe
that the same objectivecan better be achieved by establishing a
higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal
systems.

Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright
Title, as a meansof establishing a consistent framework for
rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a
single framework for enforcement?

YES

 NO

 NO OPINION

Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in
the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member
State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
