 YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

[In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requests for multi-territorial licenses will mostly be directed towards the film producer or the broadcaster since the right to dispose will generally be assigned by means of collective agreement. However, the rights for certain uses, such as retransmission or cross-border online use of audiovisual productions, may not be transferred. In these cases, agreement between producers/broadcasters and other rights holders must be concluded. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the demand for Danish television productions and cinema films is quite large in the traditional market, cross-border services are only requested in relation to a limited group of Danish speaking people living abroad, and not for truly cross-border services targeted at the European public in general. Even this demand is limited, which was seen by the discontinuation of the Danish public service channel's satellite transmission in Southern Europe at the end of 2013 as the cost of satellite transmission was larger than the proceeds from the service. Following this, Copydan concluded a license with an online TV-distributor, which has come into effect as of January 2014.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The amount of requests are limited by the fact that some licenses in some areas already exist,  for instance concerning Danish soldiers abroad and sailors on Danish shipping vessels.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As to the development of new cross-border online services, it seems that the obstacles are practical, and not related to copyright.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above  -  what would be the best way to tackle them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The practical problems are primarily economic and market related. Private film producers depend on maximum earnings in the different territories and media service providers must respect this. Broadcasters too, must take into account the possible turnover from on demand services. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Licensing to some territories or the entire EU territory against an upfront payment is economically inexpedient. Users' interest in the different territories will vary. The sequence of release of different windows must be adapted to individual markets. It is therefore of the utmost importance that clearance of cross-border online use can be settled contractually.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clearance of the rights of authors and performers on a work by work basis is still necessary under certain collective agreements, primarily regarding television productions. Theoretically such clearance may cover one or more (or all) territories but it should respect well established contractual practices. Establishing multi-territorial tariffs will meet with considerable practical difficulties. The economic value of different territories can vary greatly and the market value will remain highly uncertain within a forseeable future. For public service television broadcasters the income from utilising cross-border rights will be nil or negligable. Their interest in paying for such rights can be assumed to be similarly modest.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The only alternative to this type of clearance will be a general contractual remuneration scheme at the European level, cf. our answers to questions 72-74.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain by giving examples
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See the answer to question 4.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by giving examples
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO OPINION

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What should be remembered is that copyright actually gives solutions to a number of problems that would otherwise be left to law of contracts, which, as can be seen in relation to sports rights, creates difficulties. Removing the possibility of territorially restricting copyright licenses might not have the intended effect, but may instead lead to more complex contractual regulation, which could limit the access to cultural content from other European countries.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instead, as a means to solve the cross-border problem, the European Union could work to enhance collective management of rights, and also create a legal  foundation for cross-border services based on systems such as extended collective licensing or other collective licensing systems, in line with the recommendation of the Memorandum of Understanding for Out-of-Commerce Works.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations  -  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  -  sufficiently clear? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The question is best answered through case law in the EU Court of Justice which will take into regard specificities of different situations which is not suitable for legislative solution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reference to the "country of origin principle" is not appropriate. This principle was introduced in the Satellite and Cable Directive as an exception from the general rule governing communication to the public: the "principle of country of reception" which also applies to cable retransmission.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As to on demand cross-border services, no parallel can be drawn to the satellite broadcasting right where the "country of origin" principle is closely connected with the direct and uninterrupted delivery of program carrying signals from the uplink station via satellite to the footprint area. On demand services have a completely different character and the multi-facetted problems related to their use are best solved for the benefit of all interested parties in the country of reception according to local law.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See also the answers to question 72-74.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

 NO OPINION

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application of more than one right is not a problem. Dealing with several rights within an agreement on economic exploitation is common practice in licensing of services in the audiovisual field.

Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linking may require authorisation. Certain types of linking constitutes an act of communication to the public of protected content and can be detrimental to the rights holders
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public  -  or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

* Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DSF and Filmex finds that the current EU law and the international treaties are adequate tools to provide a balance between the public interest and the needs of the rights holders and give the necessary flexibility.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The exception from the reproduction right to allow private copying is in the interest of the public and performers receive fair compensation in a number of European countries. The CJEU rulings have clarified many questions and provided tools for improvement of national practice. However, a number of member states have not introduced or have not updated their legislation in order to take into account new technology and new patterns of copying. It should be considered to remedy these shortcomings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In general, exceptions damage the cultural production as content creators loose encouragement to create new works. Exceptions to copyright should only be applied as a measure of last resort and licensing should be the preferred solution. In different member states, different levels of licensing tools and solutions exist. We think the best approach is to seek to strengthen licensing solutions through positive and constructive initiatives such as Licensing for Europe. Creating mandatory exceptions on the other hand, would damage existing licensing models and thus damage the creation of jobs in the creative sector.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the existing EU regulation, the Danish law provide the necessary tools for licensing of works and performances in libraries, archives, educational institutions, hospitals, prisons etc. The flexibility provided by the acquis communautaire allows members states to find the optimal solutions according to traditions, needs, and licensing infrastructure. Consequently, there is no need for a change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain why 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The existing regulatory framework allows member states to find a balance between the public interests and the needs of the rights holders. It is possible to take into account national circumstances regarding licensing infrastructure (bargaining relations between producers and authors and performers, representative bodies of rights holders, etc.), cultural needs, educational needs, etc., when forming national legislation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A fair use exception does not fit with the European law tradition. Even in the USA, where common law is used, significant uncertainties still prevail, especially regarding new forms of use, even with decades of judgments concerning fair use. Periodic revision would be a problem as well, as revising the law could disrupt the perceived balance of thousands and thousands of contracts concerning rights. DSF and Filmex believe that specific exceptions combined with flexible licensing solutions will meet the demands of users, rights holders and the market better than a general fair use exception.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Licensing, especially collective licensing, provides a more flexible solution to both users and rights holders. That was also a conclusion in the Commission's Licences for Europe project. Some countries, esp. the Nordic countries, experience success with the Extended Collective Licensing model (ECL), which gives the users access to protected material for use in many fields, such as educational institutions, use in libraries, archives, museums, etc. In addition, other models of licensing should be developed by the European institutions and by the rights holders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The licenses that are based on the ECL system cover the use of works in Denmark. Such ECL licenses are limited to national use, because the extended collective licensing only applies within the Danish territory. To be able to give such licenses cross-border effect, it would require that licenses based on ECL or other forms of collective rights management issued in one member state to be recognized in other member states. In the 2011 MoU it is written in preamble 11 that they are "calling on the European Commission, to the extent required to ensure legal certainty in a cross-border context, to consider the type of legislation to be enacted ...".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similar thinking could be developed in areas such as online distribution of audiovisual performances, subject to a solution of the issue of remuneration of authors and performers.

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across borders,  to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private study?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Collections in national institutes are often in the national language. Therefore, there is no significant demand for access to Danish collections from other countries. In Denmark, there are numerous agreements regarding the mass use in libraries and archives. The budget of these are often linked to public service obligations  -  which are limited to the relevant member state, and their funding therefore does not allow for entering into cross-border licenses.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The general ECL provision in the Danish Copyright Act can be used as the legal foundation for an agreement between an institutional user and CMOs for giving access to a collection or parts thereof.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is mentioned in the explanatory notes to article 50.2 of the Danish Copyright Act that the provision can be applied when wanting to digitize cultural heritage.

In our experience, collective licensing facilitates easy and straightforward access to content, while ensuring that the rights holders are remunerated for the exploitation of their works.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are licenses for numerous uses of audiovisual material in teaching, through the ECL agreements and individual mandates in Denmark. This includes the recording and streaming of television and film in schools, by teachers and students. This also covers the use of large amounts of European content, which exceeds the actual demand, why cross-border access is not a pressing issue for schools.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Denmark, we apply extended collective licensing. Because ECL based licenses include all works of all artists of a defined type it can provide the broadest possible access to use of content and a high level of legal certainty for the users. At the same time it provides rights holders with fair remuneration for the exploitation of their works and support that content creators are able and encouraged to continue creating new works. The system is accepted by both educational institutions and rights holders and has been for many years, which is the best testimony of its success.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The use of the ECL is consequently very successful, and enables the rights holders' organizations in Copydan to clear the rights for many different uses in schools. The main licenses cover almost 100 % of all schools in Denmark.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copydan in general collects annually millions of euro in remuneration to Danish and foreign rights holders for use of protected subject-matter in educational institutions. Hence, these funds are important for the possibility of producing and distributing new creative content to the benefit of the educational system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The development of the licenses is ongoing and occurs through continued discussions with the educational sector and the rights holder organizations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All licenses allow the institutions to copy for educational purposes and for internal administrative use.

Answer to question 58-63 from DSF and Filmex:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is difficult to give exact answers to the questions, since there is no common definition of UGC.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our overall opinion is that UGC provides an excellent tool for communication, freedom of expression, inspiration and social development.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, when protected works and performances are included in UGC, existing national and international regulation of copyright and related rights must be respected and use of protected content must be authorized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, the number of infringements are extremely high and very often the harm to rights holders is substantial.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For practical and economic reasons it is very difficult to obtain damages in case of infringement and usually a compromise entailing removal of the non-authorized content will be preferred.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since public debate on this issue often mention the presumed "non-commercial use", we find it relevant to point to the fact that those who really profit from the UGC are the internet giants. This fact explains why Google and others are the most insistent spokespersons for exceptions in this area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It seems to us that the EU Commission should take upon themselves to develop new strategies in this area. The current practice is mainly to the benefit of non-EU players and is detrimental to the creative sector of Europe.

* Private copying and reprography

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no need for legislative clarification regarding the private copying exception in EU legislation. The CJEU provides useful and clear interpretation in areas where guidance is needed, such as reimbursement systems for cross-border sales, the principle of country of reception (compensation where harm to right holders is happening), professional uses, and funding for social and cultural activities, etc. Some issues are pending, such as the Copydan vs. Nokia case, and the pending ruling of the CJEU will provide certainty in the areas concerned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, we would recommend the EU Commission to initiate an investigation of the situation in the member states as to whether or not the national regulation complies with the intentions of the EU legislation and the rulings of the CJEU.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some countries have not taken into account, that new technology changes the users reproduction practice and provides extended access to private copying (this is true for Denmark where compensation is still limited to blank media, which causes considerable losses to Danish rights holders). Other countries have deteriorated compensation schemes for purely political and financial reasons (Spain), and some countries (UK) intend to introduce legislation that suggests that private copying does not at all harm rights holders.

Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The question is confusing, since in practice it will not be possible at the point of licensing to decide whether the harm to rights holders will be minimal.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It has been made clear by rulings of the CJEU (VG Wort case) that any licensing of the right to private copying is without legal effect in countries where an exception for private copying exists. This means that in the licensing process it cannot be taken into account whether a possibility of private copying exists or not, and the licencing agreement can only cover the exclusive rights. The rights holders can authorize the use of the productions regarding the exclusive rights, such as making available on demand, catch up services, broadcasting and re-broadcasting, cable-retransmission etc., but private copying is not negotiable and must be compensated by national compensation schemes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing  allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders' revenue on the other? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New online services, such as cloud computing, do not conflict with existing licensing models. Since online services requires clearance of rights of making available on demand, agreements with the rights holders (producers, authors and performers, and also broadcaster) will be obligatory. Such agreements will not have any impact on the rights of the users to make private copies since such copying is regulated by national legislation on basis of the EU legislation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
National legislation on compensation for private copying must take into account that new ways of copying has emerged. Instead of blank media like dvds, copying capacity in the cloud is available, and EU and national legislation should take this into account when deciding rules on fair compensation to the rights holders.

* Fair remuneration of authors and performers

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The best mechanism to ensure an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of works and performances in the digital world is a combination of exclusive rights and remuneration rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The exclusive rights presently granted by EU law must be fully upheld and respected. They provide an important and indispensable part of the basis for any bargaining, collective or individual, of the fundamental terms for the performance of an artistic work, and for the exploitation of it in different forms and media.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, when it comes to cross-border online use of audiovisual productions, negotiations based on exclusive rights have not provided adequate or meaningful economic solutions for performers. This is partly due to the fact that in the audiovisual field performers have very little bargaining strength in most European countries. It also reflects the difficulty for performers and producers alike trying to assess the economic value of such use in a market not yet fully functioning.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is why the EU must introduce a supplementary right to equitable remuneration in favour of performers for the making available on demand of audiovisual productions. The right must be unwaivable and the remuneration shall be collected from the user and subject to mandatory collective management. This additional right shall not prejudice existing or future agreements, whether individual or collective, granting payment for the use of the performance, whether or not such agreements include a transfer or assignment of the making available right.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A complementary right of this nature would greatly facilitate digital cross-border licensing and would help the development of a single market for audiovisual productions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DSF and Filmex responded in 2011 to the Green Paper on cross-borders online services of audiovisual performances, and we would like to include this answer in the present consultation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"An unwaivable right to remuneration is required at European level to guarantee audiovisual performers proportional remuneration for online uses of their performances. The remuneration should be claimed from the user. The right should be unwaivable and apply to the performer irrespective of whether or not he has transferred his exclusive right to the producer or a third party. The remuneration right shall further apply independently of any individual or collective agreements in the respective countries regarding contractual remuneration. Agreements on supplemental payment (royalties or bonuses) only exist in a very few EU member states and often have a cultural function enabling performers to accept lower initial fees than in other countries with a view to stimulating audiovisual productions with expected narrow audiences.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Such royalty agreements should therefore not effect these performers' rights to a share in a general European remuneration scheme.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A remuneration scheme will reduce the need for up front payment for the economic exploitation rights and thus facilitate the clearing of these rights. At the same time it will ensure, that the remuneration right does not become illusory, as has been the case in most member states in respect of the remuneration right for rental of films, cf. the directive on lending and rental.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The European remuneration right scheme should be subject to compulsory administration by collecting societies".


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EU should protect performers when signing a contract, since they will always be in a weak bargaining position. Transfer of all rights in return for a lump sum should not be allowed, not even when specifying payment for each use, since neither of the parties are able to estimate the value of the rights at the point of contract. The EU should introduce a principle of fair ongoing payment for internet use of works and performances.

* Respect for rights
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The civil enforcement system in the EU should be made more efficient so as to effectively address and deter services offering infringing material to their users, whether funded by subscription, donation or advertising.  These types of services should not be entitled to the immunity from liability offered by the Article 14 hosting exception of the E-Commerce Directive.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current system of notice and take down puts all the resource and financial burdens on rights holders while services have no incentive to assist in detection of illegal content, even though the technological means are available.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are technological measures available for service providers to allow them easily and effectively to identify files and infringements, based on prior notifications given to them by rights holders.  Many services now employ such measures, but unfortunately most providers still do not adopt this technology or take these steps. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system of notice and takedown is ineffective to address the problem of illegal content appearing online. Once files have been removed through a notice and takedown procedure, they can quickly re-appear: either being re-uploaded by the same internet user, or by a different user of the same online service, or alternatively by a user of an entirely different online service or platform. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need clarification that the hosting exemption is only available to particular activities, which are merely technical, automatic and passive, where carried out by neutral online services, and not to platforms, which are designed or optimised to make available or facilitate the making available of illegal content, such as material which infringes copyright.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, we need clarification that notice and takedown means "notice and stay down" and that service providers are required to remove not only an example URL but all instances of the specific infringement or illegal content once they are notified and/or become aware
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough to allow for  sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe that the legal framework, which establishes the liability of intermediaries, has created the wrong balance. It creates incentives for intermediaries to be entirely passive so as to avoid liability for licensing.  They have no incentive to inform their customers and consumers or to help with awareness and education of consumers.  The notice and take down system is placing a burden on rights holders but is not operating to its full benefit.  The responsibility of other intermediaries, such as advertising or payment services, must be more clearly defined, perhaps in the form of a joint agreement or MOU to ensure they take active role in preventing their services being used to support unauthorised and illegal businesses.
