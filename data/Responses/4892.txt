Although publications in all scientific disciplines may be accompanied by figures, in the
Humanities these images (or artefacts displayed by the images) may be not mere illustrations
but constitute the object of study in itself. They are therefore indispensable to the publication,
and for scholarly public discussions of the results. For example, this is the case in research
fields such as art history, archaeology, design studies, film studies, cultural studies,
discourse studies, visual studies, etc.


As a result, in the course of the publication process, many Humanities researchers must face

                                                                                                 1
the obligation to clear copyright on reproductions of visual images (works of art, artefacts
and other objects in museums and private collections, etc.) that may involve a contractual
agreement and/or a fee payment to the owner of the artefact, the museum or gallery and/or
the photographer who took the picture.


This is especially causing problems in the context of the current Open Access developments
because these costs are often calibrated on the basis of the potential audience for the
publication. In other words, an Open Access publication – with a potentially infinite audience
– could incur prohibitive costs.


Related to the above point, is the use of literary texts as an object of study in literary studies.
For example, in a research paper on a contemporary German writer, a German literary
researcher may need to quote a substantial fragment from the work of this writer, whereas in
a paper of an historian or of a linguist, it is mandatory to quote the sources that (s)he
analyses. These analyses may concern entire texts and not just excerpts. Again, the pending
arrival of Open Access to research publications brings in new copyrights issues that need to
be solved.


A related issue concerns audio-visual works, such as commercials, documentaries, film,
television and the like. Also many products in the digitally born domain, like computer
games, fall under this heading. In addition, it is important not to forget non-visual material,
like music, recorded speech or other sound fragments. These products are the object of study
of numerous research disciplines in the Humanities, including communication studies, media
studies, linguistics, cultural studies and contemporary history.


Although related to the issue of still images, a rough but important difference is that still
images are often found in the public institutions (museums, archives, etc.), whereas live
images are primarily found in the commercial organisations (advertising, film industry, etc.).
Clearly, this is not a sharp dividing line, as films and documentaries may well be found in
museums, while still images like old posters or advertisements may fall within the
commercial domain. Any copyright law reform needs to take into account issues linked to the
various dimensions related to image issues for research purposes (still vs. audio-visual, and
commercial domain vs. public domain).
