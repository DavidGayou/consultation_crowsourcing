     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore

modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

I. - INTRODUCTION
The Consultation is organized in almost 80 questions, some of them being fundamental and
with far reaching implications, some requiring whole new considerations. In spite of said wide
scope, a sound evidence base for this consultation has not been established.

It is also to be noted that the Consultation makes no distinction between the different types of
works (which entail different business models) when and if required. The same questions and
answers in certain cases cannot be the same for a painting and a film.

The reading of the questionnaire leads to the impression that it is aimed to justify measures
that are bound to weaken important exclusive rights in order to pave the legal infrastructure to
favor the deployment and development of pan-European services, comforted by wider (and
maybe some new) exceptions to copyright.

The value of the so called “content” sector including in particular the film industry, and its
contribution to the overall EU economy and cultural diversity, rests entirely on the ability to
reliably produce and exploit copyright protected works. Thus, the impact of any actions
affecting the sector must be carefully assessed. In particular, we refer to the impact of
introducing changes to the vary basis of how the film production market and the entire audio-
visual sector function and flourish in the EU, enabling the variety of works currently produced
in Europe, each addressing the respective problems the different Member States are facing
respectively narrating stories from a Member State’s culture and history.

It is important to understand that there are different market conditions that are relevant to the
various types of creative content. Such differences must be taken into account in the
foundational approach to the consultation in order to arrive at sound policy, which does not
appear to be the case here. The production of film and audiovisual content requires substantial
investments and carries significant financial risks on what, as compared to production of some
other forms of copyrightable content. The “output” of film and audiovisual production are
essentially one-off prototypes: a movie, a TV series whose prospects for success are a gamble.
In a good case scenario, it can take many years to recoup costs for a successful production,
disregarding the losses incurred by those that fail to capture market attention.

Also exceptions and other constraints need to be considered very carefully against this reality.
Exceptions cannot be based in the presumed existence of guessed demands from the market;
demands which are qualified as mere guesses as not study has measured it. Important legal
innovations should be grounded in more than mere guess. In that sense, the experience of
entrepreneurs has been not considered. In what respects the film industry figures are available,
and its analysis would have evidenced that the demand of non national EU productions in the
Member States is in most of the cases marginal, if any. There are not acceptable bases for
putting at risk a system that is delivering quality and innovation and supporting tens of
thousands of jobs across the EU.

Beyond stakeholder discussions about cross-border access to services and portability, the
vision that comes through via many of the questions taken together is that the Commission is
looking for pan-European distribution platforms to deliver content that will be attractive and
available readily and on easier terms for such platforms and to ban geo-blocking or otherwise
enable cross-border access to content. In the audiovisual sector, available evidence suggests
that this is mostly locally produced content and non-European origin content. International
distribution platforms, already dominant in certain segments of the national markets in

                                                                                               7
Europe, would be the presumed beneficiaries of a requirement for pan-European licensing,
likely to the detriment of national or European services and film productions. English
language services might also find especially fertile grounds as a lingua franca, again to the
detriment of more culturally specific offerings and the very cultural diversity. Furthermore,
the existence of over 30 different languages in the EU cannot be disregarded or treated as an
impediment for a single cultural market.

It is beyond discussion that consumers are demanding access to content on terms that they
will find acceptable: high quality, convenient, reasonable and timely. The last decade has
seen unprecedented innovation and investment in content. Consumers in the EU have legal
access to more copyrighted content on more devices than ever before, including some 3000
on-demand audiovisual services. A recent research published in Screen Digest shows that
online video transactions for 20 EEA countries soared to 58.8 million from 2006 to 2012, an
astonishing growth rate by any measure. And, total spending on online video transactions
rose 97.1% from 2011 to 2012, while spending by European consumers on digital video
subscriptions increased by 327; 7% in 2012 alone. Licensing of these services and the
consumption of them take-up and take place in the context of the existing EU copyright
framework. Facts that evidence that the actual system works. And it does not stand in the way
of the introduction of other new services, including cross-border services.

As before, audiovisual producers do not see market evidence that consumers generally are
demanding access to cross border audiovisual platforms. Across the EU the demand is
overwhelmingly for national films and channels.

Importantly, and as described below, copyright is protected as a fundamental right in the EU
legal order. While not absolute, such protection entails confirmation and rationalization of
certain fundamental aspects of copyright, including the ability of rightholders to control and
exploit their creative works, whether content is distributed on the street or streamed from the
cloud. Exception to and limitations on exclusive rights can only be justified on the grounds of
clear and compelling evidence.



     II.      Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.



9
    This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

                                                                                              8
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.


     1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
        trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which
        you live?

    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

First, it has to be recalled that national offers (especially in the audiovisual area) are plentiful.
This question is phrased in a one-sided manner, pre-supposing that there are no means
currently available to access content across borders – when in fact, there are a variety of ways
such as the electronic-sell-through market, as well as situations where local operators provide
content portability for subscribers to watch their content on mobile devices regardless of their
location. See also “Licenses for Europe” WG1 pledge of audiovisual industry representatives
to continue to develop cross-border portability of subscription services. The biggest obstacle
at this time to the digital single market is in fact the absence of sufficient demand to
incentivize distributors to provide commercially viable pan-EU services for all content. As a
matter of fact, nothing in the EU copyright acquis precludes audiovisual licensors and
licensees to agree on viable licensing terms, be it on a linguistic, territorial, multi-country,
pan-European or even global basis. But consumers overwhelmingly favor nationally based
services, and those from linguistically and culturally similar countries. This is empirically
demonstrated by the experience with cable and satellite television, for example.
Furthermore, in order to meet a possible demand, audiovisual productions, unlike music,
require that the dialogues or speech be either subtitled or dubbed to the different languages.
Though the changes that the digital technologies make possible that the recording of a work
may offer the viewer different dubbed/subtitled versions, the production of those tracks are
beyond the resources of most European producer. But technical or accessibility costs are not
the sole impediment. Multiterritorial access require, multiterritorial marketing, and at the
moment no EU distributor has the resources to assume this task, especially taking into account
the prospects of market return.
Considering the above, a forced multiterritorial access, should the legal environment change,
would favor exclusively the use of English as lingua franca in the EU.


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
  NO


There are no significant problems in providing on line across border services other than the
lack of a critical mass of demand that may justify the investments required.


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.


The actual demand is very rare especially if one sets aside the matter of linguistically
connected countries/regions (France/Belgium, Germany/Austria).
Content owners seek to ensure that their works are made available to consumers in a way that
is most responsive to market needs and capacities. At present, this tends to take place
primarily on a territorial basis, due to cultural/language, regulatory and structural realities –
not to mention demand. And especially as far as European works are concerned, one has to


                                                                                                  10
bear in mind that said works are mainly financed by national-oriented broadcasters and
platforms.
The current legal framework enables the content sector to distribute their works on a multi-
territorial basis, but it also enables them to respect important market factors such as demands
of localization, territorial exclusivity for those who significantly co-finance the production of
the work, and cultural diversity.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?


We are not aware of any problems having occurred other than possible disagreements on the
level of remuneration in exchange for the rights granted, as may be in any negotiation.
At the same time, it is in the genuine interest of rightholders to know of any such problems.
Rightholders are in the business of providing access, not of creating problems to access, and
problems with access mean in principle less revenues for rightholders.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples

While the approaches of individual licensors will obviously vary, there are objective reasons
for territorial licensing. One is that it is most responsive to addressing local consumer
demand which tends towards a preference for local and non-EU content, with language
playing a role and due to cultural differences and consumer preferences. Another is that
market and regulatory conditions vary from country to country, de-facto imposing territorial
licensing in certain circumstances or dictating release schedules that may vary from country to
country.

It is not at all clear how the international platforms that would benefit from the Commission’s
apparent plans would be required to accommodate these constraints and others such as
contributing to financing local production, respecting current local cultural diversity
considerations, addressing VAT and other tax issues, complying data protection law etc., in
short to behave responsibly.

Today some of them knowingly offer or list sites that manifestly do not have the authorization
to offer the content that they make available. They are able to make money from advertising,
and also from trading on the private data of EU consumers. As mentioned above they want
the benefits of the EU market and acquis without assuming the corresponding obligations.

For certain types of audiovisual content, production models are built around joint ventures
(co-productions or co-financings) which rely for a substantial proportion of the financing on
territorial splits of the rights amongst the partners. Consequently, in exchange for assuming
part of the risk of production, a local financing partner often acquires exclusive rights to

                                                                                              11
license or distribute a film in a particular territory and/or language, but not others. These
territorial splits would be substantially de-valued, would their exclusivity be taken away. The
local distributor, often a co-financer would then have to face another factor threatening the
recoupment of his investment if its content was accessed by the national consumer through
any means in another country before the national release. Without the practice of co-
productions/co-financings, production levels for European works would drop precipitously,
unless the EU or the member states stepped in with additional direct financing support. Thus,
a « single audiovisual market » would come at the high price of a loss of cultural diversity,
which protection the European Union is aiming for in its Treaty.

6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
X NO –
No further measures are needed in terms of the copyright related acquis. The current
legislative framework provides the necessary foundation for cross-border availability of
services and in fact cross border licensing exists. It permits licensing of content territorially,
or on cross-border or even pan-EU bases and is not an obstacle per se. Lack of harmonization
of VAT rates, consumer protection rules, protection of minors regulations, quality of service
issues, network capacities are more likely to be relevant obstacles to provide cross-border
services, but, as laid out before, small and medium sized companies prefer to serve national
markets as they can accommodate those most responsively according to market needs and
capacities and can thus ensure best their own economic stability and serve consumers best.
National and European regulations co-exist in every sector and what matters is whether there
are economic obstacles for a content provider to increase cross-border availability of services.
As mentioned, the investment in exclusive territorial rights is often also a vital tool and
incentive for local distributors to invest in co-productions and to ensure recoupment of their
investment. We would like to stress in this regard that the European single internal market is
about the freedom to provide services, not about an obligation. Thus service providers which
chose to provide cross-border services are free to do so already under the existing acquis.
Instances do exist where it may make sense commercially for a digital service provider to do
so.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online

   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
X YES

The scope of the making available in cross-border situations is sufficiently clear – particularly
in light of recent jurisprudence of the CJEU23. This jurisprudence confirms that this right is
intended to be broad, durable, flexible and adaptable to technological development.

The exclusive right of “making available”, as established by the WIPO Copyright Treaty and
implemented in the EU by the Copyright Directive, extends to the offering to the public of a
work for individualized streaming or downloading as well as the actual transmission of a
work to members of the public – from a place and at a time individually chosen by them,
irrespective of the technical means used for making available24. The very nature of the making
available right for copyright works is such that it takes place both where the offer is made and
where it is capable of being accessed by consumers. This is a reflection of the interactive
nature of the right. This is important not only to the licensing of content but also to
determining the jurisdiction and/or the applicable law for rightholders to enforce their rights
against infringers and online intermediaries (see below our response to question 9). Overall,
the indeed the perceived “elasticity” of the right has enhanced the development of new on-
demand services beyond what was known in 1996 when WCT was concluded. This is a right
intended to accommodate technological change and accordingly must retain some degree of
flexibility.


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief25)?
      YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
As noted above, a “clarification” which would limit the scope of the making available is
neither necessary nor justified. In this regard, we note that footnote 23 provides further
information on one such clarification in the following terms:

             “The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the
            copyright relevant act that must be licensed in a single Member State (the "country of
            origin", which could be for example the Member State in which the content is
            uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
            Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already
            been introduced at EU level with regard to broadcasting by satellite...”

   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                                          14
It is unclear on how this would operate in practice and find any comparisons to
communication to the public by satellite to be inapt given the nature of the technologies
concerned. Such principle may seriously reduce the scope for licensing and enforcing the
making available right which is the cornerstone of the digital environment.

As a general rule of copyright, it is the law of the country of destination that applies to the
exploitation of rights. This rule (close to what is above described as "targeting" approach) is
also enshrined in international conventions. This principle has an effect on the scope of the
rights and any applicable exceptions; on the rules regarding the transfer of rights; on the status
of the rightholder (as a beneficiary of protection, e.g., as author or co-author); on collective
rights management; and on the enforcement of the rights. The principle of the country of
destination is valid, and no clarification is needed. It has to be maintained. In the audiovisual
sector, this principle is applied without prejudice of international private law and contractual
agreements.

The country of origin principle, on the other hand, does not apply to copyright, and this has
been recognised by the relevant Directives (e.g., the Services Directive). If it were applied to
copyright, this would not only be in contradiction to international law, but it would also create
serious imbalances: due to the different interpretation/application of limitations/exceptions
and differences in enforcement and transfers/contract law in Member States, applying the
country of origin principle to copyright would lead to a "race to the bottom". "Making
available" services would originate in the Member States with the lowest level of protection
and the lowest revenues for rightholders. This would be in contradiction to the explicitly
declared objective of the acquis communautaire, in particular Directive 2001/29, which is to
safeguard a high level of protection for rightholders.

The only area in copyright where such “country of origin” principle has been introduced (see
article 1.2.b of Directive 93/83/EEC (“La communication au public par satellite a lieu
uniquement dans l'État membre dans lequel, sous le contrôle et la responsabilité de
l'organisme de radiodiffusion, les signaux porteurs de programmes sont introduits dans une
chaîne ininterrompue de communication conduisant au satellite et revenant vers la terre”) has
not proven to facilitate clarification of rights and/or paneuropean broadcasting of copyright
protected content (especially for European works), and it is only when the « country of
destination » principle was reintroduced (through conditional access systems and encryption
of the satellite signals) that the satellite market in Europe (mainly based on local-demand
oriented satellite platforms) really took off.

2.     Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
X NO


                                                                                               15
As a general matter, digital transmissions in the context of on-demand services will implicate
the making available right and reproduction rights. Reproduction is implicated in upload
where platforms need to make copies to set up their offers to the public (upstream) copies
made on servers and copies made on users’ devices including where the platform’s service
involves the licensing of subsequent copies to consumers (downstream). That said, the
question is rather confusing and it is misleading to refer to this as “a single act of economic
exploitation” given the nature of services offered to consumers many of which offer the
possibility to make multiple copies on multiple devices. One should in any event be careful
not to confuse or even conflate of acts by platforms and acts by users.

As noted above, several thousand on-demand services are operating in the EU and licensing
content on a daily basis. They are acquiring film content, investing in new business models,
clearing music and other rights, experimenting with new consumer interfaces and taking risks
on a scale never seen before.

In many goods and services protected by copyright (CDs, DVDs, films, broadcasting) rights
of several different rightholders subsist. This has never caused any problems due to the
(presumed or negotiated) transfer of rights and their bundling, often in the hands of the
producer or publisher. In addition, where rights cannot be administered by rightholders
themselves, usually collecting societies as their trustees are in charge of the management of
rights. In any case, rightholders tend to organize themselves in order to provide users with a
“one-stop-shop” for the use of rights (or at least categories of rights), and this also holds true
for the digital/on-line environment.

A legislative intervention which would operate to limit the scope of the making available
and/or reproduction rights and thereby hinder the ability of audio-visual producer to license
their works would also raise issues with the EU’s obligations under international copyright
norms. In addition to the potential violation of the fundamental right protected under Article
17(2) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (“Intellectual property shall be
protected”), international rules are also relevant to either wholesale abolition or curtailment of
an exclusive right protected by international copyright treaties. In this regard, the provisions
establishing the making available and reproduction rights in the WCT, the TRIPs Agreement
and Berne Convention collectively would prohibit contracting parties from suspending
protection for acts of exploitation subject to these exclusive rights – unless of course they can
be justified pursuant to the three-step test (see Berne Article 9, TRIPs Article 13 and WCT
Article 10) or other provisions (e.g., Article 11bis(2) which is not relevant to making available
or reproduction), quod non.

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU26 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'

memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU27 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
This question is rather general and appears to underestimate the complexity of matters in the
field. It is important to understand the context who has provided the hyperlink and to what
purpose. While the EU copyright legislation and jurisprudence (the EU Copyright Acquis)
generally provides the requisite clarity to answer questions, as to whether a given act falls
within the scope of the communication to the public right, it will be a fact specific inquiry in
some cases. This flexibility is vital to both rightholders and users. National courts have made
important contributions to the understanding of the communication to the public right and
indeed, as the Consultation Document notes; the CJEU has recently been asked to look at
several important fact patterns. The importance that hyperlinking plays with regard to content
delivery online means that a broad exclusion from copyright would not only undermine basic
licensing scenarios online but it would also seriously hinder the ability of rightholders to fight
copyright infringement online.

The answer to the question of whether a particular act of linking to a work rises to the level of
making available is fact specific. It depends on the situation. Has the provider of the link
performed a material intervention to make the content available/accessible to a new audience?
Has the provider acted beyond the scope of the neutrality, i.e. ranking the hyperlinks and/or
relating it to the works to be linked? Did the link provider realize a financial gain (e.g., ad
revenue)? Is the link provider using a new technical means to provide access to protected
content? Is the link provider the first to provide access to a particular work (e.g., a copy of
film illegally camcorded in a cinema)? Is the source illegal? Our point here is that one needs
to understand the practical effect of the linking, indexing and editorial functions on a given
website, particularly structurally-infringing sites which are facilitating easy access to
unauthorized copies of protected works when making an assessment of whether there has
been a making available to the public.

The parameters of communication to the public have been already largely defined by nine
CJEU verdicts, which are the substantial body of case law, which will be further examined in
the pending Svensson, Bestwater International and C-More Entertainment preliminary
questions, whose verdicts are expected in 2014.

CJEU case law provides a workable and detailed “manual” for answering fact-specific
questions related to when and under what circumstances linking or indeed other technical
operations online amount to a communication to the public. Under such circumstances, no
further legislative action is required.

12.   Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache

memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
A work or other subject matter protected by copyright can only be published with the
authorisation of the rightholder. Only if the rightholder has agreed to the publication and
availability of the work on a web-page and has not reserved his/her rights, its temporary
reproduction in the computer (on the screen and in the cache memory) requires no separate
authorisation by the rightholder. In all other cases, an authorisation of the rightholder is
required for such acts of reproduction.
As a general matter, the exclusive right of reproduction in Article 2 of the Copyright Directive
extends to temporary reproductions. Beyond the actual text of that provision, the Court of
Justice has already confirmed this point (see e.g., FAPL). Subject to the provisions of the
Article 5(1) itself and CJEU’s jurisprudence, national courts should retain the possibility to
consider specific circumstances to determine for example whether or not the exception for
certain temporary copies in Article 5(1) is applicable. There may be cases where the copies on
the screen or in the cache memory are fully covered by Article 5(1). However, in the event
those copies are from illegal sources or whose purpose is to enable an unlawful use (see
Article 5(1) (b)) the exception may not apply. This can be crucial to the application of Article
8(3) where it may be necessary to show that a third party is using an intermediary’s service to
infringe copyright in order to secure injunctive relief. The Court of Justice has already shown
it is fully capable of providing guidance as to when Article 5(1) applies and we would expect
it will continue to do so. It is also worth recalling that Article 5(1) is a mandatory exception.
It therefore represents a fully harmonised provision already somewhat bolstered by CJEU
jurisprudence.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)28. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)29. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

28
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
29
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              18
13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
  NO
Digital files, as many other goods and services, are subject to sale conditions and limitations;
such are not unusual, and should not be considered as restrictions. In fact, the whole
analogical and digital environments are plagued by service terms and conditions, and they are
not usually considered by the Commission as restrictions (i.e. insurances exclusions). We note
that in this case the semantics are not neutral.


14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.


The EU doctrine of exhaustion is well established in the EU Copyright Acquis and has played
an important role in the development of the internal market, and is based on tangible copies
and linked to the distribution right. While the CJEU has provided some further clarification in
the UsedSoft and TV Catchup decisions, the concept of “digital exhaustion” presents radically
different issues that go well beyond tangible copies and the distribution right. Instead, both
the reproduction and making available rights are at issue. The ruling in UsedSoft cannot be
extended directly to making available of other works than computer programs, since it was
issued under the Computer Programs Directive.

The Copyright Directive encourages the development of new online business models by
providing quite clearly that the making available right is not subject to exhaustion and this has
obviously never been the case for the reproduction right. Moreover, as noted above, an
intervention to impose exhaustion would also run contrary to the letter and spirit of Article
6(4) (4) which plays vital role in the development of new on-demand services. Such a
limitation on the scope of these important exclusive rights would clearly violate the three-step
test at EU and international law.

Even if we were to consider that making available could be assimilated to the distribution, the
fact remains that what is occurring is an interactive transmission – there is no transfer of
property (one copy moving from one set of hands to another) but rather a new perfect copy is
made. While physical distribution can said to be exhausted by a first sale, the right of
reproduction is not exhausted after a copy is made and nor is a making available. International
Copyright Treaties (WCT and WPPT) permit Contracting Parties to provide for exhaustion of
the right of distribution30 (for example through international or national exhaustion).
However, these Treaties do not permit exhaustion of the making available or reproduction
rights. Member States are only allowed to introduce exceptions to or limitations on the scope
of exclusive rights that pass the three-step test (see Article 10 WCT, Article 13 TRIPs and
Article 9 Berne). Such a limitation i.e., application of the exhaustion doctrine to either the
reproduction or the making available rights - could hardly be considered a special case (first
condition of the test). Even if would pass this first step, there is clearly a conflict with a
normal exploitation of the works concerned (second step). The normal “distribution” of
content online –through a variety of on-demand services which offer a range of benefits for
consumers would be undermined by unfair competition from the viral “resale” of copied

   30
        See e.g., Article 6(2) of the WCT and the Agreed statement concerning Articles 6 and 7.  

                                                                                                    19
works online. This is particularly the case with recent to works like films the value of which is
diminished after they are “consumed” once. The terms “resale” and “used” really have no
relevance here – we are talking about passing on clones. The impact on the market for films
and other works would be severely damaged. Having failed to pass the second step of the test,
the application of exhaustion here is clearly at odds with international copyright law and we
do not consider the third step.

If the online marketplace is to thrive, rightholders must retain a degree of control and the
ability to new business models based on creative licensing and innovative new offers. Digital
reproductions are not copies – they are perfect clones. The notion that technical fixes can
counteract this is misplaced and likely to cause consumer confusion -- there is no way to
verify and ensure that the untransferred copy is destroyed and indeed the copy is likely to
remain on the hard drive of a user’s computer despite a good faith intention otherwise. A
regime of “digital exhaustion” based on a concept of “forward and delete” is unworkable in
practice. Indeed, digital exhaustion simply has no place in an environment that is increasingly
based on licensing access and cloud based services.

EU rules on exhaustion of the distribution right are clear and apply only to the sale of physical
media, such as CDs or DVDs, not digital copies. In the case of a digital copy, there can never
be any transfer of the copy as such. In the “transfer” of a digital copy, nothing is transferred or
indeed potentially even moved (in the cloud): one party performs a service which changes the
condition of media in the possession of the other. This is a new transmission and a new
copying of the work which must be licensed by the rightholder. The development of “resale”
possibilities for physical goods embodying a copyright work responded to limitations in the
physical world; they are not appropriate or necessary in an online world built on greater
flexibility of use of copyright works. A “digital exhaustion” limitation to the scope of
exclusive rights raises serious questions under EU and international law which; it
expropriating property in this guise raises questions under the EU Charter of Fundamental
Rights and national constitutions.

Beyond the legal framework, the introduction of either an exhaustion or a resale “right”,
would also carry economic consequences, as it would seriously interfere with the primary
market (e.g., for the on-line sale of software, films or music). As a consequence, the "first"
on-line sale would have to become much more expensive for consumers, because the seller
(rightholder) would have to adapt his/her calculation and business model accordingly : such is
the case for instance in the videogame industry (very high prices for new games, and lower
prices for second-hand less popular games). But, as shown in the videogame industry, this
implies a short life-cycle market (sales revenues are concentrated on a limited number of titles
for a couple of months only). Regarding the audiovisual industry, where the market is
organized through “release windows” which enable a much longer life-cycle and already
implement a kind of “second hand” access to audiovisual content organized by rightholders
(the lower the price for consumer, the later the access to audiovisual content), implementing a
framework authorizing systematically the resale of previously purchased digital content
would actually question the very existence of said windows, reducing very significantly the
rightholders’ revenues (confronted with competition from resale of “second hand” digital
products with same features as new) and questioning the financing of new works.




                                                                                                20
C.       Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute31. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered32.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES (Conditional)
The answer to the question should begin taking into account that copyright protection should
not be conditioned to formalities such as previous registration of works and rights, as
provided by International Treaties applicable (notably the Berne Convention)
The term registration is wide enough as to include both the systems whose purpose is
identifying works (registration or identifications of works as ISAN or ISBN) and the systems
aimed to identifying rightholders for purposes related to the exercise of such rights (either
operated by CMOs or private entities). Works identifying registration systems are the
backbone of the rightholders identifying systems, as they allow to managing rights in a time
and cost efficient manner. Both types of registration system do now existing, together with
other which have more specific purposes, either focused on providing knowledge of available
works/rights or for other purposes.
In such sense, most probably the market has reached a near saturation point, which should
lead into improvements in the system, including, to the extent possible, enabling the
interoperability.
In the audiovisual field, the action should be focused in extending the works registration, in
order to increase the knowledge on the existing works and its availability. To that extent we
believe that the Commission should not be a mere spectator, and take steps further to increase
the level of use of the works registration systems. The Media program is an excellent tool to
that extent.
Rights registration systems should be left to the private sector, which has already
implemented solutions (i.e. SAFE CREATIVE), which in an automated way allow
rightholders which decide so, to record their rights and/or also manage them through the tools
made available to them by the registration system operator.


16.      What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]



31
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
32
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             21
A registration system would not provide legal certainty about the copyrightability of the work,
the protectability of the subject matter, the rightholder(s), the transfer of rights, or the duration
of protection, because it would only be of a declaratory nature, and presumably be based on
claims only (establishing a copyright office for verification of the claims would entail high
costs and bureaucracy without any clear added value). In any event, legal certainty about the
above-mentioned features can only be provided by the courts.
On the other hand, as stated in the conclusions of the “Licenses for Europe” exercise (see
pledge #9 mentioned above under Q.15), a European policy supporting implementation of
international identifiers would “help to take audio-visual works out of the digital ‘black hole’
and streamline their distribution and discoverability”. Unlike the idea of a central registry of
rights, and as shown by the broad support to the above mentioned pledge, there is a strong
consensus on the need for audiovisual work identifiers as a key milestone to improve
discoverability, rights clearance and distribution of audiovisual works.


17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]


Leaving aside the possible violation of international obligations assumed by the EU, a central
registration system which enables a claiming party to record its rights is not free from risks
and costs.
Experience shows that registration systems in many countries have been the subject of
significant abuse, usually at the expense of legitimate rightholders. In the absence of robust
fraud detection and a means of constantly updating information to ensure its accuracy and
reliability, such systems can be used to infringe or misappropriate rights. Registration systems
thus always come along with a high risk of misappropriation and/or misuse leading to (wrong
or inaccurate) legal presumptions. A registration system provided of such requirements will
be expensive.
Furthermore, the system would require resource in order to operate reliable robust identifiers
not only for works but also for various rightholders and assignees (authors, producers,
distributors, etc.).
Under these circumstances, we are not in favour of the proposed system. Furthermore, the
Commission should foster the visibility of the existing works registration systems and the


18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]


Rightholders, small and big, are in Europe usually on record/register their rights with one or
several CMOs, depending of the rights to be administered. There is no reason for obliging
rightholders to an additional registration of their rights, if already done. But there is logic to
make existing database more easily manageable, accessible and interoperable, though
common indexes or identifiers. In any case would registration (of works only in our approach)
have to be on cost-recovery bases exclusively.



                                                                                                  22
D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed33, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database34 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition35 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub36 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
As stated above, we see significant merit in continuing to develop “identification systems” for
audiovisual works such as ISAN, which is an open ISO certified standard that addresses a
comprehensive spectrum of audiovisual work types and versions thereof, being able to
allocate a unique identifier to each of them, is cost effective and able to address both large and
small rightholders and volumes of registration, is interoperable with other identifiers (such as
EIDR) and rights registries, notably in Europe (used by CMOs such as EGEDA, AGICOA, or
CISAC member companies). Moreover, there are other rights registration systems, which
together with the resources made available by the CMOs is a consistent supply that perfectly
meets the demand.
The Commission is already well aware of the substantial development of ISAN, the
International Standard Audiovisual Number (www.isan.org). It constitutes a very promising
response and we are encouraged by the support of European Union institutions and media
players, alongside of course any other similarly geared interoperable initiatives such as EIDR
(http://eidr.org/).
The role of the EU should be to encourage such marketplace solutions to become
interoperability norms for rights database, even if necessary through regulatory intervention in
situations where the industry is not structured enough to fully implement such standards.
Given the risk of discrepancies between Member States in their respective efforts for
standardisation, there should be room here for EU intervention in this area.

Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention37 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
It has been confirmed by the courts and legislators that intellectual property is true property
and of equal value as classical property in tangible goods. In spite of such clarity, all forms of
intellectual property with the exceptions of trademarks are limited in time, i.e., has a limited
duration. The fundamentals of this limitation are related to the cultural values of the works,
and the assumption that works in public domain would be far more accessible to the citizens,
especially in terms of price. Until the digital, public domain was an inefficient economic
system. Most of the works were simply not accessible, due to the absence of demand, and
those works that were available were distributed in most of the cases at process in the vicinity
of the protected ones.
Many older works have a very long economic life span: recordings of the Beatles or European
films like those from Fritz Lang or Federico Fellini are still doing very well on the market, all
the more since digital technology preserves them much better than before. The duration of
copyright protection should, therefore, rather be longer in the digital environment, not shorter.
This was the reasoning behind the recent prolongation of the duration of the protection of
sound recordings at EU level or the extension for works in general terms in the USA, with the
so called Sony Bono Act.
The actual difference between the EU and USA maximum terms operates as a disadvantage
for the European audiovisual producers, as US firms shall be monetizing their productions
through longer time periods. Therefore, we understand that in order if not place EU producer
on the same level, the term for the audiovisual recordings should be prolonged for the same
extension that the applicable to the sound recordings.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract




37
     Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.

                                                                                                                 24
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC38.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law39. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)40, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional41, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")42.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory

   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
X NO
Rightholders, as well as users and consumers have lived very well with the catalogue of
exceptions that has been shaped by the copyright Directives and implemented in detail by the
national laws of Member States. Copyright protection, much more than industrial property, is
based on cultural traditions that have grown over time. Each Member State applies limitations
and exceptions to its own needs. To give an example, exceptions for library use are not
needed in Member States with less or no library infrastructure or use; exceptions for
education and teaching purposes may be more needed in Member States without a functioning
network of collecting societies. Said collecting societies can also help adapting existing
exceptions to the actual needs of users (such as it is the case in France through agreements
between CMOs and the Ministry of Education which have actually extended the scope of the
exception).
There is no need to derogate from the principle "as much harmonisation as needed, but as
much flexibility for Member States as possible". Member States are entitled to apply tailor-
made solutions to limitations and exceptions to the rights, i.e., to the balance of rights and
interests that is crucial in the area of copyright. It is obvious that users insist on strong
exceptions and preferably on imposing the respective obligations on Member States via EU
law. However, there are only limited cases, where imposing obligatory limitations/exceptions
on Member States is justified against the principle of subsidiarity. One example is Article 5(1)
of Directive 2001/29.

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
X NO – Please explain
There is no reason nor is there a justification to make any exception mandatory. The principle
of subsidiarity has to be respected. The exceptions that are enshrined in the copyright
Directives (like the obligatory ones in Directive 2009/24 and in Article 5(1) of Directive
2001/29, or the non-obligatory ones) function well in practice (see above on question 21). It is
very important in this respect and has some harmonisation effect that the list of exceptions
contained in Directive 2001/29 is exhaustive, so that Member States are not allowed to
introduce other limitations/exceptions than the ones listed there.
 Nevertheless, considering that one of the exceptions, private copy, has caused so many
interventions of the CJEU, some additional regulation should be considered. Specially in
order to harmonize certain aspects of it that have been perfectly clarified by the Court, such as
the need of a links between the person causing the damage and the person responsible of
paying the compensation.


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
X NO [Open question]


                                                                                              26
There is no need to add or remove limitations and exceptions to/from the existing catalogue.
The existing catalogue reflects a good compromise at EU level. It has been accepted and
continues to be acceptable by all parties. It has always been difficult to reach a compromise:
particular examples are the exceptions in the Software Directive 2009/24 for decompilation
and back-up copying or the exceptions in Directive 2001/29 for private copying, on-site
consultation or technical copies (Article 5(1)).
EU law hence provides for an appropriate (and exhaustive, see above) framework of
limitations and exceptions at EU level. Any necessary adaptations may be applied by national
law within this framework and do not necessitate EU legislation. The European Court of
Justice is the appropriate institution to safeguard compliance of national law in this respect
with EU law.
Except the harmonization in a very limited aspect of the private copy, already established by
the EU case law, modifying the CJEU framework for such adaptations is neither necessary
nor worth the while. Moreover, any attempts of doing so would only risk opening up
Pandora's box, tilting the delicate balance of rights and other interests enshrined in the
Directives, and not respecting the international law obligations of the relevant treaties (Berne
Convention, WCT, WPPT and TRIPs Agreement).

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  NO – Please explain why
Providing Member States with more flexibility on limitations and exceptions is not necessary
because, as is rightly stated in Section III above, they already enjoy a sufficient degree of
flexibility; nor would it be appropriate in view of the functioning of the Internal Market. For
this reason, the list limitations/exceptions contained in Directive 2001/29 is exhaustive and
does not allow Member States to introduce others.
Providing users with more flexibility would risk modifying the balance of rights and interests
enshrined in the Directives. It would potentially reduce the level of protection, and by
consequence risk being in violation of the Directives and international obligations, notably the
three-steps-test (Article 5(5) of Directive 2001/29; Article 10 WCT, Article 16 WPPT).
When discussing the issue it has appear with some frequency the mention to the concept of
"fair use" or "fair dealing". Such institution is alien to the EU Directives and has no basis in
international copyright law. The two so-called "Internet Treaties" WCT and WPPT of 1996
already provide for appropriate solutions for the protection of copyright in the new digital
environment and have deliberately not adopted this concept. In our view, it must not be
adopted in EU law, as, again, it is contrary to the three-steps-test.
Furthermore, even an authority such as the Registrar of Copyrights at the US Copyright
Office has recently pointed that «While fair use can also be helpful to users of copyrighted
works in appropriately tailored circumstances, it requires an intensive application of the facts
at hand and is therefore ill suited as a vehicle for bright line rules or more systematic
activities of users.”43
This statement was given in the context of the US legal system which operates in a very
different manner than that of the EU – including even common law jurisdictions such the UK




                                                                                             27
and Ireland. We note that the jurisprudence underpinning fair use goes back to 184144. Within
the European Union, we have the 3-step test and the CJEU along with specific optional
exceptions which provide flexibility for each Member States concerning their implementation
together with a degree of legal certainty. The balance inherent in this system nurtures both
innovation and protection Additionally, we would like to recall that it was not fair use that
spawned US internet behemoths (which have a much larger market share in Europe than in
the US45). Copyright played a very small role in their development (indeed many of them rely
on IP) – instead it was range of other factors, such as tax incentives and the gathering of
several people with creative minds and the readiness to take the risk to believe in their ideas
and to invest into them.
Flexibility, in any event, is not a shield or excuse for third parties to freeload and run
businesses based on the exploitation of copyright works of others without having to obtain
licenses (i.e., for free). In the field of online search and social networks, which has
experienced massive, if in some cases concentrated, growth in the EU, it should be noted no
judicial decisions have undermined, let alone prevented, core search activities. The EU legal
framework, including the Copyright and the E-Commerce Directives, has provided sufficient
scope to allow search companies and platforms to thrive without specific regulation.

Given the breathing room afforded Member States by the current system, where national
copyright systems and the Copyright Directive coexist and are underpinned by the
jurisprudence of the CJEU and the 3-step test, there appears to be a more than sufficient
amount of margin to manoeuvre and accommodate developments in technology, new uses and
changing consumer demand.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
     NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
Territoriality does not constitute a problem regarding the substance of the limitations and
exceptions. True, in theory, limitations and exceptions, as well as the rights that they refer to,
are shaped in detail by the national legislator and apply only within its jurisdiction. In
practice, however, there are not too many differences between Member States in this respect,

  See e.g., http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/eu-ups-pressure-google-antitrust-case-21539804 which
notes that “[Google]” has a market share of about 90 percent of Internet searches in Europe, compared with
around 70 percent in the U.S.”

                                                                                                        28
especially not in the digital environment where basically very similar, if not the same,
limitations and exceptions apply (for example, for technical copies, private use, education and
teaching). In this respect, applying the three-steps-test has had a harmonising effect, too.
Territoriality does not constitute a problem, either, for the management of rights/limitations
and exceptions. Many exceptions, in particular remuneration rights, are centrally managed by
collecting societies that have cross-licensing agreements with sister societies and function as a
one-stop-shop for a broad range of repertoire. Moreover, these societies increasingly manage
the rights together with clearing organisations that operate on a multi-territorial level.
In the event that current exceptions were to apply cross-border, this could lead to the
imposition of the respective exception of one Member State in another – although that
Member State may not have implemented the exception or limitation or may have
implemented in a narrower manner. In such a case, the exception in question would cross the
border and “override” the copyright law of the country where protection is sought.
At this stage, the Commission has not presented any evidence or an impact assessment which
would justify extending the reach of exceptions and limitations established at a national level
beyond their borders.

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

The copyright regulation of each Member State has effects that are confined to the territory of
said State. Therefore, limitations and exceptions established at national level have only
national effect. Consequently, equitable remuneration or fair compensation is only due for
private copying, public performance, public lending, etc., if the relevant acts take place in the
jurisdiction in question. In respect of private copy the ECJ ruling of July 11th, 2011
(Opus/Thuiskopie) is certainly clear to that extent: compensation is due and payable in the
Member State where the damage is produced. And there is no reason to change the reasoning
and application in other exceptions or limitations, so there is no "cross-border" effect.

At present, such remuneration rights are not granted by the EU Directives: the Directives
harmonise these rights to some extent, but the latter are granted by national law. If, in the
future, EU law should grant these rights directly (e.g., through a Regulation), they would still
have to be managed and the remuneration be collected by the collecting society in charge
depending on where the relevant acts take place.

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving46 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions47. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive48.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.     Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
X NO

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

31.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS 28 to 31:
We are NOT aware of problems related to the use of the preservation exception for the
preservation purposes. Producers and other rightholders are deeply committed to the
preservation of Europe’s film heritage and to providing access to it for cultural, educational
and research purposes.

                                                                                           30
Collection of films are available by way of legal (mandatory) deposit rules or under voluntary
deposit arrangements with film heritage institutions – where there is a need to preserve these
materials the institutions in question can either rely on the relevant exception or have recourse
to the rightholders. In this regard, we would notably like to draw attention to the framework
agreement on voluntary deposit with film heritage institutions, which FIAPF (International
Federation of Film Producers Association) entered into already in 1972, and which was
recently updated to take into account the digital environment.
We are also fully supportive of more current endeavours including the work on audiovisual
heritage in the context of “Licenses for Europe” (WG3). We note also the important role of
the recently adopted Orphan Works Directive. Indeed, that Directive, Article 5(2) (c) and
national implementations thereof operate on the basis of a clear distinction between, on the
one hand, conditions that are needed to ensure that public bodies entrusted with the public
interest missions are provided with the required legal certainty to fulfil their responsibilities
and, on the other hand, processes and practices that might go beyond these public interest
missions. In this context, we recognise archives and film heritage institutions are interested in
embracing digitisation including by digitising their archives, making them available online
and projecting them in digital format in their cinematheques. Such institutions’ activities
should not go beyond their public interest mission of collecting, cataloguing, preserving,
restoring and making accessible for educational, cultural, research or other non-commercial
uses cinematographic and other audiovisual works. Where they do go beyond this mission,
then licensing will be relevant as there is a risk of other conflicting with the normal
exploitation of works in the sector. That said, the audiovisual sector is encouraged by the
work that stakeholder platforms, achieve (see above reference to the most recent work of the
WG3 of the License for Europe process), which encourage contractual arrangements between
rightholders and users for the implementation of copyright exceptions, are very useful to
further concrete solutions between stakeholders.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?

                                                                                              31

35.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS 32-35
We have serious concerns about a possible extension of Article 5(3) (n) off the premises of
libraries and archives. We believe such arrangements should be left to licensing so that they
can address a host of important questions including robust means of ensuring that only
intended beneficiaries have access and the use of technological measures to prevent leakage
of protected works online. An exception that applied online and permitted remote access to
protected works would risk conflicting with the normal exploitation of works by on-demand
services online.


3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?




                                                                                             32
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain with specific examples

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

39.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
Making available portals and broadcasters, commercial and non commercial, already perform
a sort of e-lending via VOD options which, in general terms are a sufficient supply for the
market demand. Beyond that, several different initiatives are making available a wide array of
films, including non commercially available production. New businesses are developing in
this area, introducing innovative business and technological systems, focused in elevating the
accessibility and the levels of usability. We see no reason of introducing new partners in the
supply side, in many cases at public funds expense, to meet a demand already satisfied.
Furthermore, this type of services shall have to face the weak demand other online services
are facing and that we had exposed above.

39 Mass digitisation


The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with

                                                                                                33
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other49. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)50.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
X NO
The term “works out of commerce” is not applicable to audiovisual works. Unlike other type
of creations, they have available several different exploitation channels or windows: theatres,
DVD and other physical devices, over a dozen of broadcasting possibilities (including i.e.
broadcast carried VOD and NVOD) and on line exploitation that subsequently widen the
availability of the film productions.


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
X NO – see 40 above

B.      Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC51 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from

49
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
50
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
X NO

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Rightholders have developed different business models (via collecting societies and/or niche
markets specialized distributors) which allow the use of the films and other audiovisual works
in educational institutions.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
See 43.


45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?

46.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC52 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?

X NO


48.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?

Actually the market provides commercial solutions to researches when required to use of
works beyond the established exceptions.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC53 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 54.

The Marrakesh Treaty55 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?
X NO

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics56 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”57. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?


56
  For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
X NO –
Data mining affects directly to the reproduction right, therefore certain uses are authorized in
the scope of the existing exceptions (private copy should it be for private uses or research
exception if it is for such purpose). Commercial data mining, which implies the use of
excerpts or clips from films and other audiovisual productions, and which is a for profit
activity, has to be subject to license. In fact, certain operators (such as broadcasters and
producers) are actually and regularly obtaining reproduction licenses for clipping and similar
activities. Thus the market has already provided an effective solution. Furthermore, those
licenses are a revenue stream for rightholders.

F.     User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
                                                                                             38
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs58. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions59.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
     YES
User Generated Content (UGC) is the re-use of pre-existing audiovisual material (generally
clips of image and sound) which is used, normally together with other creative materials to
produce a derivative visual or audiovisual work. These activities, when carried out by
commercial operators, are subject to the required licenses, and it is not infrequent to watch
either in theatres or television audiovisual works that reproduce clips from other works.
The performance of those activities for creative purposes, as it should be attributed/presumed
to the process, when carried out by natural persons for non commercial purposes could be
inserted in the private copy exception. Nevertheless, when those works transcend the limited

   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

personal space afforded by the private copy exception, and are made available to the public,
they are crossing the border of the private copy, and cannot be sheltered in the exception.
Furthermore, this act also contravenes another of the principles of the three steps test, as it an
act that causes damage to the rightholders. Not to mention that also the third principle is
contravened, as it conflicts with the normal exploitation of the works.


59.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient
in this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that
are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?
X YES
Only to (b)
It is an audiovisual industry standard in the EU that the audiovisual works and recordings
count with a double identification: in the initial credits and in the last photogram under the (c)
sign. Nevertheless, the use of other type of embedded data (i.e. metadata, ISAN number) in
the digital recordings should be encouraged to obtain a more accurate identification of the
work.


60.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you
experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for
users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service?
X YES
(a) Before examining further the matter, it should be taken into account that in the UGCs not
only economic rights are involved; moral rights are part of the issue. In most of the EU
member States authors’ moral rights are acknowledged; amongst such rights is integrity and
the right to oppose any modification that may damage her/his interests.
Furthermore, when UGC is created with the intention of a further communication to the
public, reproduction and public performance rights are involved, and require authorization.
(b) EGEDA licenses on a regular basis, and for over five years now, clips of audiovisual
works and recordings on a one by one license.


61.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
There is little, if any, cooperation from the intermediaries at the time to deal with UGCs made
available without respecting the moral and economic rights of the authors.

62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
The regulatory tools are available. Awareness and education initiatives, together with a more
proactive attitude of the intermediaries and ADR systems with simplified electronic
proceedings, shall produce better results than simply increasing the number of legal rules
applicable.

     IV.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying60. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees6162.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions63 in the digital environment?
X YES

In general terms, the 2001/29/CE Directive together with the different rulings of the ECJ are,
in general terms, sufficient. Nevertheless, the principle that the compensation has to be
financed by the same persons making the copies should be clearly established.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?64
     YES
The ECJ case law has already established the scope of the private copy exception in this point.
The June 26th 2013 ruling has clearly established that any authorizing act of the rightholders is
devoid of effects, should the relevant Member State had established a private copy exception.
Of course that case law may be changed by a legislative act, but it shall immediately raise
concerns in respect of a respectful separation of powers.
Establishing by an act of law that in certain circumstances copies made in the context of
legislation that, via the private copy exception, deprives authors to exercise their exclusive
reproduction right once that the ECJ has made clear the contrary, shall most likely raise the
same concerns.
66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
First of all, that the expression “new business models” is inadequate. The essence of the
business developed around the technological media that enable consumers to easily copy
works with the assistance of an electromechanical device dates back to the late1950s, when
open reel recorders were marketed to the general public. From then on the business model has
remained the same (selling as many devices as possible); what have changed are the devices.
Even the services that allow consumers to commission the recording of a work exist from
time ago.
The experience shows that since the compensation was first established in Germany in the
mid 60s, it has not had any impact in the development of reproduction business; the reality is
that the initiative of making available to the consumers devices that allow them to copy in an
easier, faster and more productive fashion has fostered the habit of copying. To the extent that
nowadays many consumers have copied and stored books, musical and audiovisual works by
the thousands and even beyond that figure.
The introduction of the compensation in certain Member States has not influenced the market
at all, to the extent that (as the Castex Report states) it has not altered the prize levels both
when established or withdrawn. The case of Spain is relevant to that extent: the suppression of
the compensation has not reduced the sale prize of the affected devices.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?65

65
   This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                           42
X YES
To the extent that the compensation is paid by the consumer, for transparency sake consumer
should know which is the price paid by the creative content in the services they’re provided. It
will also evidence which is the cost of the other elements of the price paid for a product or
service.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments66.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
X NO
In copyright terms, the mention to goods is restricted to the physical devices that either
contains the recording/reproduction of a work, or that allow to reproduce one or more works.
In the first case, the compensation to authors and performers is paid when and where the
recording is made or first made available to the public. Free circulation of goods and
exhaustion of the distribution right prevent further payments. In the second case, according to
the July 11th, 2011, ECJ ruling, payment of the compensation is due only where the copies are
made. And once the payment is made, if the devices are later resell in another Member State,
transborder distributor may recoup the compensation first paid.

Therefore, there is no obstacle or double payment in the case of the goods.

In the case of the services, the situation is similar. When a film is shown on a theatre, levy
payment is collected by the local collecting society, and when exhibited in another Member
State the same applies. Being thus the principle the territorial payment. And as the same
service (broadcast, television, VOD) cannot be rendered to a consumer and later the same to
another in another territory (or in the same territory), no such double payment may happen.
The essence of the communication to the public is that the works are offered at once to a
certain number of users, and each of them consumes the content offered at once. To make it
even clearer, the same wave (or digital package) cannot be used twice or more.

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
The question is clearly rooted in the Padawan ruling of the ECJ, but it has omitted one
essential element of it, and it is that such ruling requires that said “products” have not been
made available to private users. As long as those “products” are made available to the general
public, they follow outside of the scope of the ruling.

66
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                          43
The ruling only excludes the devices that meet the three conditions, and in that sense, except
in the field of the reprography and in certain areas of the informatics (i.e. servers), most of the
devices are not restricted from being made available to the public in general.

70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?
Since most of the most consumed devices admit double use, it is difficult, if not impossible, to
advance a percentage, except as a guess.
A priori exemptions should only be applied to devices which clearly are not made available to
the public and devoted to either license copying or copying other than works. Ex post
reimbursement schemes should be made available when and if the three Padawan conditions
are meeting after the devices are made available (i.e. hard disk for surveillance recordings.


71.If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system,
how would these problems best be solved?
Although they remain characterised by a high degree of subsidiarity and national specificities, as
allowed under the 2001 Copyright Directive and reaffirmed by CJEU “Padawan” ruling, there are no
real issues with the current functioning of the various levy systems in Europe other than the clear
whish of those who pay said levies to phase them out and ultimately be exempted from their payment.
Rightholders’ organisations on their part have proven during the various stakeholder dialogues (2008-
2009 and then again in 2012) that they were willing to study ways to make the system more
transparent (see notably Q. 67 above about the visible fee) as well as more understandable for all
parties involved (notably by working on a harmonised list of products eligible to such levies). The
remaining issues are up to the negotiation and/or the Member States to be resolved.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers67 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract68. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

contracts)?

address the shortcomings you identify?

     VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE69 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text70. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose71. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure72. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

74.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     NO –
The actual acquis, and specially Directive 2004/48 provide remedies adequate for said
purposes.
     NO OPINION

75.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
Intermediaries should increase the level of cooperation with rightholders in order to curb
illegal commercial activities. At least with the same readiness and willingness evidenced in
defending their own intellectual property.

of intellectual property rights.

   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
72
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           45
76.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  NO – Please explain
Personal data protection is often a limit which precludes copyright holders to have access to
receive court protection of their interests. Promusicae ECJ ruling evidenced that there is a red
line, drawn by the persona data protection that documents such preclusion.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

77.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
X NO
The diversity of cultural and legal traditions of the Member States will certainly preclude the
Union to reach a unitary copyright title.
Nonetheless, considering the differences in the results reached when transposing directives,
there are certain areas or principles that are common, and may integrate a regulation that
could later expand, in the measure that certain cultural and legal principles become common.


78.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
First step should be analyzing/identifying common principles and institutions and use this as a
starting point.
