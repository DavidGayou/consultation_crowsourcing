IV.         Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying1. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees23.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

      64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
      the private copying and reprography exceptions4 in the digital environment?
    YES – Please explain
We would like to draw your attention to an aspect which has not been addressed yet.
In the context of a review of the Copyright Directive, there is a need to clarify that
industrial/professional printing machines should not be considered as a device subject to a
copyright levy. Industrial printing machines are equipment used by printing companies; this
equipment has to be differentiated from the equipment used by individuals or offices. A
printing company typically has different types of equipment (called presses), including digital
printing machines enabling to print from a digital-based image to paper or other substrates.
These professional printing machines are not used by individuals for private copying but for
professional use under a contract with a customer. Customers of printing companies are either
rightholders (authors) or have already paid their compensation to the rightholder (example:
for the re-printing of a book, the publisher who is the customer of the printing company would
initially pay copyright fees to the rightholder). Imposing an ‘operator levy’ on printing
companies could on one hand potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies
could be claimed on top of licence fees. On the other hand it implies higher printing costs for

  These issues were addressed in the recommendations of Mr António Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies. You can consult these recommendations on the following website:

customers, ie authors, publishers. In this case, the levy has the opposite effect to that intended
as it ultimately punishes rightholders.
The fact that industrial printing machines are not included in the levies for private copying or
reprography has to be clearly stipulated in the Directive for reasons of legal certainty and
legal harmonisation in the EU.


     67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
     subject to levies?5
    YES – Please explain

Making levies visible on invoices, in our specific case on invoices issued by printers, would
make the possible double payment made by authors and publishers transparent (see answer to
question 21). Double payment would occur if reprography levies are claimed in addition to
the original licence fee. Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single
Market. At the same time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate
application of private copying levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the
product subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all
Member States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could
remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments6.

     68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
     undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the
     free movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.
As explained in our answer to question 21, the duplication of levy payments would occur in
the case of a publisher who is paying both its compensation to the rightholder (licence fees)
and the levy in the printing costs of its publication.
As stated in question 21, it is key to ensure that professional (industrial) printing machines are
not considered as device subject to a reprography levy as it would further deteriorate the
economic situation of the European printing sector. A large proportion of European books are
already printed outside Europe because of lower production costs. Imposing further financial
burden on European printing companies will further increase the competitive advantage of
non-European printing companies. It is crucial to preserve the high cultural value of printed
products in Europe.
Moreover any levy (in particular an ‘operator levy’) imposed on printing companies in a
differentiated way across Member States would significantly distort the European printing
market and create an obstacle to the free movement of printed products. The levy would
artificially make some printed products more expensive in some Member States compared to
others.
