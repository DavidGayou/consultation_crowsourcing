BBC response to the European Commission
‘Public Consultation on the Review of the
EU Copyright Rules’

March 2014




                                            3
Overview

The BBC welcomes this consultation and the opportunity to contribute further to the Commission’s
copyright review.

The BBC takes a broad view of the copyright debate, given its dual role as a major rights holder and
a major rights user. We would begin by making two high level points.

Firstly, the EU’s robust copyright regime is crucial to the creative industries’ contribution to
economic growth, including by the BBC. The BBC’s primary public service activity results in spend of
around £2.4 billion per annum on original content, of which around £1 billion comprises payments to
rights holders. In 2011/12, overall licence fee spending generated over £8 billion of economic value
or at least £2 of economic value for each pound of the licence fee1.

The BBC’s wholly owned commercial subsidiary, BBC Worldwide, also contributes substantially to
the success of the European creative industries. It has invested over £1 billion in the UK’s creative
sector over the past 5 years and created £947 million GVA for the UK economy in 2011/12,
excluding joint ventures, returning £91 million to independent rights holders through upfront rights
investment, profit share and royalties.

Equally importantly, the copyright regime enables us to deliver substantial cultural and social benefits.
The BBC offers audiences high quality, diverse and original public service content that informs,
educates and entertains. This includes programmes and services that reflect the UK’s regional and
national cultures and languages, as well as familiarising many UK audiences with viewpoints from
across the rest of Europe through co-productions and acquisitions such as RAI’s ‘Inspector
Montalbano’, or Sky Entertainment’s ‘Salamander’ (Belgium). Meanwhile, BBC Films works with major
international and UK distributors to co-produce British films with range and ambition.

This leads us to consider what it is about the EU copyright regime – with its balance of EU
framework, national legislation and industry-led initiatives – that has helped to make the European
creative industries in many ways a global success story.

Drawing on our experience of public service broadcasting, production and distribution, we propose
that an effective regime will feature the following principles and aims:

       •   Policy objectives anchored in a comprehensive evidence base

       •   Robust protection to incentivise and reward creativity and innovation in content and
           services, which generate cultural, social and economic benefits

       •   Simple and efficient copyright clearance processes to facilitate licensing

       •   Full recognition of the distinctive social, cultural and economic characteristics of creative
           content and services

       •   Consideration of the whole value chain involved in content creation, distribution and use,
           including the role of intermediaries

       •   Subsidiarity: a carefully struck balance in EU legislation between harmonisation (for significant
           variances in national law that would cause legal uncertainty and hinder the single market) and

                                                                                                           4
        providing a general, flexible framework for national legislation (which can be more responsive
        to cultural and market specificities)

    •   Proportionality: a bias against intervention, promotion of the least intrusive action, and
        prioritising industry-led solutions wherever feasible

    •   Consumers who are adequately informed about their rights and responsibilities, both as end-
        users and as creators themselves

Having examined the evidence available to us, overall we find that the existing EU copyright regime
successfully delivers the above principles. There are many practical examples of the results, including:

     • Cross-border production and distribution: current flexibility in the territorial scope of
       licensing enables the BBC to assemble production funding with international partners, such
       as for the ‘Africa’ documentary and ‘Parade’s End’ literary adaptation, subsequently
       distributed to 55 and 72 territories respectively. BBC Worldwide simultaneously released
       the 50th Anniversary episode of Dr Who ‘The Day of the Doctor’ on TV in over 75
       countries and in over 400 cinemas in 18 countries.

     • Service innovation: BBC Worldwide offers the Global iPlayer, a pilot online subscription
        service with over 2,000 hours of ‘Best of British’ programmes and currently available in 13
        EU countries plus Switzerland, Australia and Canada. The public service BBC iPlayer,
        available to licence fee payers in the UK, streams or downloads almost 3 billion TV and
        radio programme requests a year, stimulating demand for broadband and mobile. We plan a
        BBC-branded storefront ‘BBC Store’, selling digital copies of BBC programmes for audiences
        to buy and keep

     • A flexible legislative framework: the UK IPO has recently carried out a comprehensive
       review of the UK system resulting in a legislative framework for extended collective
       licensing to facilitate archive release, and amended exceptions to reflect the emergence of
       digital content, e.g. for parody and quotation, or exceptions for people with disabilities

     • Industry-led initiatives: volume licensing agreements between third party platforms and rights
        holders regarding user-generated content; the Licences for Europe ‘Ten pledges to bring
        more content online’; and the UK Copyright Hub, set up to help copyright users and
        individual creators to understand and navigate the licensing system

     • Copyright awareness: initiatives and funding from industry including BBC, Member States
       (including the UK Intellectual Property Office, IPO) and the European Commission

Given the examples of success outlined above, is there a risk of jeopardy from intervention,
particularly where this is legislative in nature?

We will now turn to the detail of the regime, and address further the question of territoriality and
cross-border services mentioned above.

In particular, we are strongly concerned that disrupting the current flexibility to offer or acquire
licences and services on a territorial basis (whether single territory, multi-territory or pan-EU) would
risk: (i) undermining the financial viability of original EU production, including for content that reflects
the national and regional diversity of Europe’s languages and cultures; and (ii) preventing services



                                                                                                          5
from being tailored to local preferences. In fact, territoriality underpins the business models making
the launch and development of European VOD services (and linear channels) possible.

Reasons for tailoring licensing and services to markets include:

    •     Assembling production funding (pre-sales use an assessment of the likely returns on a
          territorial basis to reflect the locations, periods and platforms of maximum audience demand;
          the ability to offer exclusivity gives greater funding security, making projects viable)

    •     Efficiency (not wasting resources, including public funds, on distribution where there is
          insufficient demand)

    •     Value maximisation (which also allows newer or smaller entrants to acquire licences to less
          well-known content in their territory)

    •     Cultural sensitivities (content standards and classification; marketing approach)

    •     Appeal of different genres to different cultures (from the Global iPlayer pilot, we see a
          marked preference by country e.g. for crime thrillers (France), documentaries (Spain and
          Portugal) or Dr Who (Nordics))

    •     Differential pricing (reflecting willingness and ability to pay)

    •     Regulatory obligations (BBC licence fee spend is primarily for UK users; we reflect our public
          service/ commercial funding split by redirecting audiences to the appropriate website)

    •     Broader legal compliance, such as different libel laws

All of these reasons apply to both public service and commercial broadcasters. This is not just the
approach of the BBC and other EU actors – it’s also the approach taken by ex-EU over-the-top
(OTT) services provided by Google, Amazon and Apple. And this is not only a theoretical position; it
is confirmed by the market testing of an editorially untailored offer by BBC Worldwide via the
Global iPlayer. Specialist and culturally diverse content would be at particular risk should legislative
intervention remove the existing flexibility to choose territorial scope.

We would also highlight the following points from our response:

    -­‐   Digital resale: we strongly believe that legislative intervention would have unintended
          consequences for the availability of content and services on a download-to-own basis,
          pushing providers to favour services that avoid ‘first sale’ such as cloud streaming and
          temporary DRM downloads, reducing consumer choice in an area of emerging business
          models. It is vital that the fundamental differences between physical and digital copies are not
          underestimated by policy makers. Digital copies are perfect, meaning they enter into direct
          competition with the original but without the (third party) resale platform returning any
          rewards for the original creation to the content producer; it would be in many cases
          impossible to verify deletion of the original file; infringing files could be laundered. Licensing is
          the appropriate tool. It is also important that end-users are able to easily understand the
          different functionality and rights that come with physical and download-to-own digital files, to
          support informed purchasing decisions

    -­‐   Exceptions: the current EU framework strikes a good balance between harmonisation in the
          single market and allowing Member States enough flexibility to cope with technology

                                                                                                             6
        developments. We do not have any evidence of need for reform at the EU level. We would
        be strongly concerned by a proposal to introduce ‘fair use’ in the EU. It is unnecessary given
        the tools already available to Member States, including ‘fair dealing’. Decades of case law has
        been necessary in the US and it still falls to experts to advise on its application, meaning it
        would do nothing for transparency and certainty, for broadcasters or consumers

We have given equal consideration to whether further benefits could be provided by reform,
whether legislative or non-legislative and at EU or Member State level. In the course of our response,
and mindful of the principles above, we have identified some targeted areas:

    •   Non-legislative measures by the European Commission could help address some commercial
        barriers to the development of online services particularly for small and independent
        entrants, e.g. language versioning and encoding costs, and access to local market data

    •   Some national legislative approaches allow the private copying exception to be exploited by
        commercial platform operators for recording programmes without the broadcaster’s
        authorisation, and contrary to its intended application to individuals for private use and non-
        commercial ends. Member States can address this under the current EU legislative
        framework, but it may be that EU-level guidance would prove helpful (such as an interpretive
        communication). Licensing is the solution for such services

    •   Presuming that the current approach to territoriality remains robust, and should policy
        makers decide to open the EU legislative framework for review, extending the ‘country of
        origin’ principle applied to clearance for satellite distribution to the online platform merits
        further evaluation. While it has the potential to streamline the process of licensing for
        broadcaster services, supporting the circulation of audiovisual works in the EU, the costs and
        benefits for all stakeholders would need careful analysis. It would also be appropriate to
        consider the implications of this principle for determining the applicable law and jurisdiction
        for civil enforcement actions

In conclusion, we consider that the EU copyright regime has served the audiovisual sector and our
audiences well. It is appropriate to review policy and legislation in light of technology, market and
consumer developments. In this case, having carefully examined the evidence of our own experiences
in the UK and across the EU, we do not find that there is a need for particular reform of the EU
legislative framework itself. This is testament to the robustness and foresight of the regime agreed a
decade ago, and the balance struck between harmonisation and flexibility. If a need for legislative
change is found, this may be most efficiently addressed though subject-specific and targeted
instruments, as we have seen with the Orphan Works Directive and Collective Rights Management
Directive. Non-legislative measures, continued voluntary industry action, and copyright education,
should have an important role in any review.

The BBC is a member of the British Screen Advisory Council (BSAC) and the European Broadcasting
Union (EBU). We have contributed to their responses to this Consultation, and directly refer to
some of their answers below. We have limited our longer responses to questions where we would
like to contribute particular points to the debate, based on the BBC’s practical experience.

BBC Response to relevant Consultation Questions



Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

2.     [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when
seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?

YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to
copyright or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing
services across borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)?
Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-
visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers,
games, applications and other software).

NO

The BBC has not experienced any meaningful problems related to the EU copyright framework.

Providers target online services by Member State or region for many positive reasons. As we explain
further in our response to question 6, territoriality underpins the business models making the launch
and development of European VOD services (and linear channels) possible. Providers must have
regard to, inter alia: the size of potential audience to justify distribution and marketing costs;
audiences favour services with targeted content, presentation and marketing that reflect local tastes
and sensitivities; and different price points linked to the national cost of living. Specialist content
would be at particular risk should legislative intervention remove the existing flexibility to choose
whether to make a single-, multi-territory or pan-EU offer.

On the other hand, there are some commercial barriers to the development of online services that
are not related to rights, e.g. language versioning and encoding costs and access to local knowledge
and contacts to support market entry and promotion. The Commission might usefully help with
practical measures in a non-legislative role.

Lastly we would make the general point that within the creative industries, the audiovisual sector has
distinctive characteristics and underlying business models. Separate research and policy decisions are
required for each sector.



4.    If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above –
what would be the best way to tackle them?

    [Open question]

We have not identified any problems in the EU copyright framework. We refer to the British Screen
Advisory Council (BSAC)2 responses to questions 3 – 7.

                                                                                                       8
5.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there
reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose
territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that
access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?

YES

Please see our answer to question 6, as the same considerations apply.



6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why, even in
cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions
on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different
website than the one he is trying to access?)

YES

The following answer draws on our practical experience of audiovisual rights and licensing from BBC
Television, BBC Films and BBC Worldwide in particular.

On the evidence, the territoriality of rights is not a barrier to the provision of cross-border services,
and is not a notable reason why, as a major rights holder, broadcaster and distributor, we may
choose to offer or seek licences on a territorial basis and impose corresponding restrictions on a
service. We do not consider that a legislative change to the EU copyright framework is necessary in
this respect.

The BBC is a strong supporter of the digital single market and the Commission’s Digital Agenda. We
consider that this is fully compatible with preserving the current flexibility around the territorial
scope of licences and services (whether single territory, multi-territory or pan-EU). Disrupting this
flexibility by legislative intervention would risk:

      i) Undermining the financial viability of original EU production, including for content that
      reflects the national and regional diversity of Europe’s languages and cultures; and

      ii) Preventing services from being tailored to local preferences, which our experience
      demonstrates is necessary to meet audience needs and expectations

We would firstly like to comment on production funding. Complex factors determine if, how and
when content is available on a cross-border or multi-territory basis. As explained in the BSAC
response to this consultation and in its contribution to Licences for Europe,3 assembling funding for
European films and high quality television productions is challenging and inextricably linked to
flexibility around territoriality. In particular, it relies on multiple co-producers and distributors and a
patchwork of public funds, plus some private investment, from across different countries. For TV,
this is especially true for sports, drama and documentaries, which public service broadcasters (PSBs)

play an essential role in bringing to audiences and BBC Worldwide exports across Europe and
beyond. ‘Parade’s End’, adapted by playwright Sir Tom Stoppard from the novels of Ford Madox
Ford, was funded by several international producers, European soft funds, and European equity
investment4. The documentary ‘Africa’, which captured aspects of the continent’s wildlife on film for
the first time using the latest in HD technology, was co-produced by the BBC, BBC Worldwide,
France Télévisions, The Discovery Channel and CCTV-9. BBC Worldwide distributed Parade’s End
and Africa to 55 and 72 countries respectively.

It is telling that for pre-sales of rights5, both distributors and banks assess the likely future revenues
of a production according to audience demand and costs for a given territory. It is essential to have
flexibility in agreements to reflect the locations, periods and platforms of maximum audience
demand. This may include other planned film releases or TV broadcasts, wider cultural events, and
the relative development of different distribution channels such as free to air broadcasting and pay
TV; subscription, transactional and ad-funded VOD; and DVDs6. An exclusive agreement gives much
greater funding security, helping projects to be viable.

Moreover, it is this flexibility that allows producers and distributors to experiment with different
release combinations in a way that balances financing demands with the opportunities afforded by
new technologies and with evolving audience expectations. The 50th Anniversary episode of BBC
Drama’s Dr Who ‘The Day of the Doctor’ was shown as a global TV simulcast in over 75 countries
and in over 400 cinemas in 18 countries7. We can also see the first and second pay windows blurring,
and ‘reverse windowing’ or simultaneous release, such as simultaneous theatrical and transactional
VOD release by Magnolia Pictures.

Underlying the above considerations are the distinctive economic qualities of audiovisual content. In
particular, most resources are invested in the initial production, with an insignificant marginal cost
per unit for reproduction. This is a high-risk market with low demand predictability; short product
lifecycles; low substitutability; and a short, focused marketing burst at time of launch. While for most
products the socially optimal price is held to be its marginal cost, it would be impossible to recover
film and programme production costs on this basis. Doing so requires differential pricing, which is
recognised and enabled through the copyright and licensing regime, including the ability to choose to
licence and offer services on different territorial bases.

This brings us to our second point. The BBC’s experience demonstrates that services are available
on a cross-border or multi-territory basis according to consumer demand and the corresponding
market opportunity. While BBC Worldwide experiments with different distribution approaches, we
often launch by country basis according to: willingness and ability to pay (average spend stretches
from €24.5/year/consumer in Greece to €164.5 in Denmark for subscription VOD8); marketing style
and focus (for BBC Film’s Tamara Drew, images of a mistress were appropriate in some Member
States and not others); choice of content (we would expect BBC Film’s Mrs Brown D’Movie to
appeal most in Anglophone markets); cultural sensitivities and classification around content
standards; other legislative differences e.g. around libel; the need for language versioning; access to

5 Pre-selling rights to distributors is essential to secure ‘minimum guarantees’ that can be used as collateral for bank loans.
6 For example, staggering by territory allows promotional resources to be focused in the necessary marketing ‘burst’

characteristic of audiovisual services, such as around film festivals (see BBC Films co-production Bright Star
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810784/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt).

local market information and contacts. Independent research finds that demand for cross-border
services is low overall and willingness to pay lower still9.

An important case study is BBC Worldwide’s Global iPlayer, a pilot subscription VOD service
offering ‘Best of British’ programmes in 13 EU countries, plus Switzerland, Australia and Canada.
Because of the practical limitations of a trial, it is the same service in terms of presentation and price
across the countries where it is offered, and there is no editorial curation of content by territory.
Our research fully supports the finding that audiences would in fact prefer services that are curated
for their national or regional culture and market. There are differences in genre consumption that
are attributable to local tastes: contemporary drama and crime thrillers perform well in France while
factual content is relatively under-represented; Spain and Portugal strongly lean towards factual but
Dr Who is relatively unpopular; Dr Who performs especially well in the Nordic countries. We will
take this point into account when developing any permanent international online offers. We see the
same from BBC Worldwide channels, programme and format sales and our international website
BBC.com, where audiences often want country-specific programme pages.

Re-directing to the relevant county’s service is intended to guide audiences. Moreover, it is vital to
allow us to operate within a public vs commercial funding distinction: our UK website BBC.co.uk can
only be made visible to licence fee payers and carries no advertising.

BBC Worldwide is a global leader in programme and format exports with stretching commercial
targets so where there is a business opportunity to exploit through a multi-territory or pan-EU
service, we will find it.

Other clear examples are the pan-EU satellite channels that launched in the 1990s and were
subsequently converted into country-specific portfolios (Eurosport, MTV), and ex-EU over-the-top
(OTT) services that choose to launch on a country-by-country basis in the EU, even where they have
significant negotiating power and a scale business (e.g. from Apple, Google, Amazon). We would also
note the national footprint of advertising markets, most broadcasting and telecom infrastructure, and
PSB funding and subsidies for EU works.

This issue is related to the subsequent questions on the ‘making available’ right. Under a strict
interpretation where ‘mere accessibility’ triggered rights clearance in a particular Member State, we
would incur rights and distribution costs for a series of countries where we did not intend to market
a service because the necessary consumer demand and related business case were not there. In
other words, in practice this requires broadcasters to acquire multi-territory or pan-EU licences.
There is a risk of the direction of CJEU Case C-170/12 ‘Pinckney’ creating a lack of clarity and
significant potential resource burden along these lines. To avoid the situation where a UK consumer
is entitled to seek access to a piece of content on an Italian service, but cannot then enjoy a version
adapted for the UK because the Italian provider now has exclusive pan-EU or multi-territory rights,
this scenario would also mean the end of exclusivity. It would likely mean both the highest and
lowest priced licences are lost in the EU, undermining the funding of production and distribution, and
the ability of smaller players to introduce national audiences to niche content (e.g. Channel 4 showed
Italian football in the UK).

                                                                                                        11
Two recent studies show that territorial licensing is still important to the continued success of the
audiovisual sector and the preservation of linguistic and cultural diversity, and that regulation
imposing cross-border or pan-EU services could mean audiences face higher prices and less choice10.

To conclude, we would like to address the related matter of portability, meaning temporary access
to a home online content service while travelling in another Member State. For subscription services,
industry has pledged the ‘further development of cross-border portability of subscription services’ as
part of the 2013 Licences for Europe dialogue, which we support11. The scenario where all rights had
to be cleared in each country where a service was merely accessible would affect the feasibility of
making the exact home service available, as compared to the traveller being able to access the
service and content cleared for the Member State travelled to.

For the public service BBC iPlayer (not a subscription service), we already allow licence fee payers to
download programmes before travelling, to take away with them. In this case, the relevant copyright
act takes place in the UK. As regards the possibility of licence fee payers accessing new programmes
once already travelling, we are keeping this under review as there are currently cost and technical
barriers, in addition to the rights question above. In particular, we would need to develop a technical
means of identifying UK licence fee payers logging-on in another Member State.

Streamlining the process of acquiring licences is a separate issue. The BBC is supportive of industry-
led initiatives such as the Copyright Hub (we are a member) and the Linked Content Coalition, and
improvements to collecting society governance through the Collective Rights Management Directive.



7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
   market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border
   availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate
   level of protection for right holders?

YES

We have answered ‘yes’ because we have suggestions of practical, non-legislative measures, as
outlined in response to question 2.



The act of ‘making available’

8. Is the scope of the ‘making available’ right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
   content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

YES

We have answered ‘yes’ because we do not have any evidence that the scope of the making available
right has caused problems for the licensing of audiovisual content. We believe that any definition of
scope is best left to the courts, so that the provision remains sufficiently flexible to apply to new
forms of technology.

We would like to make two points about the question of where the relevant act of making available
takes place.

In general, it is important for providers to be clear which intellectual property right they are using,
which rights are required to be licensed, and how any exemptions would be applied to the use, i.e.
what law will be applied. Should the EU legislative framework be opened for review, the idea that the
applicable law for rights clearance for the online platform is that of the ‘country of origin’, including for
services offered in multiple Member States, merits further analysis. In theory, this has the potential to
simplify the administrative process of rights clearance for broadcasters, releasing resources for
investment in new content and services – as the Satellite and Cable Directive has done. Under this
model, where a service was offered in multiple territories or pan-EU, clearance would be neutral
between those territories, as well as technology- and platform-neutral (i.e. as opposed to splintering
UK and ex-UK discussions).

To be clear, audience needs would still determine in which Member States a service was offered,
reflected in the territorial scope of licensing and other contractual agreements. We would expect the
current flexibility to remain.

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) response discusses the ‘country of origin’ issue further with
regard to rights clearance12. The costs and benefits for all stakeholders would need to be tested.

Secondly, in the event that the ‘country of origin’ concept is examined further, it would be
appropriate to look at the question of enforcement, meaning where an infringement takes place, what
law applies and where jurisdiction lies. We would like to contribute the following observations for
now.

Case C/170-12 ‘Pinckney’ (decided after the Commission’s legal study on making available was
written), interprets Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2201 of 22 December 2000 on
jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters, in
relation to the online sale of audiovisual material on DVD. It states that Art 5(3) lays down as the
sole condition the place where a harmful event occurred or may occur, which encompasses the place
where the damage occurred.

We would suggest that jurisdiction in relation to transmission in digital networks should not be
considered in isolation from the possible implications of Pinckney as there may be identical material
delivered by different methods.

If the ‘country of origin’ principle were applied, the applicable law and jurisdiction would be that of
the territory where the act of making available took place. That implies the place of the start of the
communication to the public (e.g. when the content is uploaded onto a website or is communicated
to an individual in another Member State via a stream), irrespective of whether any members of the
public could or did access the content in the country of origin, or whether the undertaking is located
in that territory.

If ‘country of origin’ were not applied, at the least targeting would need to be relevant, in the sense
of considering where the service intended to communicate or do business (other factors might also
need to be considered as meaningful even if the size of the relevant public was small). Defining
targeting is complex, which would need to be weighed against the risk and uncertainty of having to
conduct legal proceedings in an unrelated territory or where there is no significant access or sales,

12   http://www3.ebu.ch/en/policies/initiatives/copyright

                                                                                                          13
with the additional costs involved and for potentially low damages. This could be a significant
deterrent to offering services.

Lastly, it is important to be able to enforce injunctions and judgements across Europe effectively. A
corollary to a ‘country of origin’ approach might be a single pan-European order for injunctive relief
against an infringement that has been proved and is taking place across various Member States (as
opposed to the circumstances in Pinckney based on some very limited harm in only one Member
State where the content was merely accessible). Again, the costs and benefits of this idea would need
to be thoroughly tested.



9. Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have
   an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be
   an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or
   not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
   availability of injunctive relief13)?

YES

Given the variances in national copyright regimes and contractual law, it seems likely that any
clarification of the territorial scope of the making available right could affect one or more of the
above issues. These would need to be tested carefully in a cost benefit analysis. See question 8 on
injunctive relief.



Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to
    a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
    create problems for you?

NO

We refer to the BSAC and EBU responses to this question.



Linking and browsing

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
    protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
    subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

YES, under specific circumstances

We refer to the BSAC response to this question.




13 Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of
his/her right.

                                                                                                                   14
12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction
    of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in
    the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific
    circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

YES, under specific circumstances

We refer to the BSAC response to this question.



Download to own digital content

14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences
    of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital
    content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.

[Open question]

We are responding in relation to digital content including TV, films, apps, games and eBooks, which
are offered by BBC Worldwide.

The BBC works to help audiences to access our content online whenever, wherever and however
they want. We strongly believe that legislative intervention on the resale of digital content would
have unintended consequences for the availability of content and services on a download-to-own
basis, reducing consumer choice in an area of emerging business models.

When considering this area, it is vital that the fundamental differences between physical and digital
copies are not underestimated. We would also ask policy makers to carefully look at the whole value
chain and the state of market development. Legislative intervention would push providers to favour
services that avoid ‘first sale’ such as cloud-based service delivery or DRM delivery, providing
streaming plus temporary downloads for when the user is away from Internet access.

Digital copies are perfect, meaning they enter into direct competition with the original but without
the (third party) resale platform returning any rewards for the original creation to the content
producer. When a physical copy is resold, it ceases to be in the possession of the seller. For digital
copies it would be in many cases impossible to verify deletion of the original file (or files under
application of a private copying exception). In addition, both of these issues mean that digital resale
could enable the ‘laundering’ of illegal copies, exacerbating the copyright infringement problem and
again returning rewards to third parties that are not the right holders (piracy websites). It would also
create a legal risk for third party resale platforms about whether they are facilitating a legal or an
illegal act.

Instead, licensing is the appropriate tool to enable the resale of digital copies. Given the state of
market development, this is a more proportionate, flexible and nimble solution. One option is for
rights holders to enter into volume licensing agreements with a third party resale platform enabling
resale, and possibly revenue share. Or resale may be enabled within the right holder’s device and
storage ecosystem, which enables the right holder to verify that the original was legal, and that the
seller has destroyed the originals upon sale.

In addition, it is important that end-users are able to easily understand the different functionality and
rights that come with physical and different types of digital files, to support informed purchasing
                                                                                                       15
decisions. The BBC has a copyright education initiative and is cooperating with other creative
industry stakeholders.

In particular, digital copies may have resale limitations, but they are also smaller/ lighter, can be easily
shifted between devices, and can be accessed immediately upon purchase. Indeed, to cater to the
different consumer needs met by each format, we see that businesses increasingly offer a bundle of a
physical and a digital copy (such as a DVD plus Ultraviolet for cloud-based streaming and downloads,
or music CD plus MP3 version from Amazon and Cloud Player).



Registration of works and other subject matter

15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification
    and licensing of works and other subject matter?

NO

17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

We refer to the BSAC response to this question.



The use and interoperability of identifiers

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in
the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
ownership and permissions databases?

We refer to the BSAC and EBU responses to this question.



Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
    provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

NO

We support the principle of harmonisation and in our experience the current framework strikes the
right balance. It has not caused BBC Worldwide – one of the most active exporters of programmes
and formats – significant challenges that would justify an argument for legislative change.

We would observe that the Commission’s legal study has not compared approaches across Member
States in all of the areas where exceptions are permitted. That seems necessary in order to inform
further debate about harmonisation, including whether exceptions should be mandatory.



22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need
    for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?


                                                                                                         16
NO

Please see our response to question 21.



23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases

NO

We do not have evidence that any change is required to the existing catalogue.



24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
    degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and
    exceptions?

NO

We do not have evidence that greater flexibility is required in the EU framework for limitations and
exceptions. It is worth noting that the UK Government has recently carried out a review of
exceptions in the UK, notably in light of the development of new digital technologies, content and
services, and has been able to propose updates to national law within the existing EU framework.
This includes exceptions for parody and quotation; private copying; education; research, libraries and
archives; and exceptions for people with disabilities.

Many of the suggested means of providing for flexibility under question 25 are already available:
interpretation by national courts and the CJEU, Commission reviews, and ‘fair dealing’ as in the UK.

Fair dealing is especially valuable to the BBC and other broadcasters for the purposes of criticism,
review and news reporting, as well as non-commercial research (Sections 29 and 30 Copyright,
Designs and Patents Act 198814).

We would be very concerned by any proposal to introduce ‘fair use’ in the EU. This is unnecessary in
light of the tools already available to Member States under the existing framework. And it would
create legal uncertainty and increased costs for broadcasters and for individuals as creators and as
end-users: many decades of case law has been necessary in the United States, and it still falls to
experts to advise on application. That cannot help consumer transparency or understanding of the
copyright regime, which are important to support cultural expression and economic growth in the
EU.



26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience,
constitute a problem

NO




14   http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/30

                                                                                                       17
We have answered ‘no’ because we do not have evidence that the territoriality of limitations and
exceptions under the EU legislative framework constitutes a particular problem in itself. Indeed, this
is one of the features of the current balance between harmonisation and flexibility, which allows
Member States to reflect particular circumstances within their national law.



Access to content in libraries and archives

28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation
exception

NO



Mass digitisation

41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’
archives)?

YES

We have answered ‘yes’ because at EU level, we supported dialogue as part of Licences for Europe15
to increase mutual understanding of the challenges around rights clearance for PSB archives between
different stakeholders in the audiovisual sector. Because the underlying rights in older archive works
were originally cleared before online distribution was envisaged, aside from rights payments, the
administrative costs of going back and individually clearing these can be unviable, especially for works
of possible ‘citizen’ relevance (e.g. films of a historical streetscape). As such, European PSBs would
welcome the fostering of collective and extended collective licensing (ECL) under national law, in
accordance with the current EU legislative framework.



Teaching

44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

The well-established Educational recording Agency (ERA) licensing scheme in the UK, in accordance
with section 35 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 198816, acts as a useful conduit for
educational establishments to be licensed to record programmes off-air from radio and television
broadcasts. It also delivers changes to licences to meet the demands of educational establishments as
they use white board technologies and provide online distance learning services for pupils and

teachers linked to a licensed educational establishment17.

In addition, the industry-led UK Copyright Hub is successfully carrying out work to streamline the
licensing process for educational material more generally, and to provide information to orientate
prospective copyright users18.



User-generated content

63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

The BBC has experience with user-generated content (UGC) both as a user, as we may use content
shared by audiences, as well as a right holder when others have re-used BBC productions for UGC.
In both cases, we strongly consider that the existing law is adequate – either a use is covered by an
exception or it is necessary to clear the rights. We would also note that where an exception applies,
remuneration might still be due.

In considering solutions, it is essential to take into account the whole value chain and not only rights
holders and end-users. Third party platforms often host UGC and benefit from its presence
financially – both directly (revenue-share) and indirectly (surrounding advertising).

Where rights clearance is required, licensing solutions are the proportionate answer. Moreover,
volume licensing agreements are already emerging between rights holders and the hosting platform,
such as in the music sector, which is a neat and simple solution for end-users.

Lastly, we would highlight the importance of copyright education for end-users and individual
creators to help them to understand and navigate the copyright regime (which will also reward their
own creative work). The BBC has a copyright education initiative.

On a related point, we would note that overseeing the notice and take-down regime is onerous due
to the different approaches and levels of responsiveness of hosting platforms19.



Private copying and reprography

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application
of the private copying and reprography exceptions20 in the digital environment?

YES

Our specific concern is that national implementation does not allow the private copying exception to
be exploited by third party platforms, usually for commercial ends, to avoid seeking authorization and
a voluntary licensing solution with rights holders. To be clear, this problem can be addressed at
Member State level under the existing EU copyright framework. However, we have answered ‘yes’

content hosted by online intermediaries’ http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2012/clean-and-open-

20 Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.


                                                                                                                           19
because it may be that EU-level guidance would prove helpful, such as an Interpretive
Communication.

Increasingly, telecom, IPTV and Internet operators offer a service against payment that records and
allows on-demand access to TV content. Given increasing storage capacity, such services can
determine to record whole channels or genres based on data about the consumer, and store these
for an unlimited period. It therefore becomes a parallel on-demand service, but without a licensing
agreement with the broadcaster, and even including content that underlying rights holders have
preferred not to licence for inclusion in broadcaster on-demand services.

However, an implementation of the exception at national level that acts to prevent a voluntary
licensing solution from emerging between right holders and third party platforms seriously
undermines the continued investment in original broadcast productions, to the future detriment of
audiences. This seems counter to Recital 44 of the Information Society Directive21. Such practices
are markedly different from the traditional use made by consumers of a private copying or a time-
shifting exception, which allow an individual end-user to choose to record content to watch at a more
convenient time or on a more convenient device, for their own private use and for ends that are
neither directly nor indirectly commercial, and which the BBC supports.



Respect for rights

75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose

YES

We refer to the EBU response to this question in addition to the EBU submission to the EU
consultation on civil enforcement of IPR (March 2013)22 and the BBC and EBU responses to the EU
consultation on procedures for notifying and acting on illegal content hosted by online intermediaries
(September 2012). 23 See also our response to question 8 on jurisdiction.



A single EU Copyright Title

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across
the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

NO

We refer to the EBU response to this question and the BSAC response to the related question 79.


21 In particular: (44) .... Such exceptions and limitations may not be applied in a way which prejudices the legitimate interests
of the rightholder or which conflicts with the normal exploitation of his work or other subject-matter. The provision of
such exceptions or limitations by Member States should, in particular, duly reflect the increased economic impact that such
exceptions or limitations may have in the context of the new electronic environment. Therefore, the scope of certain exceptions or
limitations may have to be even more limited when it comes to certain new uses of copyright works and other subject-matter.
