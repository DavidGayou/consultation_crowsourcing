   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


x YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)


UK residents have found themselves in the  position  where,  despite  paying
the BBC licence fee, they are unable to access BBC’s  iPlayer  when  abroad.
As explained on the BBC’s own website,  “Rights  agreements  mean  that  BBC
iPlayer Television programmes are  only  available  to  users  in  the  UK”:
http://iplayerhelp.external.bbc.co.uk/help/outside_the_uk/


In ARTICLE 19’s view, this is  plainly  unacceptable,  especially  when  the
licence fee  has  already  been  paid.  Moreover,  there  is  no  reason  in
principle why audio-visual content, for instance, should not  be  accessible
across borders when cross-portability of content does not appear  to  be  an
issue for other types of digital content, such as online newspapers.

   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,

      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.

   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]


ARTICLE 19 believes that content should be equally  accessible  in  all  MS,
irrespective of nationality or place of residence.  Failure  to  ensure  the
right  to  receive  and  impart  information  across  borders   through   an
appropriate legal framework is arguably a breach of Member States’  positive
obligations under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  In
our view, copyright harmonization  through  legal  reform  is  essential  to
guarantee equal access to online content and services in  all  EU  countries
(see below).





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?

      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?

   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


x YES – Please explain


Market-led solutions are plainly insufficient to address the current gap  in
access to cultural goods. This is  especially  obvious  in  the  context  of
“illegal” file-sharing. We note, for instance, the  experiment  carried  out
by a French blogger and consumer Klaire. After testing 20  “legal”  websites
recommended by HADOPI to obtain cultural  goods,  she  concluded  that  only
three of  them  functioned  properly:  http://www.klaire.fr/2013/06/10/ivre-
hadopi-adopte-le-label-pur-foutage-de-gueule/.    Her    blog    post    was
subsequently cited in a news article in the Nouvel Observateur:

ARTICLE 19 believes  that  copyright  harmonization  through  EU-wide  legal
reform is needed to ensure online services are equally available in  all  EU
countries.


€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION


Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ YES

x NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

“Making available” is commonly understood as “posting” or “sharing”  content
online. Unless the meaning of the “communication to the public”  or  “making
available” right is more clearly  defined,  the  default  position  is  more
likely to be that the scope of the right to make content available  will  be
interpreted broadly at the expense of freedom  of  expression,  particularly
in the context of hyperlinking (see  further  below).  ARTICLE  19  urges  a
narrower definition of the concept of ‘making  content  available’  to  only
those well-established instances of commercial  exploitation  in  which  the
concept has been clearly defined.


€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


€ NO


x NO OPINION


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


x NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)


ARTICLE 19 believes that hyperlinks should not be subject  to  authorisation
of the copyright holder in general. As the  consultation  itself  recognises
hyperlinks “are indispensable for the  functioning  of  the  Internet  as  a
network”. It is no exaggeration to say that the Internet itself is a  series
of hyperlinks. The use of links is also a basic feature of  everyday  online
interaction. It is essential for work, study, personal enjoyment  and  other
forms of recreation. As such, it is part and parcel of the right to  receive
and impart information under Article 10 of the European Convention on  Human
Rights (right to freedom  of  expression).  Therefore,  any  restriction  on
linking should strictly comply with requirements of legality, necessity  and
proportionality under Article 10 ECHR.


For all intents and purposes, the  right  of  communication  to  the  public
under Article 3 of the 2001/29 EC Directive could provide  the  legal  basis
for the restriction on the right to freedom of expression. If, however,  the
right of communication to the public of ‘works’ were to include  linking  to
both authorized  and  unauthorized  copies,  this  would  amount  to  rights
holders having the right to control linking to their own work. In  practice,
the vast majority – if not all –  hyperlinks  would  need  to  be  expressly
licensed. This would be both absurd and plainly disproportionate.


ARTICLE 19 believes that once a work is published online, anyone  should  be
free to link to it, regardless of whether or not the material linked  to  is
an infringing copy. We agree with the European Copyright  Society’s  Opinion
in  the  Svensson  case  (C-466/12)  that  hyperlinking  does  not   involve
“transmission” of a work and should not be considered as  “communication  to
the public”. The High Court of England and Wales recently came to a  similar
conclusion in  Paramount  Home  Entertainment  International  and  Others  v
British Sky Broadcasting Ltd and others ([2013]EWHC  3479  (Ch)).  Arnold  J
acknowledged that “it is arguable that the mere provision of a hyperlink  is
not enough to constitute communication to the public  (particularly  if  the
hyperlink is not directly to  a  source  of  the  copyright  work).  I  also
acknowledge that it is arguable that it makes no difference whether  or  not
the source of the copyright work to which the hyperlink  links  is  licensed
by the copyright owner. I also acknowledge  that  it  is  arguable  that  it
makes no difference whether clicking on the links results in  framing  (i.e.
the work being presented within the frame  of  the  operator's  website)  or
not”.


Conversely, we consider  that  the  CJEU’s  approach  in  Svensson  is  both
impractical and likely to have a chilling effect on freedom  of  expression.
While the Court  confirmed  that  linking  to  copyright  work  made  freely
available on the Internet with the authority of the  copyright  holder  does
not infringe, it failed to provide clear rules to Internet  users  in  other
circumstances, for instance where copyright work is freely available on  the
internet but was never authorized by the copyright holder at any  point.  In
other words, the Court’s judgment has left  Internet  users  in  a  position
where it would be extremely difficult for them to know  in  advance  whether
or not they are infringing copyright when they are linking  to  material  on
the Internet. This is all  the  more  so  given  the  inherent  cross-border
nature of linking and the lack of harmonized exception in  the  EU.  Several
commentators have already pointed out the shortcomings of the  decision  and
argued that the Court should have held that providing a link is not an  “act
of communication”.


Like the European Copyright Society, ARTICLE 19  considers  that  hyperlinks
are better viewed as a location tool  or  footnotes,  i.e.  references  that
Internet users are free to follow or not; they should not be  considered  as
“communication to the public”.  To  hold  otherwise  would  have  a  serious
chilling on freedom of expression. At the same time, we recognize that  this
should not prevent a  finding  of  contributory  liability  for  linking  in
limited circumstances, for instance when knowingly facilitating  the  making
available of infringing copies.

  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


x NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)


The ordinary use of the Internet,  including  browsing  and  viewing  a  web
page, involves the creation  of  temporary  and  cached  copies  at  several
stages.  Accordingly,  subjecting  such  copies  to  the  authorisation   of
copyright holders in general would seriously limit the  effective  operation
of the Internet as well as severely restricting  the  ability  of  users  to
access information. In ARTICLE 19’s  view,  this  would  also  constitute  a
breach of the right to freedom of expression,  which  implies  the  personal
right to read, listen to, view and browse cultural goods  without  copyright
restrictions,  including  online  (Principle  7.1  of  the  Right  to  Share
Principles).


ARTICLE 19 further believes that the UK Supreme Court  adopted  the  correct
approach to temporary copies in the Meltwater case  (currently  referred  to
the CJEU). The Supreme Court concluded that EU law (in particular Article  5
(1) of the 2001/29/EC  Directive)  allows  an  exception  to  copyright  for
temporary copies generated by Internet users as  a  necessary  part  of  the
technical process supporting the  browsing  experience.  The  Supreme  Court
said that to hold otherwise would  lead  to  the  unacceptable  result  that
millions of ordinary Internet users  across  the  EU  would  be  liable  for
copyright infringement for merely browsing web  pages  containing  copyright
material. The Supreme Court found that there was no  sound  reason  why  the
unauthorised viewing or reading (as opposed to downloading or  printing)  of
copyrighted  material  online  should   be   considered   an   infringement,
especially since this had never been the case in the offline world. 


This approach is further supported by the fact that of  all  the  exceptions
and limitations to copyright provided for under  the  2001/29/EC  Directive,
Article 5 (1)  (temporary  acts  of  reproduction)  is  the  only  mandatory
exception.


In ARTICLE 19’s opinion, temporary and cached copies should remain  a  clear
exception to copyright protection. To hold otherwise would both defy  common
sense and be a clear breach of the right to read and browse online.

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


x NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter


ARTICLE 19 believes  that  copyright  duration  should  be  no  longer  than
necessary to achieve its purpose without impairing the right to  freedom  of
expression (Principle 5.1 of ARTICLE 19’s Right to  Share  Principles).  The
steady increase of copyright terms is a major issue for  access  to  culture
as it effectively means that fewer and fewer works enter the public  domain,
hampering amateur creativity online. In  our  view,  the  current  copyright
duration  of  70  years  after  the  death  of  the  author  constitutes  an
unjustified restriction on  the  right  to  freedom  of  expression  and  an
encroachment on the public domain (Principle 5.2.  of  the  Right  to  Share
Principles).


There is also ample evidence to suggest that the economic  value  attributed
to long or longer copyright terms is grossly exaggerated. For instance,  the
UK’s 2011 Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property  and  Growth  concluded
that “Economic evidence is clear that the  likely  deadweight  loss  to  the
economy exceeds any additional incentivising effect which might result  from
the  extension  of  copyright  term  beyond   its   current   levels...   An
international study found term extension to have no impact on output”  (page
19). Similarly,  using  empirical  parameters,  Cambridge  economist,  Rufus
Pollock, estimated  15  years  as  the  optimal  copyright  protection  term
extending up to 38 years. In 2003, the Economist suggested  to  go  back  to
the initial 14-year copyright term of  18th  century  British  and  American
copyright laws. For these reasons, we would support policies  that  seek  to
reduce copyright terms.


Furthermore, the copyright term laid down  by  the  EU  rules  should  be  a
maximum that no  country  should  be  allowed  to  override,  for  instance,
through war-time exceptions, such as in France (see article L123-10  of  the
code la propriété intellectuelle). Allowing countries  to  extend  copyright
terms in this way creates legal uncertainty  as  the  same  content  may  be
copyrighted in one country but not another.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

x YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


The obvious downside  to  making  limitations  and  exception  to  copyright
optional is the  lack  of  legal  certainty  for  both  Internet  users  and
businesses. Something that is legal in a member state may  well  be  illegal
in another. For instance, parody is  a  recognised  exception  to  copyright
under French law but not English law. By the  same  token,  the  absence  of
some copyright exceptions in some countries but not others  is  more  likely
to promote forum shopping, where  powerful  companies  or  artists  seek  to
bring claims in countries where they are more likely to succeed.


Since limitations and exceptions are the internal mechanism whereby  freedom
of expression is protected under  copyright  law,  the  lack  of  harmonised
exceptions can also be viewed as failure to provide for equal protection  of
freedom of expression across the EU. In other words, freedom  of  expression
is protected to different degrees in different states.


Copyright  limits  freedom  of  expression.  Whilst  such  limits   may   be
justified, the exceptions and limitations should be interpreted  broadly  so
as to give greater protection to freedom of  expression  (Principle  6.1  of
the Right to  Share  Principles).   In  order  to  ensure  that  freedom  of
expression is sufficiently protected, all limitations and exceptions  should
be mandatory.  This would also provide greater legal  certainty  and  foster
innovation across the EU.


€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION


  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

x YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


We find that there is no reason in principle why some exceptions  should  be
made mandatory whilst others should remain optional.  Moreover,  this  would
defeat the purpose  of  bringing  greater  legal  certainty  in  this  area.
Accordingly, we believe all exceptions should be made mandatory.


€ NO – Please explain.


€ NO OPINION



  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]


No limitations or exceptions should be removed from the existing  catalogue.
On the contrary, it should be made clear that the catalogue contains a  non-
exhaustive list of limitations and exceptions. This  would  provide  greater
flexibility by allowing new exceptions and limitations  to  be  added  where
appropriate. For instance, it would be desirable  to  add  an  exception  to
copyright as regards user-generated content and the right to rip,  mash  and
burn.


  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

x YES – Please explain why


It should be self-evident from reading Article 5 of the  2001/29/EC  that  a
catalogue containing an exhaustive list of  exceptions  and  limitations  to
copyright is not a flexible instrument  to  tackle  the  challenges  of  the
digital environment. Article 5 contains 5 sub-paragraphs. Article 5  (2)  in
particular is subdivided into 15 clauses detailing  specific  exceptions  to
copyright in addition to those contained under Article 5 (1) and 5 (2).


The fact that some exceptions are optional does not render EU copyright  law
more flexible in the EU. It  only  gives  more  flexibility  to  the  Member
States in terms of implementation of the Directive and taking  into  account
their  countries’  peculiarities.   However,   the   same   flexibility   of
implementation could be achieved with a simple mandatory fair-use  provision
that would also provide greater flexibility in terms of copyright law.


Copyright  law  needs  to  adapt  to  the  digital  environment.   Regularly
revisiting the Directive and updating an endless list  of  exceptions  would
not be a practical way of tackling the problem.


€ NO – Please explain why


€ NO OPINION


  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]


In ARTICLE 19’s view, the best approach to provide for flexibility would  be
the  adoption  of  a  new  fair-use  or  fair  dealing  provision  (built-in
flexibility). This would also give greater leeway  to  national  courts  and
the CJEU to interpret exceptions to copyright flexibly to take into  account
changing circumstances, for instance new developments brought about  by  new
technologies. This model has worked well  in  the  US,  where  there  is  no
suggestion that copyright is not strongly protected.  It  would  also  avoid
the necessity of periodically reviewing the relevant Directives, which is  a
time-consuming  and  resource-intensive  exercise.  Interpretations  of  the
Commission seem undesirable, as it  is  an  executive  –type  of  body.  The
Directive  (or Regulation)  themselves  should  already  contain  sufficient
general principles of interpretation in the Recitals.

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[41] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[42].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[43].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with

[Open question]


  33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

ARTICLE 19  believes  that  copyright  exceptions  should  allow  libraries,
broadcasters, museums and other cultural spaces to  make  available  online,
free-of-charge or  at  low  cost,  the  widest  possible  range  of  content
(Principle  13.4  of  the  Right  to  Share  Principles).   In   particular,
substantially publicly funded works should be recognised as  a  public  good
and made widely available to the public, including online  (Principle  13.5,
op.cit.).

To the extent that Article 5 (3) (n) of the Directive already  provides  for
an exception covering research or private study in  dedicated  terminals  at
libraries, educational establishments, museums or archives, it  is  hard  to
understand on what basis remote access to library collections should not  be
covered under that exception. In practice, this has the effect  of  imposing
a restriction on access to information  online  where  no  such  restriction
exists offline. This is  surprising,  given  that  any  concern  related  to
‘piracy’ could easily be overcome  by  the  provision  of  temporary  access
codes to libraries’ registered users (something which is touched on as  part
of sub-section 3 below on e-lending).

Consistent with our recommendation under Q21 and 22, we believe  that  at  a
minimum, the exception under Article 5  (3)  (n)  should  be  mandatory  and
interpreted broadly along the lines outlined above so as to give  meaningful
effect to the right to freedom of expression.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[44].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[45].

      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective

      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to

commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [49].

The Marrakesh Treaty[50] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across

  51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

[Open question]

ARTICLE 19 submits that States must ensure  that  people  with  disabilities
have equal access to  knowledge  (principle  13.6  of  the  Right  to  Share
Principles). In line with our overall recommendation under Q21  and  22,  we
believe that, at a minimum, the exception for the benefit of people  with  a
disability under  Article  5  (3)  (b)  of  the  Directive  should  be  made
mandatory. In our  view,  Member  States’  failure  to  implement  copyright
exceptions benefiting people with sensory impairments is  likely  to  breach
their right to freedom of  expression,  private  life  and  their  right  to
participate in cultural life (see principle 13.6 cited above).


We further believe that the current lack of legal cross border  exchange  of
accessible format copies could partly be overcome by swift ratification  and
implementation  of  the  Marrakesh  treaty.  This  would  be   achieved   by
introducing a mandatory exception to copyright  which  allows  organisations
for the blind to produce, distribute and make  available  accessible  format
copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the  rights
holders. At the same time, such  an  exception  should  not  necessarily  be
confined  to  blind  or  visually  impaired  persons  but   should   include
individuals with other sensory impairments.

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[51] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[52].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[53]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[54].


  58. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you

      subject matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
      across borders?

problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?


x YES – Please explain by giving examples


ARTICLE 19 has not  experienced  any  particular  problems  in  relation  to
content we upload on our website. However, we frequently refrain from  using
certain types of content, such as images or music to illustrate our  written
material in order to avoid any potential copyright issues.  Put  it  simply,
an NGO such as ours could not face the prospect  of  court  action  or  even
lengthy discussions about the question whether or not  we  may  or  may  not
have infringed copyright  and  the  potential  consequences.  In  short,  we
censor ourselves. In our view, the lack of strong  fair  use  protection  in
the EU of the kind found in the US, including the  absence  of  a  right  to
remix (or mix, mash and burn), effectively has a  powerful  chilling  effect
on free expression and creativity.


Furthermore, unless users come  forward  about  any  potential  difficulties
they may have had regarding transformative uses of  existing  works  online,
very few such cases are known to the  public  and  consistently  documented.
Most cases never go to court. Rather, the vast majority of them  are  likely
to be dealt with, i.e. taken down, under  the  Terms  and  Conditions  of  a
platform such as YouTube. In other words, vast  swathes  of  creativity  can
vanish without a trace in the absence of proper scrutiny.


Finally, we would like to draw the Commission’s attention to a  recent  2013
report commissioned by Ofcom on User-Generated content,  in  which  UGC  was
identified as a  key  driver  for  innovation  and  creativity  in  the  UK.
Conversely,  the  report  noted  that  restrictive   intellectual   property
practices hindered creative engagement. In particular, the report  concluded
that “it would be both a shame and deeply ironic if  copyright  law,  itself
devised to drive innovation, were to end  up  limiting  through  overzealous
application.”   http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/research-

  61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


[Open question]


In ARTICLE 19’s view, the cultural value of UGC must be  both  promoted  and
protected. In this regard,  the  current  EU  copyright  framework  is  both
overly rigid and out-dated.  Its  system  of  copyright  exceptions  is  too
narrowly drafted to cover  UGC.  It  thus  fails  to  provide  the  kind  of
protection and legal certainty that users need to protect  their  rights  in
this area. An additional  exception  to  copyright  would  be  a  much  more
powerful means to do just that than a micro-licensing agreement where  users
are almost inevitably in a weaker position than copyright holders.


For this  reason,  we  believe  that  new  copyright  exceptions  should  be
created, including a new copyright exception to  remix  and/or  strong  fair
use copyright exception similar to the one found in the  US  (Principle  6.2
of the Right to Share Principles). If only the fair use  exception  were  to
be adopted and made into law, it should  be  both  drafted  and  interpreted
broadly so as to cover creative and  transformative  uses  of  the  original
work.





  62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?

[Open question]

See Q 62 above. In our  view,  any  legislative  solution  should  have  two
components:


(i) a copyright exception to remix (or mix, mash and burn); and /or


(ii) a generous fair use  exception  as  part  of  a  new  broader  in-built
flexibility in the EU copyright system (see Q21-26 above).


We further believe that any copyright  exception  to  remix  should  not  be
confined to non-commercial activities. As bestseller  author,  Naomi  Novik,
recently said in her testimony to the US Congress,  “We  all  build  on  the
work and ideas of people who came before us — in fact that’s  the  only  way
to innovate. There isn’t a hard  line  between  remix  work  and  work  that
stands on its own. They exist on a continuum.”


She went on to explain “Original work, work that stands alone, doesn’t  just
pop up out  of  nowhere.  It  is  at  the  end  of  a  natural  spectrum  of
transformation. Fair use protects  this  spectrum,  this  incubator  if  you
will. It’s a space where  artists  can  play  with  ideas  and  develop  our
skills, and share our work within a community and learn. I cannot  overstate
the importance this space has been in the development of my own career,  and
that of many other professional writers and creators that I know.”


In other words, whether it takes the form of a copyright exception to  remix
or fair use, the fact that the transformative work is subsequently used  for
a commercial purpose should not mean that it automatically  becomes  subject
to copyright authorisation.


For the importance of  transformative  uses  of  original  work,  see  Naomi
Novik’s testimony here:

  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[55]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[56][57].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[58]  in
      the digital environment?

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[61].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[62] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[63]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[64] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[65].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[66]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[67].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

€ YES – Please explain


€ NO – Please explain


ARTICLE 19  notes  at  the  outset  that  the  concept  of  infringement  of
copyright for a “commercial” purpose  should  be  clarified.  We  note,  for
instance, that three-strikes and Internet  disconnection  –  an  enforcement
measure which currently  does  not  feature  in  IPR  Enforcement  Directive
(Directive 2004/48/EC)- was ordered against an individuals  user  under  the
French HADOPI law in circumstances which hardly qualify as  infringement  on
a “commercial scale” (2 songs). The measure was eventually not applied.


In any event, ARTICLE 19 strongly opposes any additional  enforcement  tools
such as Internet disconnection  and  other  three-strikes-type  of  measures
that have a chilling effect on the right to freedom of  expression.  The  UN
Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression has confirmed that this  amounts
to a disproportionate restriction on the right to freedom of  expression  in
his report of 16 May 2011 (A/HRC/17/27 at paras. 78 and  79).  Moreover,  as
the French experience demonstrates,  such  measures  are  ineffective  as  a
matter of practice: the HADOPI scheme has been widely viewed  as  a  failure
and a vast waste of resources, which ultimately led to  the  repeal  of  the
Internet disconnection provision in the HADOPI law.


Finally, we note that in both the Scarlet Extended SA v SABAM  (C70-10)  and
SABAM v Netlog  (C360-10)  cases,  the  CJEU  emphasised  that  intellectual
property rights as enshrined in the EU Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights  are
far from absolute and that there was nothing whatsoever in  the  Charter  or
the Court’s jurisprudence to suggest that such rights must be  protected  at
all costs (para. 43, our emphasis). In particular, the Court  said  that  EU
law did not allow states to require Internet service  providers  to  install
filtering systems to prevent the illegal downloading of  files.   The  Court
considered that such a filtering system would effectively  require  ISPs  to
monitor  the  information  that  it  transmits  on  its  network,  which  is
prohibited under EU law.


In ARTICLE 19’s  opinion,  the  European  Commission  should  not  focus  on
enforcement of rigid, one-sided and out-dated  copyright  laws.  Rather,  it
should concentrate its efforts on adapting those laws to make  them  fairer,
more balanced and ultimately  fit  for  the  digital  age  along  the  lines
outlined in our answers above.


€ NO OPINION


  76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear  enough  to  allow
      for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service
      providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name
      registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with  a
      commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be  useful  to  foster
      the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]

ARTICLE 19 is concerned by the way in which  this  question  is  framed.  It
suggests the European Commission’s willingness to act as broker with a  view
to ensuring copyright enforcement by contract. In our  view,  this  is  both
unnecessary and likely to be in breach of Article 52 of the  EU  Charter  on
Fundamental Rights, which  requires  that  any  limitations  on  the  rights
contained the Charter must be provided by law.


- In our view, intermediaries are already sufficiently involved through  the
use  of  notice-and-takedown  procedures  as  a  result  of  the  E-Commerce
Directive (ECD). Moreover, the IPR Enforcement Directive provides the  basis
for copyright holders to apply for website blocking injunctions. As we  have
noted on several occasions, these measures are  already  deeply  problematic
for freedom of expression.


- The Commission seems to be suggesting  that  intermediaries  should  adopt
voluntary measures beyond their legal obligations and incentives already  in
place under the ECD. This kind of “cooperation” was  at  the  heart  of  the
enforcement scheme under the  Anti-Counterfeiting  Trade  Agreement  (ACTA),
which was rejected by the European Parliament.  In  practice,  “cooperation”
usually  involves  three-strikes  type  of  measures  which  may  result  in
takedown, blocking or throttling depending on the service provider at  issue
(e.g. YouTube’s Terms of Service and Copyright Policy and  in  the  US,  the
memoranda of understanding between  Comcast,  AT&T  and  Time  Warner  Cable
among others).  In  order  for  these  measures  to  be  effective,  service
providers usually rely, among other things, on monitoring  technology  (e.g.
Content ID on YouTube) or software that enables  them  to  analyse  peer-to-
peer networks and harvest vast swathes of  IP  addresses  (see  EDRi  paper,
Human Rights and Privatised Law Enforcement, February 2014, page 11).  Other
measures  include  blocking  payments  to  websites  deemed  “illegal”   and
arbitrary domain name removals (Ibid.).


One of the reasons these types of measures are promoted is the  belief  that
human rights  obligations  do  not  apply  to  contractual  obligations  and
therefore may not be scrutinised for their  proportionality  by  the  courts
despite the fact that they are deeply inimical to free speech  and  threaten
the right to privacy. In our view, however,  voluntary  measures  that  have
the effect of a restriction on  fundamental  rights  would  be  incompatible
with Article 52 of  the  EU  Charter.  Moreover,  it  is  questionable  that
measures such as giving preference to certain  “legal”  websites  in  search
rankings (see, for instance, Lescure report in France,  page  43)  would  be
compatible with EU competition law.


ARTICLE 19 reiterates that Internet intermediaries should not be liable  for
infringing content disseminated by third  parties  (Principle  10.2  of  the
Right to Share Principles) and should  not  be  required  to  monitor  their
services to prevent copyright infringement (Principle 10.3 of the  Right  to
Share  Principles).  Strong  protection  of  Internet  intermediaries   from
liability is the corner stone of innovation and freedom  of  expression  and
communication online. In the EU,  this  is  achieved  by  the  safe  harbour
regime under Article 12-15 of the  E-Commerce  Directive.  This  fundamental
principle should not be eroded by privatising online  copyright  enforcement
through the  use  of  self-regulatory  measures  that  threaten  fundamental
rights,  sidestep  democratic  processes  and   operate   outside   judicial
scrutiny.


ARTICLE 19 believes that intermediaries should only be required to block  or
remove infringing content if the measure requiring it  is  provided  by  law
and ordered by a court, tribunal or other independent adjudicatory  body  in
accordance with the rule of law  (Principle  10.4  of  the  Right  to  Share
Principles). Notice-and-notice systems should be  encouraged  to  deal  with
copyright claims rather than  notice-and-takedown  procedures  that  have  a
chilling effect on freedom of expression (Ibid,  Principle  10.5).  Equally,
if  copyright  infringement  is  established,  a  court   may   order   that
advertising or payment services be withdrawn after balancing  the  competing
interests at stake, including the right to freedom of expression.



  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

€ YES – Please explain


x NO – Please explain


In ARTICLE 19’s view, the  current  civil  enforcement  framework  fails  to
properly balance the protection of copyright and the  right  to  freedom  of
expression. While both rights are equally protected under  the  EU  Charter,
the interpretation of instruments aimed at protecting intellectual  property
almost inevitably results in  the  right  to  freedom  of  expression  being
ignored. For instance, the CJEU did not consider the impact  of  its  ruling
for the right to freedom of expression in  the  Svensson  despite  the  fact
that linking is central to the exercise of  freedom  of  expression  on  the
Internet. Similarly, while Arnold J considered free expression arguments  in
the Newzbin 2 case [2011] EWHC 1981 (Ch),  which  concerned  an  application
for a website blocking injunction, he dismissed those arguments  as  clearly
outweighed by the interests of rights holders (see para.  200).  ARTICLE  19
believes that the European Commission should do more to educate the  various
actors involved, including relevant public authorities  and  the  judiciary,
on  the  implications  of  copyright  protection  for  fundamental   rights,
especially the right to freedom of expression.


We further believe that the right to privacy of individual users  should  be
reinforced in relation to copyright claims.  In  particular,  we  note  that
despite protection of the right to privacy and personal data  under  EU  law
(see  also  CJEU  -  Bonnier  Audio  C461-10),  Internet  users’  subscriber
information has been abused by “copyright trolls” in countries such  as  the
UK (See ACS: Law case). In our view, this should be remedied, for  instance,
by penalising abusive copyright claims.

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


€ NO


x NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[23] The objective of implementing a “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to

Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable

[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
