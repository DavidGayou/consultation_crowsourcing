        I.     Introduction
A.           Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
                                                                           




parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
                                                                




whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which
rapid progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
                                                                     




practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:

1!   COM (2012)789 final, 18/12/2012.
2!As announced in the Intellectual Property Strategy ' A single market for Intellectual Property Rights: COM

(2012)789.

"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
                   




establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
                                                                           




distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
                                                                               




valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

        II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.          Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
            anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.                    




The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
                                               




territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
                                                                       




“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
                                




Linked Content Coalition13.         




"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.                 




Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that

   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical

are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15             




to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

B.       Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
         authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
                                                                          




aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
                               




Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which              




are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
                                                    




e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital

upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
                                         




(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.      Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
        content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
 YES
  NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)

9.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
        of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
        whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to
        have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement
        of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief24)?      




 YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
! The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different persons/
entities.

10.       [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
          rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
          download) create problems for you?
 YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
                                




a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
                                                                                   




copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.
!
11.       Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
          protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
          subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
No. In no circumstance should hyperlinks be subject to protection under copyright.
Sharing links without needing permission from the rightsholder is core to the operation
of the internet. Changing this fundamental structural aspect of how the internet works
would be detrimental to the free flow of information and commerce online.
The creator of a hyperlink must be free to link to publicly available resources without
having to worry about infringing copyright. This needs to be the case regardless of the
legal status of the linked work or of the intent of the rightholder who has published such
a work (or authorized the publication). The recent ruling of the CJEU on the the
Svensson case has unfortunately not provided the required amount of clarity and as a
result the European legislator needs to enact unambiguous rules that ensure that the act
of hyperlinking falls outside the scope of actions protected by copyright. Failing to do so
will risk placing European internet users, businesses and innovators at a competitive
disadvantage vis a vis the rest of the world. It would also be a clear signal that the
European legislator does not understand the important role that open networks play in
fields like innovation, access to culture and freedom of expression.

deliver content to a user. Such fleeting reproductions (such as copies in the cache
memory) should be seen as outside the scope of copyright protection. Requiring
permission to access temporary copies would be destructive to the operation of the
internet and harmful to the effective delivery of content and services online.

4.     Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
                                                                                            !14
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a
tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
                                              




also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
                                                                          




notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

14.        [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
           consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously
           purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
The resale of previously purchased digital content should not give rise to additional
rights, or to new legal or technical conditions which would limit the use and re-use
options of subsequent buyers. A legal framework should clearly state the exhaustion of
rights, that what can be used or re-used shall remain usable or re-usable on every
subsequent ‘second hand’ digital market. The change of use conditions should only go
towards more open conditions for users, which can strengthen legal certainty for digital
consumers, and therefore encourage further development of online commerce on
derivative digital marketplaces.
!
C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.

27
!    See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
! In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

                                                                                                                 !15
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
                                                  




to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

!
16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
!
The creation of a registration system at the EU level would be beneficial to both authors
of works and users of works. A registration system would align with the overall
objectives of EU copyright policy--that is, to “support creation and innovation, tap the
full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and
promote cultural diversity.” It would provide clear, equal access to rights information. It
would increase the certainty of who is the rightsholder to a work and provide a stable
catalog of information so that rights holders can be easily ascertained. This would help
mitigate the problem of future orphan works, as there will be a formal registry of rights
holders (however, a registration system will not be able to retroactively solve the existing
problems faced by cultural heritage institutions with regards to orphan works and mass
digitisation; see more about this in reaction to Questions 40 and 41).
As highlighted by the 2011 'New Renaissance Report’[1], future orphan works must be
avoided in order to stimulate the digitisation and online accessibility of in-copyright
material. In this purpose, registration should be considered as a precondition for a full
exercise of rights. A discussion on "refreshing" the Berne Convention on this point in
order to make it fit for the digital age should be taken up in the context of WIPO and
promoted by the European Commission. Whereas the arguments opposing registration
were essentially based on the lack of technological tools to monitor such registries,
reliable information and monitoring technologies are now available to support the
implementation of such a registration system.
!

29
!  For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
! On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             !16
If a registration system is created, rights holders should be required to register their
works in order to be granted particular protections, such as the ability to start an
enforcement action (others listed in Question 18). This change would be in line with our
policy recommendation number 8 [2]:
    In order to prevent unnecessary and unwanted protection of works of authorship, full
    copyright protection should only be granted to works that have been registered by
    their authors. Non registered works should only get moral rights protection.One of
    the unintended consequences of the near universal access to electronic publishing
    platforms is an increase in the amount of works that are awarded copyright protection
    even though their authors do not require or desire this protection. This extension of
    protection threatens to undermine the value and effectiveness of protection for works
    where copyright protection is necessary and desired. Given the above full copyright
    protection should only be granted to works that have been registered by their authors.
    Non registered works should only be granted moral rights protection. This
    recommendation requires the introduction of a registration system. Such a system
    needs to be accessible and transparent.
A registration system conditioning the modalities of protection, such as the possible legal
enforcement actions or demandable amounts for damages, would be feasible without
questioning the current principle of no formalities of access to protection as currently
provided by the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.
Such a system would be similar to what has been in force in the United-States and
accepted by other Berne country members.
Should such a registration system however be considered as calling for the revision of
the Berne rules, the European legislator should at least provide for a legal deposit
system, which can be achieved in a rapid delay, and in full conformity with the current
WIPO legal framework (as argued by Prof. Bernt Hugenholtz and Ian Hargreaves)[3].
Moreover, a registration system could provide a more efficient mechanism for
commercial licensing opportunities. Such a registration system could integrate a variety
of rights information - such as indicating open licensing for authors that wish to
distribute their works broadly under liberal terms- or including information on works
that are in the public domain. In general, a registration system will help reduce the
transaction costs between rights holders and potential users. In addition, if the
registration system were developed using open standards and formats, it would provide
a rich set of rights information as open data to be used in third party applications and
services.

17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
We believe that a registration system would be beneficial. However, the system could
present a few disadvantages. First, there is the simple fact that registration would be
required in order for the rights holder to be granted particular protections, such as the
ability to bring an enforcement action against a suspected infringer. This is not how the
current copyright enforcement system works today, at least not in all EU jurisdictions.
Second, since today it is so easy to create and share huge numbers of digital works, it
could be seen as burdensome to impose a registration requirement on authors for every
piece of content they create. At the same time, many of these same creators may not
want copyright protection (or at least do not care for copyright protection that lasts for
100+ years). So, these creators may not care to register their works, or may be selective
in registering their works. This could be seen as a positive for the copyright ecosystem.
By slightly increasing the threshold for a rights holder to receive certain types of
protection, it would decrease the number of potential copyright actions because only
those works that authors truly wish to protect would be registered. Third, it could take a
significant monetary investment to develop and implement a registration system. But in
the long run, this cost would most likely be massively outweighed by the benefits of
reducing transaction costs overall.
18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
There could be several incentives for rightholders to register their works. Policies could
be enacted whereby certain elements of copyright protection are only available to rights
holders who have registered their works. In principle this could apply to any element of
copyright protection that is not required by the Berne convention.
For example, registration might be required for a rightsholder to start an enforcement
actions (such as notice and takedown), or would be required to access a particular type
or level of damage awards in a successful infringement judgment. Another incentive
might be that rights holders need to register their works in order to be eligible to collect
royalties through collective rights management organizations. Finally, registration could
be made a prerequisite for prolonging copyright protection beyond the minimum term
required by the Berne convention (which should be progressively reduced; see our
response to Question 20).
19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
       content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
       ownership and permissions databases?
The European Union should ensure two things: (1) identifiers as well as rights
ownership and permission databases should be based on open standards, available to all
content creators and able to be read by all market participants free of charge; and (2) all
identifiers as as well as rights ownership and permission databases are interoperable
across all of Europe (and beyond).
Any system that is developed must be developed in a true multi stakeholder approach
(e.g not only by rights holders and intermediaries) and should be reflective of work
already undertaken (for example by Europeana). Rights ownership and permission
databases in particular must be publicly accessible via machine readable interfaces.

                                                                                         !18
They must also include the ability to store information on out-of-copyright (Public
Domain) works.
!
E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention31 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
                 




The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).
!
With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.
!
20.        Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
           environment?
 YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
No. Communia always had a very clear position on the appropriateness of the current
term of copyright protection. Our first policy recommendation[4] reads:
      The term of copyright protection should be reduced. The excessive length of copyright
      protection combined with an absence of formalities is highly detrimental to the
      accessibility of our shared knowledge and culture. The term of copyright protection
      should be reduced. There is no evidence that copyright protection that extends
      decades beyond the life of the author encourages the production of copyright-
      protected works. Instead the requirement to obtain permission for works by authors
      that have long died are one of the biggest obstacles for providing universal access to
      our shared culture and knowledge. Given the above the term of copyright protection
      for new works (that is works created after the term reduction) should be reduced.
More specifically, from the perspective of cultural heritage institutions, the current
terms of copyright protection (including neighbouring rights protection) must also be
considered to be too long. Cultural heritage institutions hold large collections of works
that are still under copyright (or where the copyright status is unclear) but which are
not exploited commercially anymore. A term of protection of life plus 70 years stands in
stark contrast with the commercial life of the large majority of copyright-protected

                                                                                                                 !19
works[5]. As a result, the disproportionate length of copyright protection prevents
cultural heritage institutions from effectively fulfilling their mission in the digital
environment.
In many cases the cost for digitisation of copyrighted works that are no longer being
commercially exploited exceeds the potential economic value of these works. As a result
these are not made available online by the rights holders, who lack an economic
incentive. While cultural heritage institutions that have such works in their collections
have an incentive to make such works available (their public task to provide access to
their collections) they are confronted with costs for rights clearance that increase the
overall costs for making these collection available without providing any economic
benefit to rights holders.
One of the outcomes of this is the existence of the so called ‘20th century black hole’
when it comes to online availability of copyrighted works. Works from the 20th century
are significantly less likely to be available than works from the centuries before (many of
which are clearly in the public domain) or from the 21st century (many of which are still
available commercially)[6].
Shortening the term of protection will decrease the number of works that are in
copyright but out of commercial exploitation and will thus reduce the scope of the
problems outlined above. Given this the term of copyright protection should at least be
reduced to the minimum requirement established by the Berne Convention (life of the
creator plus 50 years)[7].
In addition, the European Union should work in the relevant international fora to
further reduce the term. This should include efforts to agree on a system where extended
copyright protection after an initial automatically granted term would be only granted if
the work is registered by the rights holder. The duration of the initial term should be
brought into line with the duration of protection of other intellectual property rights,
such as patented inventions (20 years), databases (15 years), and industrial design rights
(25 years). Given this, 20 years appears to be a reasonable initial term of protection that
should guarantee protection to the vast majority of protected works. Rights holders
would have the ability to extend the term of protection for works that they intend to
exploit after the end of the initial period by registering such works.

           III.Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC32.           




Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law33. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
        




exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)34, these limitations and
                                                                                      




exceptions are often optional35, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
                                    




legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")36.  




The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.

border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                              !21
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
       provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Yes. The fact that limitations and exceptions in the EU are optional for Member States
creates an uneven playing field and legal uncertainty. Similar organisations and citizens
should be able to enjoy the same exceptions (which are actually users’ rights) in all
member states.
The current situation make copyright law more difficult to understand to users and
makes copyright policies more difficult to implement for service providers and other
intermediaries. The most comprehensive way to address this issue would be to establish
a unified EU copyright title (compare our answer to question 78).

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
       a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Yes, all existing and additional exceptions should be made mandatory and harmonised
to the fullest extent possible (obviously after they have been broadened in line with our
response to the relevant questions below). It is not acceptable that citizens in some
members state enjoy lesser level of access to works protected by copyright simply
because of an uneven implementation of exceptions and limitations of the InfoSoc
directive.
All the exceptions provided by the EU Copyright Directives are drafted on the basis that
they do not interfere with the normal exploitation of the work and, therefore, do not
unreasonably prejudice rights holders. This means that making them all mandatory in

                                                                                              !22
all member states should have no negative effect on rights holders, while in many cases
this will substantially benefit citizens and other public policy objectives such as access to
knowledge and culture or inclusive education.
Finally there is a need to protect the user rights created by limitations and exceptions
from the adverse effects of Technical Protection Measures. Circumvention of TPMs
must be allowed when exercising user rights created by Exceptions and Limitations or
when using Public Domain works and the deployment of TPMs to hinder or impede
privileged uses of a protected work or access to public domain material must be
sanctioned[8]. User rights created by exceptions and limitations should also be protected
from neutralisation by contracts, terms of use or licences, which would make impossible
to exercise such prerogatives. Thus, contracts, terms of use or licences making it
impossible to exercise rights deriving from exceptions and limitations should be declared
illegal.

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
       catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
Yes, a new exception should be added that allow non-commercial sharing of protected
works and the creation of transformative works by individuals (see our answer to
question 61). Also, the status of e-lending should be clarified (see the answers to
questions 37) possibly via a new exception. In addition cultural heritage institutions need
to be enabled to make works in their collections available online for non-commercial
purposes. As outlined in the answer to question 34 this does not require a new exception
but can be achieved by expanding the scope of the existing provision in article 5(3)n of
the directive.
Finally there is a need to introduce an open ended norm that increases the flexibility of
the current system of targeted exceptions (see next question).
!
24.   Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
      degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
 YES – Please explain why
Yes, there is a need for more flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations
and exceptions[9]. The exceptions and limitations in the 2001 Copyright Directive were
not drafted in a technologically neutral manner, which is problematic in times of
accelerated technological progress.
                                                                                          !23
!
By definition, exception and limitations that apply to specific uses cannot ensure that as
of yet unknown forms of use are covered by them. Technological innovation can be
expected to lead to new forms of use in the near future, and Europe would be well
advised to create a copyright framework that is flexible enough to deal with such
developments. The current discussion about text and data mining is a good example of
this. European researchers have to deal with legal uncertainties about the status of text
and data mining activities because the Copyright Directive fails to address this form of
use that was (relatively) unknown when the Directive was adopted. An open norm would
provide more certainty on the legal aspects of activities like text and data mining
without having to undertake legislative changes (which take years to implement).
A greater degree of flexibility is also desirable from the perspective of cultural heritage
institutions, as it should allow them to embrace new ways of making their collections
available without the need for legislative reform. Compared to institutions in countries
that have a more flexible approach to exceptions and limitations, European institutions
face a competitive disadvantage. Compare for example the scope of the Google books
project in the United States and in Europe: in Europe, Google and the libraries are only
digitising out-of-copyright works, while in the U.S. the project also includes in-copyright
titles. As a result, citizens of the U.S. have better access to their recent (20th century)
culture than European citizens. More generally users all over world have better access to
US culture than to European culture.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
       by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations
       by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing
       provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative
       advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on
       the functioning of the Internal Market.
The best approach would be one that provides built-in flexibility in reaction to new
technological developments or new forms of use. An open norm such as fair use fits this
description. It should be implemented EU-wide (see also answer to Question 22), and in
addition to (existing) targeted exceptions and limitations. This has been at the core of
our third policy recommendation[10]:
!
                                                                                            !24
    The limited list of Exceptions and Limitations established by the copyright directive
    limits the possibilities to adjust the copyright system to the rapid pace of technological
    innovation that shapes how we interact with copyright protected works. This not only
    limits the abilities of citizens to gain access to our shared culture and knowledge but
    also imposes restrictions innovative business models and as a result economic growth.
    In the absence of an open ended exceptions such as a fair use clause it is imperative
    that exceptions and limitations can be adjusted to the needs of society at large en
    innovative economic actors in particular.
Flexibility is a general civil law principle that needs to be introduced in copyright law.
By opening up the list of limitations and exceptions and making it fit technological
reality, the European legal framework would gain in systemic consistency, and allow the
balance of interests to be released from any unproductive tension.
As long as an open norm is implemented EU wide, its effect on the functioning of the
single market would be minimal, and it can be expected to improve the competitive
position of European market actors vis-a-vis market participants in other jurisdictions
that have an open norm.

26.     Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
        a problem?
 YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
The territoriality of limitations and exceptions is problematic because it is confusing to
end users when one use is covered by an exception to copyright in one jurisdiction but
when the same use is prohibited by copyright in another country. If the limitations and
exceptions are not clear, then there will be a chilling effect on reuse of content. This is
complicated by the fact that individual members states may choose which exceptions
they will adopt as national law instead of having to implement them all in a compulsory
manner.

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving37 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
                                      




matter in the collections of such institutions38. The public lending (under an exception or
                                               




limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive39.
!
                                               




Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
        problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or
        other subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
 YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
With regards to all questions in this section it should be stressed that while the
consultation document limits itself to activities of libraries and archives the questions in
this section are equally relevant for museums and other cultural heritage institutions. In
fact the relevant exceptions and limitations explicitly apply to ‘publicly accessible
libraries, educational establishments or museums, or [...] archives’. The 2012 Orphan
Works directive clarifies this to include 'film or audio heritage institutions and public-

service broadcasting organisations'. In line with this, the following answers (28-35 and
39-41) should be read as applying to all cultural heritage institutions falling within this
scope and not only to libraries and archives.
Institutions increasingly digitize works in their collections not only to prevent harm, but
to be able to better fulfil their missions. Digital copies of cultural heritage works provide
many advantages such as being (automatically) indexable, being easier to access and
having lower storage costs. The current Dutch implementation of article 5(2)c of the
Copyright Directive does not allow institutions to structurally create digital copies of
works in their collection. This prevents institutions from fully realising the potential
inherent to digitisation of their collections. This is highly detrimental in an environment
where, as the New renaissance Report[11] puts it, “digitization is more than a technical
option, it is a moral obligation”.
In addition, recital 40 of the Directive, which states that 'Such an exception or limitation
should not cover uses made in the context of online delivery of protected works or other
subject-matter', is highly problematic. As online dissemination of works becomes more
and more important for cultural heritage institutions, limiting the reproduction
exception in such a way is simply anachronistic as it prevents institutions from using
digitized works in a meaningful way.
Also, technological measures and their relationship with the exceptions benefitting
cultural heritage institutions are highly problematic: Often CDs and DVDs are
protected by technological measures, the removal of which would require the
cooperation of the producer. Art. 6 of the Infosoc Directive provides that technological
protection measures are protected per se, independently on the scope of protection,
entrusting to voluntary agreements or to subsidiary interventions of Member States the
adoption of appropriate measures to ensure that legitimate users can make effective use
of licensed content. The strength of the protection of TPMs compared with the weakness
of the provision in favor of legitimate uses has in many Member States led to the absence
of any effective guarantee for legitimate users, including libraries. As a result, many
libraries are not able to reproduce CDs and DVDs they’ve legally acquired. In several
years, these materials will become unusable due to technological obsolescence,
contributing to a black hole on 20th and early 21st century culture.

29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
The best solution would be to broaden the existing exception in article 5(2)c of the
Copyright Directive so that it allows institutions to make reproductions of all works in
their collection as long as these are not intended for direct commercial advantage. In line


                                                                                          !27
with our answer to Question 22 this exception should be made mandatory for all
Member States.

limitations and to ensure legitimate utilizations of protected works, regardless of format
or mode of dissemination.

30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
       elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and
       under which conditions?
The main element would be a broadening of the existing exception in article 5(2)c of the
Copyright Directive. Instead of only allowing specific acts of reproductions it should
allow all acts of reproduction necessary for publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments or museums, or by archives to achieve aims related to their public-
interest missions. This should include reproductions made as part of mass digitization
efforts, backup copies and reproductions for format shifting.
Reproductions should be limited to internal use which is not for direct commercial or
economic advantage or use in line with other exceptions and limitations allowed for by
the Directive (such as the broadened version of the exception foreseen in article 5(3)n
that we propose in answer to question 34). Reproductions would explicitly be allowed for
the purposes of increasing the operational efficiency and reducing costs of the
beneficiary institutions.
Broadening the scope of the exception along these lines mirrors the recommendations
made as part of the European Commission commissioned 'Study on the application of
directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in the information society' from
December 2013 (compare pages 291 to 302).
Also Art. 6 of the InfoSoc directive should be revised in order to enforce exceptions and
limitations and to ensure legitimate utilizations of protected works, regardless of format
or mode of dissemination.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
                                                                                        !28
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
       problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
       provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts
       thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
In general, libraries are subject to complex and lengthy negotiations with publishers and
database vendors, which impact collection development, duration of access, and
permitted uses. Negotiation with publishers is an expensive and time consuming process
and most licences are presented as final, without the ability to negotiate on terms, which
are often taken over from other jurisdictions.
Often libraries entrust negotiation and management of contracts to national or regional
institutional consortia to increase their bargaining power. But the use of consortia for
the negotiations is a remedy, not an optimal solution, and the logic of large numbers may
introduce rigidities in pricing and business models, encouraging the purchase of or
subscription to large packages of content rather than the selection of targeted works.
Also it is extremely common for licences to prevent cross border access to digital content
for research and study.
In more general terms this question fails to address the most urgent issue confronting
cultural heritage institutions today: providing online access to works in their collection.
Among the existing exceptions, the one providing for the consultation of works and
other subject-matter via dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for
the purpose of research and private study comes closest to a mechanism that could
enable such uses.
But from both the perspective of publicly available libraries, archives, and museums as
well as the perspective of their patrons (end users/consumers), the existing exception
that allows institutions to make works in their collections available ‘for the purpose of
research or private study, to individual members of the public by dedicated terminals on
the premises’ (article 5(3)n) is extremely limited and no longer in line with the
technological possibilities and expectations of citizens.
Limiting the availability of digitised works to dedicated terminals on the premises of
cultural heritage institutions prevents them from reaching citizens who cannot travel to
the premises (for example because they are disabled or because they lack the economic
means to do so). Furthermore it is out of line with the legitimate expectation of users
that have been shaped by universal online accessibility of other types of content and
services. Europe's citizens and researchers would greatly benefit from online access to
the collections of Europe's publicly funded institutions.
For publicly funded cultural heritage institutions to fully participate in the digital public
space, they must be enabled to offer online services that are available from everywhere

                                                                                          !29
and by anyone seeking to ‘to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy
the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits’, as enshrined by article
27.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Online universal access to the
collections of publicly accessible libraries, museums, and archives can play an important
role in realising this objective. Being able to offer online access to works in their
collections will also allow cultural heritage institutions to reach wider and more diverse
audiences. For these reasons the existing exception is too narrow.
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
The interlibrary loan between universities and national libraries is not a reality.
Procedures, when available, are very slow and cumbersome. In order to solve that
problem, libraries should be allowed to offer on their premises access to works held by
other European libraries.
From the perspective of citizens, researchers, and other end users, it does not make
sense that research libraries and publicly funded cultural heritage institutions are not
allowed to make available works in their collection that are no longer in commercial
circulation (out-of-commerce works). These institutions have built and maintained their
collections with public funds. Their mission is to provide access to the knowledge and
culture contained in these collections. As long as there are sufficient safeguards that
prevent these institutions from interfering with the normal exploitation of works in their
collection, they should be enabled to make their collections available online for non
commercial uses by the general public. Preventing institutions from doing so means that
users will look for information elsewhere (on platforms such as Wikipedia or Google).
In the long run, limiting what cultural heritage institutions can do online with out-of-
commerce works means undermining the position of these institutions. Younger
generations who have grown up with near universal online access to services will be
driven away from these trustworthy institutions.
For citizens it is perfectly understandable to not expect that cultural heritage institutions
will provide unlimited free access to works that still are in commercial circulation, but it
does not make sense at all that institutions have to restrict access to out-of-commerce
works just because they are still under copyright protection. It should be noted that this
is also true for authors who may have a legitimate interest in works that they have
created in being kept available via cultural heritage institutions and who often rely on
access to works of others as part of their own creative process.
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
The best solution would be to broaden the existing exception in article 5(3)n of the
Copyright Directive so that it allows institutions to make available digital copies of out-
of-commerce works in their collections via electronic networks such as the internet for
non commercial purposes.
!
34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
       elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and
       under which conditions?
The main element would be a broadening of the existing exception in article 5(3)n of the
Copyright Directive. Instead of limiting the making available to dedicated terminals on
the premises of the institutions, it should also apply to making the works available online
via public networks such as the internet. The scope of the exception should further be
expanded to not only include ‘the purpose of research or private study’ by ‘individual
members of the public’ but should apply to all non commercial uses.
Furthermore, It seems reasonable to limit the scope of the exception to ‘works and other
subject-matter not subject to purchase or licensing terms’ as long as they are still
commercially available. This should be combined with an opt out-clause that would
allow rights holders to either prevent the making available of their works or to negotiate
licensing terms with the institutions (either on an individual basis or collectively).
These conditions are crucial to ensure that the new broadened exception meets the
requirements of the Berne three-step test. Limiting the scope of the exception to publicly
accessible cultural heritage institutions and to out-of-commerce works and works that
are not subject to licensing terms should satisfy the 'certain special cases' criterium and
cannot, by definition, be in conflict with the 'normal exploitation' of the work in
question. The fact that the exception would be limited to non commercial uses of the
works made available and that authors can decide to opt-out of the exception would
further ensure that 'the legitimate interests of the author' are not necessarily prejudiced.
In fact, many authors would benefit from improving online access to out-of-commerce
works because works that they have created are kept available via cultural heritage
institutions (and are available to them to build upon or to do research). As a result,
citizens also greatly benefit because they are granted access to works that wouldn't be
available through market players.
This solution would also be in line with the relevant recommendations made in the 'New
Renaissance' report of the Commission appointed 'Comite de Sages' that was published
in 2011. The report recommended that 'National governments and the European
Commission should promote solutions for the digitisation of and cross-border access to
out of distribution works' and that 'For cultural institutions collective licensing solutions
and a window of opportunity should be backed by legislation, to digitise and bring out of
distribution works online, if rights holders and commercial providers do not do so’[12].

3.       E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.       (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
         when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending),
         including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
    YES – Please explain with specific examples
Libraries have faced a number of problems when attempting to negotiate agreements to
facilitate electronic lending. These include:
•     Denial of sales of electronic books to libraries by publishers;
•     Removal of content that was available for e-lending without informing the library;
•     The use of multiple licences and different models create lack of clarity on the  
      condition of access to the content for users;
•     A deterioration of registered users’ rights (crossing a border with a borrowed book
      was not a problem. Transborder online access to an electronic copy offered by a
      library is often impossible as the result of restrictive licensing conditions.
More generally the question is if it is necessary and desirable to negotiate agreements to
enable electronic lending. Contrary to what is stated in the introduction to this question
there is considerable uncertainty about the status of e-lending under EU law.
    NO

37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
The best solution for the problem would be to create legal certainty by unambiguously
including the right to e-lending in the EU aquis. While the lending of analogue works is
currently being enabled by directive 2006/115 e-lending, which is most often considered
as an act of making available, would probably need to be regulated via an (additional)
mandatory exception in the InfoSoc directive. Such a new exception could take the form
of a statutory license with fair compensation for authors.
Since e-lending must be available for all books (commercially available or not) it should
be treated separately from the general exception for making out-of-commerce works
available online that we argue for in response to question 34.
The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).
!
38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
       management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
       subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
From the perspective of cultural heritage institutions, there are enormous differences
between physical and online collections. These differences are so fundamental that it
does not make sense to compare the two. The ability to offer access to their collections
online frees cultural heritage institutions from many of the constraints imposed by them
by the properties of analogue media and physical infrastructure (such as buildings).
Being able to offer access to collections online means that in theory access can be
provided to full collections independent from the location of the viewer or the time of the
day. This has the potential to radically improve the ability of publicly funded cultural
heritage institutions to carry out their public mission to provide access to knowledge and
culture.
Unfortunately this enormous potential is currently being held back by copyright rules
that unnecessarily restrict how cultural heritage institutions can exercise their mission in
the online environment. Under the current EU copyright rules, cultural heritage
institutions are dependent on permission from rights holders in order to make protected
works in their collection available online. As we have argued above, this makes no sense
in situations where the majority of works held by these institutions are not even
commercially available.
With the increasing digitisation of our society (and media production in particular), this
has other, potentially far reaching consequences. For example, library can buy all
physical publications to ensure that they are available to the public both during the
period of their commercial availability and thereafter.
The same is not true for digital publications, which are not being sold, but licensed. And
currently libraries cannot buy licences to all commercially available content because
rights holders are free to decide whether they want to give access to a specific work (and
who also can decide on the terms for such access). Often such conditions make it
impossible to keep such works indefinitely or to make them available to the community

                                                                                             !33
by lending them out. The consequence of this is that the content collection policies of
libraries are increasingly determined by publishers and not by the institutions
themselves. In the long run, this development threatens to undermine the core function
of cultural heritage institutions to preserve the knowledge and culture of our societies
and to keep it available to the public.
With regards to the above the 'study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC on
copyright and related rights in the information society' that was commissioned by the
European Commission and published in december 2013[12] contains an interesting
observation. At the end of the section discussing inter alia the exception benefitting
cultural heritage institutions, the authors observe that:
     "The large-scale digitization projects ultimately aim at the making available of the
     collection, [...] the making available for consultation is increasingly requested to
     apply at distance and online; and the lending is shifting to cover the online
     transmission of digital items. The exception-by-exception reasoning, which is the
     model of the InfoSoc Directive, might not be relevant anymore. Maybe it is time to
     look at different uses that some categories of users (libraries or educational
     institutions) or some objectives (access to culture and knowledge or education) would
     be privileged to undertake under a limitation of copyright. [...] the space of non-
     infringing uses could be defined by their objective and some general conditions,
     including a more open requirement that the use does not exceed what is necessary for
     its objective. This is a radical move that this study has not made. It could make our
     system of exceptions more fit for its purpose and understandable for users and
     copyright owners alike. If the requirements for each exception are adequate and
     legitimate, it would not sacrifice the high level of protection of copyright and related
     rights that the EU law has adopted."

4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with

                                                                                                !34
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other40. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
                                            




projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)41.           




40.     [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
        digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it
        be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the
        2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)
        have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the
        EU?
 YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
From the perspective of cultural heritage institutions this question (and the following)
are too limited. The issue of mass digitisation is far broader than what can be addressed
with the 2011 MoU and the 2012 Orphan works directive (the other relevant European
policy instrument in this area). Copyright issues related to the mass digitisation of
collections and the subsequent making available of digitised works require a
comprehensive approach that cannot be based the principles of due diligence search and
licensing. If we want to enable European cultural heritage institutions to transfer their
collections into the digital age (and there cannot be any doubt that this is both an
important policy objective and a reasonable expectation of users who as taxpayers fund
these organisations) we need a far more comprehensive approach.
In the questions above we have outlined such an approach. that would provide cultural
heritage institutions a clear legal framework for operating in the digital environment
that would allow us to to achieve the aims related to our public-interest missions. Under
this approach the online activities of cultural heritage institutions would be covered by

41.      Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other
         types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
    YES – Please explain
This is certainly necessary. The public has a legitimate interest in having online access to
the collections of all publicly accessible libraries, museums and archives across Europe
(see article 27.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights). There is no good reason
for limiting mechanisms that create such access to certain types of content. The
approach proposed in reaction to questions 40 and 34 above, would cover all types of
works and other subject matter that are held by these institutions.
 
This solution would also be in line with the relevant recommendation made in the 'New
Renaissance' report of the Commission appointed 'Comite de Sages' that was published
in 2011. The report recommended that 'solutions for orphan works and out of
distribution works must cover all the different sectors: audiovisual, text, visual arts,
sound’[13].

B.      Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC42 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
                              




limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
        experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
        illustration for teaching, including across borders?
Yes
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
 YES – Please explain
Yes. As noted by the European Commission in the introductory message above, the
educational exception in the directive is already broad and should be interpreted as
allowing for the inclusion of all types of works for illustration of teaching.
The problem is that none of the Member States have implemented the exception as
broadly as allowed by the Copyright Directive. Thus the permitted use of works in
education differs between the Member States. This presents special difficulties for the
providers of online open courses that can be accessed by citizens of various member
states. Also in many Member States the exception is unfit for the digital age as it does
not cover the uses of online works for the illustration of teaching. For example, this is
the case in Poland where the exception is limited to educational establishments. It is
therefore often interpreted that any use of copyrighted material beyond the physical
premises of such establishments is prohibited. Another example is France, where the
exception for educational use is also narrow and dependant of sectoral agreements
negotiated with the national collecting societies, which are imposing too many
restrictions. For instance, it excludes works designed for educational purposes, music
scores and works made for a digital edition of the written. It is ill-suited to the digital
environment to authorize to use paper editions only. It also imposes quantitative
limitations which do not make any sense neither for text-work, as they benefit already
from the exceptions of quotation which does not require a compensation, nor for non-
text works as it forbids for instance to show a movie.

Throughout the EU, issues of cross-border access to copyrighted education content is
even more complex. For example, copyrighted materials are used in massive open online
courses (MOOCs) that are accessible to all citizens of the EU and often administered by
consortia of educational institutions established in several Member States. There is clear
need for harmonization as Member States provide for different sorts of educational
exceptions allowing (or not) digital uses.
The issue not only concerns the types of uses permissible under specific Member State
educational exceptions, but also the aspect of applicable law. For courses that involve
making works available online, it is uncertain the laws of which Member State would be
applicable to the act of making available. The Court of Justice case law considers a few
factors such as the country of establishment, the country of upload, and the country to
which the activity is directed. In the case of an online course that is conducted by
educational institutions based in Several Member states, it is never fully possible to
determine whose law applies.
    The major differences in national laws bring legal uncertainty. There is a need to
    seek uniform solutions, if not at international at least at community level, in order to
    really harmonize the internal market and to avoid its fragmentation. Otherwise fear
    will govern on both sides: the educational institutions would seek licenses for uses
    that need not to be licensed (and maybe they will be refused), and the rights holders
    will be reluctant to grant license for online uses. Even the public policy for education
    will be uncertain, since the market power will rule (in the form of unreasonable
    prices and conditions, prohibition to use material online, and the like)[14].
The other issue that is addressed in more detail in the general part of this submission is
the intersection between exceptions and limitations to copyright and technical protection
measures. It is true in education as well as in any other areas to which exceptions and
limitations apply that TPMs and restrictive licensing prohibit permitted uses.
    In the absence of clear guidelines in the law, the temptation is big for rights owners to
    determine the extent to which the dissemination of knowledge can take place
    exclusively through contractual arrangements, which restrict the acts normally
    allowed under the statutory exceptions and limitations.

43.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?



                                                                                                !38
The problems would best be solved by making the educational exception mandatory for
all the Member States while clearly defining its specific provisions leaving no room for
narrow implementations, as recommended in Question 45 below.
In addition, the educational sector provides another example of the need for simple, easy
to understand copyright rules (compare our answer to question 10 above). While
educational uses are covered by targeted exceptions in all member states, it is our
repeated experience that both education professionals and students struggle with
determining what types of use they can make without obtaining prior permission from
rights holders. These experiences are mirrored by the Hargreaves report[16], which
observes:
  Many university academics – along with teachers elsewhere in the education sector –
  are uncertain what copyright permits for themselves and their students.
  Administrators spend substantial sums of public money to entitle academics and
  research students to access works which have often been produced at public expense
  by academics and research students in the first place. (…) Senior figures and
  institutions in the university sector have told the Review of the urgent need reform
  copyright to realise opportunities, and to make it clear what researchers and
  educators are allowed to do.
Therefore, in addition to the legislative solution outlined below in Question 45, the
popularization and distribution of knowledge within the member states with respect
of the scope of educators’ rights is an important goal.

www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf
44.    What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
       illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
The mechanisms exists and are well-known to the Commission. They had been
recognized by the Commission in the Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge
Economy and very recently re-collected in the Study on the application of Directive
2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in the information society.
The solutions involve extended collective licensing or agreements with publishers on
national levels. But these create legal uncertainty for the educational establishments,
since there is a risk that no agreement or a restricted one will be reached (e.g. in
Denmark no agreement has been reached on digital copying between the collective
rights societies and educational institutions, apart from one with teacher training
colleges, and in France the exception to use parts of books adds restrictions which did
not exist previously). They also add to inconsistency of use of works across Member
States for educational purposes. The mechanisms are counter-effective. Educational
establishments seek licenses for uses that may not require to be licensed. On the other
hand, the rights holders prohibit certain permitted uses by employing DRMs or
imposing restrictive contractual clauses.
45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
       elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and
       under what conditions?

                                                                                              !39
A legislative solution on the EU level is needed, perhaps in the form of a regulation
rather than a Directive. Any process should be conducted carefully so as not to lose or
alter the currently broad and open educational exception.
!
The mandatory educational exception should cover all uses of all types of works for
illustration of teaching. It should not be limited to any types of institution, but rather
defined by its purpose: teaching. All types of educational establishments are deemed to
be included under the exception’s scope regardless of their source of financing: public or
private as long as the purpose of educational activity is non-commercial.
!
The exception should allow for use of any copyrighted material, including text, film,
multimedia for illustration of teaching in classrooms as well as in distance learning. It
should also allow for using copyrighted works in teaching compilations, whether they be
analogue or digital.
!
The no license and no compensation model is recommended, meaning that the uses for
illustration of teaching should not require the consent (license) or remuneration to rights
holders. However, fair compensation may be needed in order to satisfy the three-step
test, especially where the exempted uses concern works made available for e-learning
purposes, for example in massive open online courses. It is our view that the levies
should be paid by the educational institution (running a course or engaged in
organization of a course) located in the country where the uploading of the educational
materials takes place. Fair distribution of the sums collected should be assured.
!
If the educational exception remains non-mandatory and fragmented among Member
States, then it would be necessary to clearly define the law governing cross-border e-
learning activities. It seems appropriate to point to the law governing the right to make
works available which in turn should be defined following the Satellite and Cable
directive approach of the country of origin principle. In the case of the making available
right, the country of origin should be the country where the act of uploading takes place
(as in the case of broadcasts it is the country of the uplink of a broadcast to a satellite).
Clearly the making available right is akin to the right of communication to the public
via satellite. Whatever the drawbacks of the country of origin principle may be (as
detailed in the Study), it has been functioning in the EU in the context of Sat/Cab
Directive for close to a decade and there is a body of case law to rely on..

         experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in
         the context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
 YES – Please explain
Yes. Modern research is conducted in the digital environment, thus by definition there is
an international cross-border dimension. Researchers exchange scientific papers and
materials online, they use text and data mining tools in order to extract specific
knowledge from large datasets, as noted in the Hargreaves review[17]:
     Researchers want to use every technological tool available, and they want to develop
     new ones. However, the law can block valuable new technologies, like text and data
     mining, simply because those technologies were not imagined when the law was
     formed.
Research is covered by the same exception as teaching. However, these activities are
significantly different. Researchers use works and other subject matter by way of
illustration, as the teaching exception requires. But in the digital environment,
researchers also extract excerpts from them, incorporate extracts of data into their tools
for data mining, and conduct virtual experiments and other forms of digital
manipulation.
!
As the exception covers only non-commercial research, problems can arise when there
are questions about whether the research conducted could be interpreted as being of a
commercial nature. For example, does publicly funded research carried out by a private
company, for instance a member of an FP7 project, qualify for the exception? Does
research conducted by a university leading to a patent application fall under the
exception?

48.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Apart from a legislative solution as outlined below, the access problems could be solved
by implementing open access principles. As recommended by the Commission[18], the
results of publicly funded research projects should be published in open access models.
The Commission should further promote and encourage open access models such as in
the Horizon 2020 research framework programme and beyond[19]. There is also a need
to promote among researchers and publishers data awareness and a culture of sharing.
It may be done by establishing mechanisms and processes to recognize, reward, and
possibly even require good data sharing practices[20].
In terms of a legislative solution, it is recommended to introduce a separate exception for
research. The exception should be made mandatory and its scope clarified. The current
provision leads to legal uncertainty and abuse by rights holders. It should remain
functional in its nature, i.e. it should not extend to particular beneficiaries, but be
defined by its purpose: conducting research. It should extend to works, the subject
matter of related rights, computer programs, and databases. The uses allowed for
research should not be limited by way of illustration, and should cover a wide range of
uses in order to enable unrestricted digital research. Scientists must be free to subject
any article published or made available online to data mining, extractions, variations, or
other digital manipulations provided they give proper attribution under the norms of
scholarly research. The exception should cover commercial or non-commercial activities.
If necessary for political reasons, the uses for the purpose of commercial research
(guidelines on the meaning of commercial should be provided) could be subject to fair
compensation, but the levies should be low and well-administered.
As this is the case for all limitations and exceptions, the legal measures must be taken in
order to prevent contractual overrides and TPM blocking of permitted research uses.
The above legislative approach stressing the need for a broad exception for scientific
research has been proposed and substantiated by the Max Planck Institute for
Intellectual Property, Competition and Tax Law in its above mentioned response to the
Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy, and further defined and
supported by Reichmann and Okediji in Empowering the Digitally Integrated Scientific
Research, the Pivotal Role of Copyrights’ Exceptions and Limitations[21], 2009. That
latter paper was presented to the Commission during the consultations of the Green
Paper.

49.     What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
        research purposes? How successful are they?
Some member states use extended collective licensing mechanisms to cover research
activities. Publishers offer individual licenses to allow for text and data mining. The
drawbacks of such mechanisms are the same as described for the mechanisms in the
teaching exception (Question 44).
There are open access principles promoted and implemented on the European level. It
appears that the movement towards open access will continue within the scientific
research space. However, as noted above in Question 48, there is a need for formulating
policies that would encourage implementations of         open access and sharing of
knowledge.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC44 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
                              




a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 45.      




The Marrakesh Treaty46 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
                                  




who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

       content, including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of
       this exception?
 YES – Please explain by giving examples
Organizations representing persons with disabilities often have problems with access to
content. One of their goals is to provide persons with disabilities with access to works in
accessible formats, however they have problems with accessing content and reproducing
it in accessible formats. When asking newspaper editors for access to online editions of
their newspapers to make them accessible online for people with disabilities, the editors
usually decline and do not allow access. This applies both to domestic and cross-border
editors.
People with disabilities themselves also encounter problems with accessing content in
digital form. This content is sometime locked or in formats, which do not allow access
with equipment for people with disabilities, which means that they cannot access the
content at all.
This is also the case with the majority of websites, which are also not accessible to people
with disabilities for the reasons stated above. What is most concerning is the lack of
access to the most websites of government bodies, which provide access to public
information.
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
 YES – Please explain by giving examples
There are problems with distributing works which have been reproduced in special formats
on the basis of an exception or limitation of copyright, because the legislation in this field is
not clear. While many countries do provide limitations or exceptions to copyright for
persons with disabilities, which allows them to make copies of works in accessible formats,
almost none of them are clear on whether or not cross-border exchange of works produced
in accessible formats using this exception or limitation are allowed. Due to this,
organizations are not sure if such distribution would infringe on authors rights and do not
engage in such actions. This in turn means that the market is very closed for such works
and that persons with disabilities do not have the full access to works.
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the distribution/
communication of works published in special formats, including across borders?

51.    If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
The recently adopted Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for
Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled is a step in the
right direction. However, since this treaty is not in force, a EU instrument should be

                                                                                              !44
enacted to unify the legislation of the member states in this field. This instrument should
provide an exception or limitation of copyright in favor of these persons.
Firstly, any exceptions and limitations of copyright should be intended for all disabled
people, who due to the nature of their disability have a limited or no access to published
works, not only for the blind and visually impaired.
The exception or limitation should apply to all published works, not merely literary
works, as per example, persons who are blind also need access to visual materials, such
as pictures, graphs, diagrams, etc. as well as audiovisual works.
The exception should allow the reproduction and distribution and also the making
available of works, however the rights of adaptation and public performance are also
crucial. The adaptation right would enable the beneficiary to adapt certain works to
enable access, eg. diagrams in a textbook could be described so that a blind person could
have access to them. Public performance would enable public recitations of literary
works for disabled people. The exception should also specifically enable cross-border
exchange of works in accessible formats. This would ensure that more persons with
disabilities have access to works in accessible formats and also ensure that there is truly
an open European market.
This exception or limitation of copyright should be without the need to pay
remuneration. The main reason is, that organizations that mostly deal with providing
persons with disabilities works in accessible formats do this on a non-profit and
voluntary basis and thus cannot afford to pay remuneration for such actions. It is
important to note, that these organizations also provide their services free of charge.
!
52.    What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
       How successful are they?
There are copyright exceptions and limitations in place, which potentially allow for
access to works and use of work for disabled people. Copyright exceptions are provided
for in very general terms in international conventions, such as the Berne Convention,
the Rome Convention, TRIPS, WPPT, WCT, etc. and as implemented in national
legislations are not very clear and are severely limited by conditions of exceptions and
limitations which are not adapted to new technologies and global communication
systems.
On the European level, the Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related
rights in the information society determines that “/.../ Member States may provide for
exceptions or limitations to the rights provided for in Articles 2 and 3 in the following
cases: /.../ (b) uses, for the benefit of people with a disability, which are directly related to
the disability and of a non-commercial nature, to the extent required by the specific
disability;/.../”
Accordingly, the Member States are free to decide whether or not to implement such
exceptions or limitations. Should they decide to implement it, they can form the
exception in almost anyway, as there are no guidelines that would unify the adoption of

                                                                                              !45
such limitation or exception. Because of this, the system is not harmonized and no tvery
effective.
There is a great need for a European instrument, which would unify and clearly define
what is allowed and what is not and would adapt the exception and limitation to new
technologies. This would also make any cross-border access to materials much easier,
which is now very complicated due to the differences in the legislations of the Member
States.

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics47 are different terms used to describe
                                                                   




increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”48. In the context of these discussions,
                                                                       




other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

 YES – Please explain
Yes, since in most cases it is necessary to make a copy of the content in order for a
machine to extract facts and data for mining, the act of text and data mining there is a
lot of uncertainty among users of online services provided by cultural heritage
institutions that want to make use of text and data mining. Because it restricts the
copying of large portions of databases, the Database Directive may also a legal barrier to
text and data mining. Although text and data mining is concerned with the extraction of
facts and data and as such should not be subject to an exclusive right, the results of text
and data mining research are currently being suppressed because of a lack of legal
clarity.
We observe that the resulting legal uncertainties create a situation where the wealth
information that is available online (often produced and made available by publicly
funded institutions) is not fully accessible to researchers employing text and data mining
technologies.

 NO OPINION
!
54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Text and data mining should be considered as an extension of the right to read. Text and
data mining should certainly not be treated with a contractual approach which would
try to license for a fee this usage in addition to the right of access.
!
55.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
       elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
If Text and Data mining would be authorized by a copyright exception, it would
constitute a de facto recognition that Text and Data mining are not legitimate usages. We
believe that mining texts and Data for facts is an activity that is not and should not be
protected by copyright and therefore introducing a legislative solution that takes the
form of an exception should be avoided.

                                                                                          !47
!
56.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
It is required to clarify that they are unregulated usages and part of the prerogatives
which can be exercised once the right to access content has been cleared through a
license or is otherwise available to the user for another reason such as an exception.
!
57.       Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
          text or data mining methods?
Terms of use imposed by content providers can be a barrier to text or data mining.
Terms of use prohibiting the lawful right to perform data mining on a content accessed
legitimately should be considered an abuse of exclusive rights and declared illegal. Also,
technical restrictions to download the content in an open format will also be considered
a barrier to data mining and their circumvention should not be considered a breach of
terms of use, of copyright, or of effective rights protection measure.
!
F.        User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs49. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
       




even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders

49
! A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           !48
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions50.        




58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
        when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new
        content on the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
 YES – Please explain by giving examples
Current EU legislation does not structurally allow citizens to share remixes and
mashups of pre-existing works online, even in non-commercial contexts and when only
very minor parts of works are re-used. This stands in stark contrast with everyday
practices of large parts of the population. The fact that european citizens are able to
express themselves via transformative uses of protected material is not due to exceptions
guaranteeing this fundamental rights but to an opaque mix of licensing arrangements
(concluded by platform providers with rights holders) and selective enforcement of
rights.
From our perspective this situation is highly undesirable. As long as they do so without a
commercial motivation, citizens should have the right to express themselves in any
media and to make transformative uses of protected materials in doing so. Citizens
should not only be allowed to make private copies of material that they have access to
but they should also have the right to share protected works for non-commercial
purposes.

would provide sufficient room for citizens to express themselves. Such an exception
could either be a new one or an extension of the scope of an existing one such as the
exception for the benefit of quotations (as foreseen in article 5(3)d of the InfoSoc
directive).

       IV. Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying51. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
                   




purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5253.             




There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments57.

        V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers58 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
                                              




work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract59. This is an
                                                                                  




area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.
!
72.        [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
           combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration
           for the exploitation of your works and performances?
While this consultation is about copyright and copyright is not about developing
legislation-based business models for the authors and performers, we believe that the
position of authors and performers can be improved by strengthening their rights vis a
vis publishers and other distributors of their work. Authors and performers should have
the ability to regain control of works that they have assigned to third parties if those
third parties do not actively exploit their works (anymore). Such a non-usus clause can
for example be found in the changes to the dutch copyright act that is currently pending
in dutch parliament.
!
Also authors of scientific articles and other short works (such as contributions to
proceeding of academic proceedings should have the (time delayed) right to publish such
works in an open access publication that cannot be waived or transferred to another
party such as a Scientific publisher. Such clauses aimed at ensuring public access to

publicly funded academic research can be found in the german copyright law and in the
proposed revisions to the dutch copyright act that is currently pending in dutch
parliament.
!
73.     Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
        contracts)?
 YES – Please explain
!
Given that the European Union is currently promoting open access to publicly funded
research as part of the Horizon2020 program it seems reasonable to create the legal
conditions that ensure that authors of academic works can fulfill their open access
obligations even when they also work with scientific publishers. In addition and in line
with our previous answers we believe that any other measure to improve the standing of
authors and performers vis a vis publishers and other distributors can best be
strengthened at the EU level. Clauses forbidding to self-archive a scientific work in an
open access repository should be declared illegal. Clauses imposing the transfer of rights
in all areas and languages while the publisher is not actively working

      VI.Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE60 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
                           




intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text61. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
                                       




provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of

60
!  Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.

copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose62. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
                                                   




of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure63. At the same time, there could be clarification of the
                                               




safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.     Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
        infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain
No, Respect for rights is not created by enforcement, but by establishing rules that are
perceived as fair and balanced by as many people as possible. The most effective way to
improve respect for rights would be to take user concerns seriously when addressing the
other issues identified throughout our answers to the entire consultation. Copyright
holders have ample means to enforce their rights. At the same time social acceptance of
copyright rules remains low and citizens obtain content from unauthorized sources.
Any system that seeks to improve respect for the rules that it establishes needs to ensure
that the rules are well balanced and perceived as fair by all stakeholders (or at least a
majority of the stakeholders directly affected by these rules). The recent explosion of
digital technologies has meant that citizens and professionals that were previously
situated outside of the reach of the copyright system are now affected by the system in
their day to day actions and professional activities. As we have outlined in our answers
to the questions III we do not believe that the legitimate interests of citizens and many
professionals are adequately expressed by the existing copyright laws. This perception of
copyright as a system that imposes unjust limits on citizens and professionals, combined
with the fact that the current systems is overly complex, undermines acceptance of the
system.
In our answers to the questions above we have proposed a number of modifications to
the system that have the potential to, once implemented, increase the social acceptance
of the system as a whole. Without these much needed changes the system risks to
alienate even larger groups of stakeholders which will even further undermine respect
for the rights of creators.

 NO OPINION

76.     In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
        involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising

62
! For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
63
! This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                          !56
       brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
       online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures
       would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
The limitation of intermediaries’ liability is important and is a cornerstone of the
functioning of the Internet. Without it, there is a high risk of censorship and of going
against freedom of expression, freedom of communication but also freedom to conduct a
business. Middlemen should not be made liable and privatised enforcement is not the
solution.
!
77.    Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
       achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such
       as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?
 YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain
No, the current civil enforcement framework is tilted towards the interests of
rightholders. As mentioned above there is a need for more balanced copyrights rules
that can easily be understood (and followed) by all stakeholders. As long as this is not
the case a renewed focus on enforcement measures will only further undermine the
social acceptance of the system as a whole.
 NO OPINION

       VII.A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.
!
78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
       of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across
       the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 YES
The establishment of a single EU Copyright Title would be a positive step forward for
both rightholders and users of copyrighted content. It would help to harmonize the
currently disjointed limitations and exceptions and copyright duration schemes across
the EU.

                                                                                           !57

79.     Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
        current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a
        longer term project?
Pursuing the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title should be the next step. Work
on this should begin immediately.

      VIII.Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.
!
80.     Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
        copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
In addition to the reforms discussed above, as a general matter, the EU should support
rights holders who wish to dedicate their copyrights to the public domain or sharing
under an open licensing scheme. These rights holder groups are an important and
growing constituency whose interests should be duly taken into account by
policymakers. The issue of the voluntary dedication of rights to the public domain by
their owners is on the work agenda of the Committee on Development and Intellectual
Property (CDIP) of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). As a WIPO
permanent observer, COMMUNIA encourages the international copyright community
to commit further study to the legal framework applicable to voluntary non-
protection[22].
!
This reflection should be concretely echoed on the legislative level with the introduction
of a positive legal definition of the public domain in copyright rules. The link between
copyright protection and the public domain has evolved over time, and needs to be
clarified by legislation. The role of the public domain, already crucial in the past, is even
more important today, as the Internet and digital technologies enable us to access, use
and re-distribute information with a marginal cost of zero. It has thus become necessary
to reform the copyright system to recognize the existence of the public domain as a
positive set of content that can be freely used to serve culture, innovation and public
service purposes, in complementary with exclusive protection[23].
