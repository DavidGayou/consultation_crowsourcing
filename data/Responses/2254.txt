     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" 1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework 2 3 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4 . The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions 5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy" 6 , the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works" 7 and "Content Online" 8 . These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law 9 .
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management 10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11 ; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe” 12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition 13 .
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability 14 .
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term 15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)

2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
If content is offered via online platforms and the content is not licensed under Creative
Commons Licenses, it is difficult to respond to questions of users and inform them what
they may or may not do with the content provided via the services, as a fair use doctrine
or limitations to copyright in other countries are similar, but may differ from local law.

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
YES – Please explain
Market-led solutions (as discussed during the Licences for Europe process) prove to be
unable to fulfil the needs of libraries and other cultural institutions [see EBLIDA
statement posted on 13 November 2013 at http://www.eblida.org/news/press-release-
licences-4-europe-plenary-on-13-november.html]. There is a need of adapting the
copyright framework to the digital era in which the public non-commercial sector
(ranging from libraries, archives and cultural heritage institutions) plays a core role in
giving access to information. Cross-border access to online resources are of first
importance for libraries and cultural institutions because of the need of citizens that are
students, researchers and the general public: “As most knowledge creation and transfer
use digital means, all barriers preventing seamless online access to digital research
services for collaboration, computing and accessing scientific information (e-Science)
and to infrastructures must also be removed by promoting a digital ERA. The different
types of knowledge transfer, circulation and access should also be judiciously factored
into research cooperation with non-EU countries” (Communication from the
Commission A Reinforced European Research Area Partnership for Excellence and
Growth, 17.07.2012, p. 13). The full exploitation of digital opportunities should be
supported by a progressive and flexible approach to copyright rules at EU level that
could built up on the best existing legal solutions.
Until now, cross-border access to online resources is mainly based on reciprocal
agreements between institutions, but doesn’t fall under a clear and unified set of rules.
The differences in the implementation of the Directive 2001/29/EC, especially of the list
of exceptions, create uncertainty in the application of the law and extreme complexity.
When the EU would like to be closer to its citizen, rules need to be easy to understand,
applicable throughout the whole territory and flexible enough to adapt to new uses. The
increased number of foreign students, as well as the free movements of citizens across
the EU encourage information sharing and should foster cross-border access to content,
especially the widest possible access to European Cultural Heritage (as mentioned in the
COMITÉ DES SAGES report The New Renaissance, Report of the Reflection group on
bringing          Europe’s          cultural         heritage         online,      2011,

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC 16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software 17 and databases 18 .
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders 19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies 20 , (notably relevant at the start of the transmission
– e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available –
and at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks 21 . These rights are intrinsically linked in
digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public 22 . According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online

16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined

service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
      YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach 23 )
NO. The essence of the internet is that any posted content without specific measures
limiting access is to be as widely available as possible, the essence of research is to
address an international community which works in countries all across the globe.
Information made available online may target a special audience but the character of
the internet is to not limit access. Introducing such a restrictions due to copyright
regulations based on pre-internet considerations would be a policy strongly opposed by
the research community. Many research publications typically have a small audience.
But all authors would like to reach the widest possible audience. Therefore, asking
authors or publishers to specify the targeted audience would not be constructive.
The internet is used by professional publishers and laymen. The legal requirements need
to be articulated in such a way that non-experts can understand what is authorised or
not. Rights clearance in respect to the making available right should only be necessary
in the country of origin.

9.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial
scope of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights
(e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered

of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief 24 )?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                             12
Researchers receive no or little income from their publications, and therefore direct
remuneration for publication is not a real incentive for them. Being as widely read and
cited as possible is more important as they evolve in an economy of reputation.
Researchers are expected to publish their research results in order to disseminate the
knowledge they have built through their activities. Publications are a key element of
their CV as they demonstrate the results of their work, and play an important role in
grant applications and career progression. In this context, many researchers reluctantly
accept publishing contracts which require them to transfer their copyright in full,
without receiving monetary compensation. Any regulation which would add barriers
and stop the publications to reach the broadest possible audience is therefore not
supporting the research enterprise, and mainly results in increased revenues for
publishers.




2.     Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
YES
Specific acts of digital reproduction made by libraries for their services are covered by
the exception 5(2)(c) of the InfoSoc Directive (at least for documents owned by libraries).
But in the digital environment many typical library services such as lending, inter-
library loan, document supply, involve the transmission by electronic means, which is
subject to the making available right. And, according to the prevailing interpretation, in
such cases the exception provided by art. 5(1) (temporary acts of reproduction which
have no independent economic significance), which is still an exception to the right of
reproduction, is not applicable. The “making available to the public” right needs to be
easily understood and used and therefore should include a licence to permanently store
a local copy and to adapt this copy according to the needs arising due to technical
development, e.g. transfer to new storage media, making copies necessary for archiving
purposes, format changes. See also answer to Q24, Q32 and Q39.


                                                                                                13
3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU 25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU 26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
Using hyperlinks is of great importance for researchers and a commonly accepted
practice when sharing information on the Internet. Whilst greater clarity on the use of
hyperlinks would be welcome, establishing formal legal restrictions would be unlikely to
benefit the dissemination of research results, and would undermine the great potential
of the Internet to link relevant information together and increase discoverability. A
hyperlink is just an electronic pointer or reference, and not something that has required
any intellectual input as normally it is generated automatically, so as such it is not
protected by copyright.
Linking is a basic function for the internet. It is comparable to a road or roadsign
showing the way to a building. On the internet a link makes a resource
accessible/available to users without knowing the URL (comparable to GPS-data of a
building). It does not reproduce the resource. It should not be subject to a special
permission. The person or entity providing the resource via their website can still decide
whether or not to make it available to the public, even though they cannot prevent
others from linking to their website.

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
This authorisation should be considered being given by the act of making the work
available online.
Content legally accessible on the Internet should be considered exempted of
authorisation of the right holder by default.
The purpose of the Internet is the communication to the public. In this situation, there
shouldn’t be any request of rightholders authorisation.

4.        Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article) 27 . The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 28 . This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
The problem is that any kind of use of digital content are entirely dependent on the rules
set by the publisher, operating by licenses and technological protection measures.
Cultural content, whatever the form of distribution, should be treated by the law for
what they are - content and not temporary services.

  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
The original copy which was downloaded is not traceable and it will be impossible to
identify the legal copies from the illegally produced additional copies of the purchased
digital object (such as films and journal articles, etc.).
But the current prices for digital content are too high if they cannot be passed on to
other users and are subject to digital rights management devices.

C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute 29 . Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered 30 .

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
     NO
     NO OPINION


16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
The copyright term of works which are considered of low economic value could be
greatly shortened to the benefit of society.
Identification of copyright owners would be facilitated as has been pointed out in the
discussion on orphaned works already.
The creation of a registration system at the EU level would be beneficial to both authors
of works and users of works. A registration system would align with the overall
objectives of EU copyright policy--that is, to “support creation and innovation, tap the
full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and

29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             16
promote cultural diversity.” It would provide clear, equal access to rights information.
It would increase the certainty of who is the rightsholder to a work and provide a stable
catalog of information so that rightsholders can be easily ascertained. This would help
mitigate the problem of orphan works for future works, as there will be a formal
registry of rightsholders. A registration system could provide a more efficient
mechanism for commercial licensing opportunities. And such a registration system
could integrate a variety of rights information--such as indicating open licensing for
authors that wish to distribute broadly under liberal terms--or including information on
works that are in the public domain. In general, a registration system will help reduce
the transaction costs between rightsholders and potential users. And if the registration
system were developed using open standards and formats, it would provide a rich set of
rights information as open data to be used in third party applications and services.


If a registration system is created, rightsholders should be required to register their
works in order to be granted particular protections, such as the ability to start an
enforcement action (others listed in Question 18). This change would be key “in order to
prevent unnecessary and unwanted protection of works of authorship” and decrease the
“huge number of works that are awarded copyright protection even though their
authors do not require or desire this protection.” (Recommendation 8 of the
International Communia Association, http://www.communia-
association.org/recommendations-2/).



17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
Uninteded loss of copyright.
There could be a few disadvantages of a registration system. First, there is the simple
fact that registration would be required in order for the rightsholder to be granted
particular protections, such as the ability to bring an enforcement action against a
suspected infringer. This is not how the current copyright enforcement system works
today, at least not in all EU jurisdictions. Second, since today it is so easy to create and
share huge numbers of digital works, it could be seen as burdensome to impose a
registration requirement on authors for every piece of content they create. At the same
time, many of these same creators may not want copyright protection (or at least do not
care for copyright protection that lasts for 100+ years). So, these creators may not care
to register their works, or may be selective in registering their works. This could be seen
as a positive for the copyright ecosystem. By slightly increasing the threshold for a
rightsholder to receive certain types of protection, it would decrease the number of
potential copyright actions because only those works that authors truly wish to protect
would be registered. Third, it could take a significant monetary investment to develop
and implement a registration system. But in the long run, this cost would most likely be
massively outweighed by the benefits of reducing transaction costs overall.

association.org/recommendations-2/#8




                                                                                          17
It is easier to identify copyrightable objects without registration, as the copyrightability
of an object can be judged by just looking at the object itself. No additional information
must be sought from third parties.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
There could be several incentives for rightholders to register their works. Policies could
be enacted whereby certain elements of copyright protection are only available to
rightholders who have registered their works. In principle this could apply to any
element of copyright protection that is not required by the Berne convention. Disputes
concerning copyright ownership could be settled earlier such increasing the chances to
get hold of the necessary proof to support a claim of copyright.


For example, registration might be required for a rightsholder to start an enforcement
actions (such as notice and takedown), or would be required to access a particular type
or level of damage awards in a successful infringement judgment. Another incentive
might be that rightholders need to register their works in order to be eligible to collect
royalties through collective rights management organizations. Finally, registration could
be made a prerequisite for prolonging copyright protection beyond the minimum term
required by the Berne convention. But in no case should registration lead to any further
extension of the present EU copyright term.


All this, however, would require an extensive information to all potential stakeholders,
so that: a) the authors are able to exercise their rights and these rights are not usurped
by those who register first; b) the public and the public-mission institutions can always
control the veracity of the information recorded and does not arise sui generis rights on
orphan or public domain works.



D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 31 , and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database 32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition 33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub 34 is seeking to take such
identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated
licensing across different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
The European Union should ensure that: (1) identifiers as well as rights ownership and
permission databases should be based on open standards, available to all content
creators and able to be read by all market participants free of charge; and (2) all
identifiers as well as rights ownership and permission databases are interoperable
across all of Europe (and beyond).
Any system that is developed must be developed in a true multi stakeholder approach
(e.g not only by rights holders and intermediaries) and should be reflective of work
already undertaken (for example by Europeana). Rights ownership and permission
databases in particular must be publicly accessible via machine readable interfaces.
They must also include the ability to store information on out-of-copyright (Public
Domain) and openly licensed works.
It would be helpful if the EU could provide a database where any type of object could be
registered with any type of identifier. It would be difficult and pose major changes for
institutions to be obliged to employ only one type of identifier in the future as this would
be a major change to workflows and their standards which are often part of standards
documents and the outcome of long discussions among a large number of institutions.
The work of the institutions already registering the objects with unique identifiers could
be supported and used.


……………………………………………………………………………………………….

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention 35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
The term of copyright is too long. The firms who invested large sums of money into the
production of the resources have already generated what revenue they can generate
from the resource after very few years. After that the resources very often cannot be
sold for a profit anymore (except for a few very special objects) and it would be good to
just be able to release them to the public free of copyright or any other restrictions to
allow for a usage. But due to copyright they must be kept locked away from the public
for a large number of years. If organisations such as libraries want to offer these
resources which cannot be sold anymore online, they must invest enormous sums to
renegotiate rights for the online presentation of these resources with rightsholders,
which very often cannot be traced anymore.
Only a very small fraction of all works in copyright produce income over a long time
span. Thus the establishment of an automatic protection for a short period combined
with an option to extend this period via registration would free huge amounts of content.
Even with registration the term of copyright protections should be shortened
considerably.
The issue about shortening the term of protection of copyright for academic purposes is
particularly important as it impacts scientific enquiry and therefore should be
approached with strong evidences.
Knowledge-intensive economies are granted a clear advantage to support research and
bring innovation and economic growth. However, if a new model of copyright, flexible
enough to adapt to new technologies to come and new ways of re-using and building on
past knowledge, cannot be found, then Europe could lose its leadership position in this
area.
Time of protection should not be longer than 50 years after the death of the author. This
could be a first step towards a more significant reduction of term of protection that
would require a revision of the Berne convention.



 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC 36 .


36
  Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

                                                                                                           20
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law 37 . In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations
and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a
normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38 , these limitations and
exceptions are often optional 39 , in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B") 40 .
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

x YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
In principle, the research community strongly supports copyright harmonisation which
would imply making exceptions mandatory.
However, support for harmonisation very much depends on the conditions, namely what
exceptions would be added to, deleted from or narrowed or extended by that process.
Concrete examples for problems that may arise from optional adoption of limitations
are joint academic classes that are told at universities in two neighbouring countries – at
one university, teachers may be allowed to provide (more) copyright protected course
materials on the intranet, at the other university, regulations may differ. The same
situation could arise for cross-country research groups. Considering the enormous
interest in Massive Open Online Courses it can be expected that more and more
problems will arise if there is only a partial harmonization of limitations and exceptions.
Another example: Library in member state A. Provides resources to customer in
member state B. The fact that limitations and exceptions in directives are sometimes
optional leads to uncertainty for customers and providers of copyrightable information
such as libraries (texts, films, etc.) as to the extent the resources provided may be used
by the customers. The libraries are not able to answer the questions of the customers as
to whether an intended use of the resources is covered by limitations and exceptions
reliably. In consequence, libraries would have to license these rights from the
rightholders directly if they want to provide reliable services and avoid these legal
uncertainties.

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
All exceptions should be made mandatory for all EU countries, but in addition a more
flexible and open legislation is needed. In particular, a “fair use” exception would
ensure that the exceptions and limitations can keep pace with technology and social
changes. Another vitally important issue is that contracts shall not override limitations
and exceptions. Additionally, to address technological change that has already occurred,
the revised Directive should include an exception for text and data mining, as well as
mandatory research and education exceptions, plus Open Access legislation, and (unlike
the Orphan Works Directive) a functional exception for the mass digitisation and
making available of Out of Commerce Works by libraries, archives and museums for
non-commercial purposes.
Finally exceptions must be comprehensible for non-experts and should be bundled.

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
A fair use exception should be added to existing exceptions in order to ease
accommodation to changing or unforeseen users´ needs. The lack of this exception is
hampering the European researchers, who are unable to use technologies such as text
and data mining (TDM) on content whilst researchers in the US and Japan can lawfully
do so.
An exception for text and data mining.
A research-friendly copyright framework should not be perceived as a request for a
“free for all” environment. It is acknowledged that it is legitimate for copyright holders
to expect payment for providing access to information. However, current proposals to
levy additional licences to cover TDM activities on lawfully accessed information are not
seen as legitimate.


Researchers are also strongly interested in being able to use TDM technology on
lawfully accessed copyright protected content without the need of additional licenses by
the rights holders. A mandatory exception should be added to the European copyright
directive covering any form of content mining. Mining is not limited to certain types of
content This exception should cover necessary copies.
An exception for education, research and libraries should be made mandatory for all
Member States
Publishers should be obliged to deliver statutory copies of electronic publications free of
technical restrictions like Digital Right Management (DRM) in order to not hinder long-
term preservation, including format change and access according to copyright law




                                                                                        23
24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
X YES – Please explain why
All existing exceptions and limitations have to remain. We do NOT want to remove
already existing exceptions only add new ones and find a more flexible solution than the
current one. To list any new specific exceptions that will take into account any new
development in years to come wouldn’t prove to be useful. The current list should
therefore be combined with more general principles like “fair use” or “similar use”.

25.      If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives,
interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair
dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative
advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the
functioning of the Internal Market. Open question]
A fair-use provision would clearly enhance flexibility of the European copyright regime
and would help to accommodate “tailor-made” solutions where legislative changes
would not be justified or will probably not be provided within a desirable time frame.
This exception should be mandatory for all Member States in order to avoid distorting
effects on the internal market.



26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
X YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
Usage of many works being available online is not limited to one jurisdiction.
See also Qu. 21.
At present, the EU only obliges EU countries to adopt one exception (regarding
temporary acts of reproduction), while the adoption of the others is optional. As a result,
something that’s legal in one country could be illegal elsewhere.
For example, the UK is the only Member State without a private copying exception, so
an act that is legal in Spain or the Netherland suddenly becomes a criminal offence in
the UK. Finland hardly has a parody exception, so a work considered legal in Germany
could be infringing copyright in Finland.
From a research perspective, this means that researchers have difficulties working
together and sharing knowledge across borders. Currently, for example, inter-library
loans are hampered across borders.
Right owners and service providers based in jurisdictions with stricter user freedoms
often do not accept the wider scope of freedoms in other jurisdictions and attempt to
limit it contractually or use technical measures.

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
“Territoriality is not relevant for researchers”. They aim to reach the broadest possible
audience and rarely get remunerated for their publication. Therefore they would not
benefit from legislative changes enabling the content industry to gain additional
profits…………………………………………….
Fair compensation should be collected by national Rights Reproduction Organisations
(RRO) similar to the practice of VG Wort in Germany. Thereby there would be no need
to license individual works which is a major hindrance to give access for scientists to the
complete collections of scientific information of libraries. Especially those libraries with
a national role are affected which are financed to build up complete collections in order
to serve as a backbone to the national scientific information infrastructure and to
exchange information within the EU and beyond.



A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving 41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions 42 . The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive 43 .

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
(a)
Print and analogue materials. The digitization for preservation purposes carried out by
publicly accessible cultural institutions is implicitly included among the specific acts of
reproduction referred to in Article 5 (2) (c) of the Infosoc Directive. In addition, the EU
has repeatedly recommended the adoption of national policies encouraging the
digitization of cultural heritage. However, this exception is optional and it has been
generally implemented in very under narrow terms, so that, in many member states,
even format shifting for preservation purpose is still prohibited, or limited to specific
formats (in input and/or output) as show articles 68(2) and 69(2) of the Italian
Copyright law.

Digital materials fixed on support. CDs and DVDs are often protected by technological
measures (TPM). The removal of TPM would require the cooperation of the producer.
Art. 6 of the Infosoc Directive provides that technological protection measures are
protected per se, independently on the scope of protection, entrusting to voluntary
agreements or to subsidiary interventions of Member States the adoption of appropriate
measures to ensure that legitimate users can make effective use of licensed content. The
strength of the protection of TPMs compared with the weakness of the provision in
favor of legitimate uses has led in many Member States to the absence of effective
guarantee for legitimate users, including libraries. As a result, many libraries are not
able to reproduce CDs and DVDs legally acquired. These materials will become
unusable due to technological obsolescence in a few years.

Subscribed online content. In the case of online works there is no balance at all. All the
weight is on the side of the copyright holders only. Indeed the exception provided by
art. 5 (2) (c) of Directive 2001/29 does not apply because, according to art. 6 of the
Directive, it cannot be provided any obligation to the removal of TPM to the benefit of
beneficiaries of exceptions for "works or other subject-matter made available to the
public on agreed contractual terms in such a way that members of the public may access
them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them". While the exclusive
distribution right is exhausted by the first sale in EU, so that print materials can enter

                                                                                           26
permanently into the library collection, most content provided online are offered as
temporary services, ceasing upon the expiry of the subscription. In such cases, library
will have to pay again every year to ensure access to those content. In many cases, even
when licenses provide for a perpetual right of access in favor of the library and its users
((“post-termination clause”), libraries cannot obtain back-up files for conservation, but
can only have access through the producer's website, who does not give guarantees for
long-term preservation. Few licenses only, negotiated by libraries or their consortia,
provide for the delivery of files for local hosting and preservation purposes. Some others
contain a simple obligation to transfer the files in case the company will not be able to
host them.

Libraries play an important role in the network of cultural institutions in charge of
preserving nations’ history and archives. They play a specific role in the literature and
information sector by receiving in legal deposit, keeping and preserving, buying,
organizing, promoting and giving access to information books and literature as a whole.
Their mission is done on behalf of the general public, education and research. Several
issues are at stake now:- private companies that license content don’t have the mission
to defend or take into account the “public interest”, “education”, or “open access to
knowledge” in their business/licence models;
    ‐ Economic sustainability of private companies that license content doesn’t offer
       any long term guarantee;
    ‐ The evolution of format leads to a quick obsolescence that needs public
       infrastructure to act outside of economic interest to maintain national memories.
All these issues are implicit defined missions and policy goals for many libraries, both
public and academic

29.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
It is a fact that long-term strategies such as digital preservation and data curation are
at present largely entrusted to the market and its fluctuations which works quasi
exclusively on a very short-term .
Libraries should be granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual right to archive
complete copies of subscribed online materials, and to use the archived materials in the
event that access on the original platform is discontinued or suspended. An exception
should ensure, at the request of the library, the availability of back-up files for long-
term preservation, regardless of the format of publication. Digital legal deposit material
must be delivered without any DRM, in order to ensure back-up copies for preservation.
In any case, it shall be made mandatory that licences can't override exceptions and
limitations.

National information infrastructure providers of the country of utilization (i.e., the
country of the purchasing library) could be responsible for local hosting for
                                                                                        27
preservation purpose, as well as for permanent access to the licensed materials by
authorized users after the termination of a license contract, or in cases, when the
primary access provider (e.g. a publisher) is not able to do so.

Art. 5(2)(c) of the 2001/29/EC should be made mandatory. As the 'Study on the
application of directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in the information
society' (page 301) highlights, […]to make an exception mandatory could apply in the case
of article 5(2) c), as the development of digital libraries is one of the key objectives of the
Digital Agenda, and the digitization of cultural heritage is promoted by the Council and the
Commission […]. Art. 6 of the 2001/29/EC directive should be revised in order to
enforce exceptions and limitations and to ensure legitimate utilizations of protected
works, regardless of format or mode of dissemination.
Updating the copyright framework in order that online content is not considered a
service.
Under the current terms, the copyright framework considers online content as a (just
temporary) service. This creates a huge risk for cultural heritage institutions, much
higher than with print material, given the extreme volatility and perishability of digital
formats. It is a fact that long-term strategies such as digital preservation and data
curation are at present largely entrusted to the market and its fluctuations which works
quasi exclusively on a very short-term .
    ‐ Libraries should be granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual right to
        archive complete copies of subscribed online materials, and to use the archived
        materials in the event that access on the original platform is discontinued or
        suspended. An exception should ensure, at the request of the library, the
        availability of back-up files for long-term preservation, regardless of the format
        of publication.

That art. 5(2) c of Directive 2001/29/EC be made mandatory and art. 6 of Directive
2001/29/EC enforces exceptions and limitations and ensures legitimate utilizations of
protected works, regardless of format or mode of dissemination, would support the
specific public mission and responsibility of libraries and other cultural heritage
institutions that is different from most other users of copyrighted material.
Libraries’ responsibility is to preserve, organise, make available, and promote
information and literature, where most of the content is still copyright protected.
Short term economic interests shouldn’t limit long-term preservation of human’s
cultural heritage.
An updated copyright framework is needed to ensure specific regulation for libraries
and securing their public mission.
In the case some uses wouldn’t be covered by an exception, a “fair use” approach would
therefore be necessary.

See answer to question 30.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
As regards the exception, it should be stressed that access only via dedicated terminal
does not reflect and meet the reality of academic life in universities and research
institutions. Research and education is not restricted to the confines of the library, e.g. a
researcher working in the lab should be enabled to access content online from the lab.
Thus, it is necessary to widen this exception to accessing such content from the whole
research site / campus.

Remote access to online collection of libraries covers a broad spectrum going from
digitised collection to digital-born collection.




                                                                                           29
Currently there are gaps to be filled in the Directives (e.g. in Infosoc and Database
directives) and even more in national copyright laws. These gaps contribute to enforce
unbalanced power relations. Unbalanced power relations among right holders, and
between right holders and users do not contribute to establish an environment of best
practices for negotiation and contracts.
At present, licences are not satisfactory for the following reasons:

Technical accessibility and interoperability: Format shifting and other adaptations
should be permitted for long-term preservation purposes. It should be noted that TPMs
protect not only content, but also metadata related to those content, so that the legal
protection of TPMs affects also access and reuse of metadata for integration within
library catalogues and information discovery systems.

Inter-Library Loan and Document Supply: Cooperation between cultural institutions
for the benefit of the public is explicitly encouraged by numerous international, national
and regional standards. Interlibrary Loan should be made an obligatory exception or
limitation under Art. (5) (2).

Utilizations for distance learning courses and programmes: most publishers do not allow
the extraction and reuse of reasonable portions of protected works acquired or
subscribed by libraries or other cultural institutions and their communication to
registered users through e-Learning platforms. It is generally accepted that the
exception provided by Art. 5(3)(a) of Directive 2001/29/EC covers both face-to-face and
distance education, and that the fundamental rights it protects (freedom of expression,
right to be informed, right to learn) are of crucial importance. The enforcement of this
exception at European level, prohibiting its restriction by national legislations, or by
licences is of utmost importance.

Open access to research results: The Commission Recommendation of 17 July 2012 on
access to and preservation of scientific information, promotes the adoption by Member
States of policies that provide for the storage of the results of publicly funded research,
in online, open and free electronic infrastructures, which should be interoperable within
and outside the EU and suitable for long term preservation. Academic and research
libraries are directly involved in such activities: they are often responsible of their
parent institutional open access repositories. Other EU Recommendations require the
open access availability of articles and other publications which are the result of publicly
financed research, no later than six months after their publication. Some publishers
allow this practice to all their authors, others allow libraries to deposit just after long
negotiations, but the majority oppose clear refusal. There should be a legal instrument
enforcing – on one side - the right of authors in making their papers available to the
public for research and non-commercial purpose, and – on the other side - the right of
libraries or their parent institutions in collecting and making openly and publicly
available such content.
 Content mining: The potential of text and data mining for scientific research is huge,
and has been widely demonstrated. It is a process aimed to collect raw data (e.g., the
occurrence of words, figures etc. in a database), not creative expressions. Libraries are
interested in such utilization both for integrating content and metadata in their
catalogues and information systems, and for the benefit of their users. Undertaking text
and data mining of content to which researchers have already lawful access should be

                                                                                         30
considered a legitimate utilization, and should not be subject to re-license. But there is a
lack of legal certainty on this point, and most standard licences do not allow content
mining. As a consequence, in most cases researchers give up research, rather than
addressing high transaction cost, both direct (cost of re-licensing) and indirect (the time
needed to negotiate). For this, an exception should explicitly legitimate text and data
mining of content on which researchers have lawful access, for research and non-
commercial purpose.




33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
A copyright reform is needed in order to ease the public-interest mission of cultural
institutions.
Licences of digital content were expected to extend, not limit opportunities for access
and use through exceptions and limitations to exclusive rights. On the contrary,
exceptions and limitations are often overridden by licences and TPMs, even when
licences are negotiated by Library consortia.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
The reform should clarify that every kind of utilization made by libraries and cultural
institutions for their public-interest mission are allowed, no matter the medium of the
transmission.
Remote access should be allowed for all the utilizations discussed above (see answers to
Q 32).
Exceptions and limitations should apply to online content as well as to analogue
materials, and should be mandatory and cannot be overridden by contracts or TPMs.
Exceptions and limitations should be flexible and updated to new emerging needs,
introducing a general free use provision additional to the exceptions and limitations
expressly provided, as it has been suggested with art. 16 of the IFLA Treaty Proposal
(http://www.ifla.org/node/5858) and art. 5.5. of the European Copyright Code drafted
by the Wittem Group.
Such a general provision should allow application by analogy of existing exceptions and
limitations, provided they are consistent with the concept of ‘fair practice’, and/or
compliant with the Three-Step-Test, which presently is recalled by the Infosoc Directive
just to limit the application of Exceptions and Limitations.
Moreover, contracts should not override any statutory provisions regarding the entry of
a work into the public domain.

35.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]


                                                                                          31

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
YES – Please explain with specific examples
(a)
Significant barriers can be observed both for research and for public libraries: some
publishers refuse to supply their products to libraries, or offer them at higher prices
compared to their print equivalents, or impose default selection, such as bundling, or
remove content without informing the library and so on.
Moreover, multiple licences + different models create lack of clarity on the condition of
access to content for users.
Deterioration of authorised users’ rights is evident (e.g., crossing a border with a
borrowed book was not a problem. This is impossible with an online access to a library
across a border).
Usually licenses will not in any case allow e-lending to other libraries or patrons outside
of the library’s defined population (e. g. municipality, university, college).
If licences terms and conditions undermine the library’s missions, and the activities
established to fulfill it, then the introduction of and transition to e-material will result in
reduced availability for library patrons.

Quoting OECD (2012) *E-books: Developments and Policy Consideration*,
http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k912zxg5svh-en, p. 8: “[…] While e-books can help increase
access to information, DRM represents a significant obstacle to lending of e-books,and
challenges the exercise of such rights by libraries which could be considered a public
interest concern in the foreseeable future. The service must not be proprietary, and be
available for different technological platforms and devices.
The DRM generally embedded in many e-books being produced today does not allow for
the kind of free and open access provided by, for example, public libraries. However, most
e-editions in scholarly libraries are free of DRM.
                                                                                             32
[….] Because e-books are generally made available for lending only to registered users at a
particular library, libraries may need to purchase multiple licences rather than sharing
resources through interlibrary loans. Costs may also be affected if territorial Digital Rights
Management (DRM) restricts libraries to purchasing geographically-specific editions of
books […]”..



37.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
We would recommend to follow the EBLIDA principles on the acquisition and access to e-
books by libraries highlighting among others the following needs:
    ● All e-book titles available for sale to the public should be available to libraries for
        acquisition and access;
    ● All e-books titles should be available to libraries at the time of publication;
    ● Publishers should deliver e-books in interoperable formats, or cooperate with
        libraries in making interoperable formats;
    ● Libraries should be permitted to make available acquired or licensed e-books for
        a limited period of time to a user.
    ● It should be possible to use the same e-book title simultaneously;
    ● Authorised users should be able to download an e-book either in the library or by
        way of remote access via authentication systems.
see:          http://www.eblida.org/Special%20Events/Key-principles-acquistion-eBooks-
November2012/GB_English%20Version%20Key%20Principles.pdf
NB: as mentioned in the principles, a registered user is a user who has registered with
the library and whose identity is known to the library.
Public lending right (PLR) and e-lending
An adaptation of the PLR under the form of a Legal Licence (including exception
whenever necessary) could be a path to follow to ensure a fair remuneration to authors.
See the definition on the SOFIA website: “The legal licence regime, as in the French
system, is an alternative allowed for under article 5 of Directive 92/100. Under this
provision, the State may waive the exclusive right provided for public lending, provided
at least the authors obtain remuneration in respect of this lending, with each nation
retaining the ability to set this remuneration, taking due account of its cultural
promotion targets. This text also enables the State to exempt certain categories of
library from payment of the remuneration”.( http://tinyurl.com/k276kto).
The legal licence doesn’t have to impact the selling price of the online content, but it
shall override any other remuneration claims for library lending. The role of libraries in
delivering free promotion of publishers and authors in their mission should be clearly
acknowledged. This role is indeed supported by some authors such as Fiktion.cc
(http://fiktion.cc/about.php)

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
                                                                                             33
[Open question]
There is no possible comparison between physical and online collection in libraries.
Theoretically digital collection should be based on the economy of abundance meaning
access to an infinity of content, where budget constraint could be the “only” limit. And
should therefore offer a wider access to content.
But in reality, libraries can buy all physical publications, when they cannot buy licences
to all commercially available content because “the rights holders are free to decide
whether they want to give access to a specific work, and to decide on the terms for such
access. The consequence of this is that the collection building policy may be decided by the
publisher and not by the library “ (see EBLIDA. European Libraries and the challenges
of e-publishing. May 2012, http://www.eblida.org/news/european-libraries-and-the-
challenges-of-e-publishing.html).
In addition to this core issue, publishers currently develop models with a lot of frictions
that are either mere copy/paste of physical models or unaffordable models at high
costs, or annual subscription packages where the libraries have no influence on the
selection of publications.. None of the models pay attention to libraries public missions
and needs.
Libraries should have a “right to e-lend”, which will give the library users a “right to e-
read”.
The format and technology must not be an hindrance for access to books.
Legal mechanisms and terms should be equivalent for analog and digital lending.


39.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

Libraries with a national role like the German National Library of Science and
Technology (TIB), primarily have to offer their services off-premises and customers
request digital information. Its services require functioning exceptions or limitations for
the digital world, since licences do not offer the same reliability. TIB serves universities
and research institutions as well as industrial companies in Germany and abroad,
primarily in Europe.

4.     Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries

                                                                                                34
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other 44 . Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted) 45 .

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
The term Mass digitisation (as referred to in the Orphan Works Directive) applies to
publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums, as well as by
archives, film or audio heritage institutions and public-service broadcasting
organisations. The orphan works directive contains a restrictive clause on diligent
search that makes it impractical to use. The MoU on Out of Commerce Works might
have solved the Orphan Works directive issue by addressing the issue from a broader
perspective. In addition to the fact that national laws fail to fully address the needs of
digital libraries, the MoU is severely limited by its lack of concrete application across
Europe and the lack of implementation in National Law. It is most probable that the
question of cross-border access will be better solved by enabling an exception for
publicly funded institution for making available content resulting of Mass digitisation
process by an extension of articles 5 (2)c and 5(3)n of the Infosoc directive.
Solutions exist, such as Extended Collective Licensing that might be useful when it
comes to make available content online for projects resulting from Mass digitization, as
stated in the report available at :
http://www.ivir.nl/publicaties/guibault/ECL_Europeana_final_report092011.pdf
41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
YES – Please explain
The mechanism should be based on an exception allowing for mass digitization of out of
print works. The mechanism should regulate right clearance in line with the guidelines
provided for in the Out of Commerce MoU guidelines.



44
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
45
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             35
B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC 46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
x YES – Please explain
The German regulation (§ 52a UrhG) is very complicated and may turn out to be
unusable due to recent case law mandating individual registration of every copy made
based on this exception.
Please also refer to the response in question 21.

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
It would be easier for libraries to handle if limitations and exceptions for educational
and scientific purposes were the same at least within Europe.
Exceptions for education and research need to be broad enough to correspond to
current habits of students, teachers and researchers, e.g. they should accommodate new
forms of teaching like MOOCs. Any regulation based on the notion that teaching only
takes place with fixed groups of students in classrooms and learning takes place within
an adjunct library are outdated.
Most licences do not allow the extraction and reuse of reasonable portions of licensed
materials and their communication to Authorized Users through e-Learning platforms.
It is generally accepted that the exception provided by Art. 5(3)(a) of Directive
2001/29/EC covers both face-to-face and distance education, and that the fundamental
rights it protects (freedom of expression, right to be informed) are of crucial importance,
it is of particular importance the enforcement of this exception at European level,
prohibiting its restriction by national legislations, or by licences.


Licenses for electronic journals are usually very restrictive when it comes to serving
users outside of the institution, even electronic transmission of single articles in pdf-

46
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                               36
format to external individual users or other libraries. It can however be printed and sent
by regular mail, which seems rather odd these days. University and college libraries
usually manage the licenses as a continuation of their earlier mission of providing
necessary literature and information for students and teachers.
The rule stating that licenses override copyright must be changed and turned the other
way around, so that exceptions override the license terms if the licenses do not comply
with exceptions in the copyright law.



44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]


Teaching faculty have to contact the publisher directly. Some publishers provide such
information in a manner which can easily be understood by the users, but some
publishers do not provide this information or provide it in a manner which cannot be
understood. This is a burdensome and ineffective process hindering academic teaching
in Europe. An obligatory exeception or limitation would serve better.




45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
[Open question]
The mandatory educational exception should cover all uses of all types of works for
illustration of teaching. It shall not be limited to any types of institution but rather
defined by its purpose: teaching.

46.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
There shouldn’t be any different solution.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC 47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain
Access to scientific articles and books in electronic format is mostly provided based on
subscription contracts limiting the use to members of the subscribing institution and to
the computer network of that institution. This access regime is not consistent with the
way research projects are carried out, as they typically involve cooperation between
researchers from several institutions, often from different countries. The subscription
contracts as well as legal differences in the countries of residence of the cooperating
researchers raise unnecessary barriers. Due to the complexity, pending litigations and
due to its possible termination by the end of 2014, many researchers in German do not
dare using § 52a UrhG for research purposes, a copyright exception for education and
research..




48.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Germany does have a copyright exception for education and research. However this
exception is construed too narrow. Several announcements by the German Government
have so far not resulted in an amendment that would solve the issues raised by the
education, research and libraries communities (see statements by the German Alliance
of Research Organisations). Recent court decisions have further limited the practical use
of the exception.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
Find below positions on Open access and content mining as highlighted in Question 32:
Open access to research results: The Commission Recommendation of 17 July 2012 on
access to and preservation of scientific information, promotes the adoption by Member
States of policies that provide for the storage of the results of publicly funded research,
in online, open and free electronic infrastructures, which should be interoperable within
and outside the EU and suitable for long term preservation. Academic and research
libraries are directly involved in such activities: they are often responsible of their
parent institutional open access repositories. Other EU Recommendations require the
open access availability of articles and other publications which are the result of publicly
financed research, no later than six months after their publication. Some publishers
allow this practice to all their authors, others allow libraries to deposit just after long
negotiations, but the majority oppose clear refusal. There should be a legal instrument


                                                                                          38
enforcing – on one side - the right of authors in making their papers available to the
public for research and non-commercial purpose, and – on the other side - the right of
libraries or their parent institutions in collecting and making openly and publicly
available                                 such                                content

Content mining: The potential of text and data mining for scientific research is
enormous, and has been widely demonstrated. It is a process aimed to collect raw data
(e.g., the occurrence of words, figures etc. in a database), not creative expressions.
Libraries are interested in such utilization both for integrating content and metadata in
their catalogues and information systems, and for the benefit of their users. Undertaking
text and data mining of content to which researchers have already lawful access should
be considered a legitimate utilization, and should not be subject to re-license. But there
is not legal certainty on this point, and most standard licences do not allow content
mining. As a consequence, in most cases researchers give up research, rather than
addressing high transaction cost, both direct (cost of re-licensing) and indirect (the time
needed to negotiate). For this, an exception should explicitly legitimate text and data
mining on content on which researchers have lawful access, for research and non-
commercial purpose.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC 48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49 .

The Marrakesh Treaty 50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main

51
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              40
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe” 52 . In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
     YES – Please explain
In many cases TDM is made difficult or impossible due to copyright/contractual
agreement issues. This compromises the quality of the research results which could have
been achieved using these technologies Commonly researchers intend to use content
from a great number of different sources for TDM which considerably complicates the
implementation of any regulations which would require licensing. This has shown that it
would greatly slow down the research process too, which could have significant
consequences, for example in the case of medical research.
Researchers report that some TDM licensing terms in subscription contracts rule out
the combination of several data sources.
TDM is exploratory work. Results cannot be predicted. Quick tries including changes in
the sources are part of this exploratory word. Such dynamic in combination with
uncertainties concerning the outcome of the work are strong arguments against
licensing
TDM should be understood as an extension of reading. Research libraries which provide
access to reading to their users should be allowed to provide TDM services without any
additional licences.



The potential of text and data mining for scientific research is enormous, and has been
widely demonstrated (1 See JISC (2012), The value and benefits of text mining,

mining.pdf), see alro key resources below. It is a process aimed to collect raw data (e.g.,
the occurrence of words, figures etc. in a database), not creative expressions.
Undertaking text and data mining of content to which researchers have already lawful
access should be considered a legitimate utilization, and should not be subject to re-
license. But there is not legal certainty on this point, and most standard licences do not
allow content mining. As a consequence, in most cases researchers give up research,
rather than addressing high transaction cost, both direct (cost of re-licensing) and
indirect (the time needed to negotiate). For this, an exception should explicitly legitimate
text and data mining on content on which researchers have lawful access, for research
and non-commercial purpose.
Since in most cases it is necessary to make a copy of the content in order for a machine
to extract facts and data for mining, the act of text and data mining is precluded under
copyright law in Europe. Because it prevents the copying of large portions of databases,
the Database Directive is also a legal barrier to text and data mining. Technical
protection measures (also protected under law), preventing the downloading of large
amounts of content, are also preventing the application of text and data mining
techniques. Although text and data mining is concerned with the extraction of facts and
data, the results of text and data mining research are currently being suppressed
because of a lack of legal clarity.
Even if content is openly available on the Web, without explicit permission indicating
otherwise, it is unclear if the copying of this content for the purpose of text and data
mining is legal. Content licensed under open access licences such as cc-by-sa or cc-by-nc
may be inadvertently preventing users from mining the content.

54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
For this, an exception should explicitly legitimate text and data mining on content on
which researchers have lawful access, for research and non-commercial purpose
Researchers must be able to share the results of text and data mining, as long as these
results are not substitutable for the original copyright work - irrespective of copyright
law, database law or contractual terms to the contrary. A specific exception to this effect
allowing the copying of content for the purpose of text and data mining is necessary.
Such an exception should not distinguish between commercial and non-commercial
purposes as, for research institutions, this would prevent knowledge transfer.
•      An exception for text and data mining would provide legal certainty;
•      TPMs and contracts should not override such an exception;
•      Differentiating between commercial and non-commercial activity is not in the
public interest.
Also for institutions such as libraries a legal exception for the use of licensed material
for text- and data mining and other methods to provide better search tools or results
would be very helpful. New search technologies developed and employed by libraries
tend to meshing/interfering more and more with the actual content and the structure
and design of the content as designed by the creator. These new methods and
technologies sometimes cross the border between copyright free use and a use for which
permission of the copyright owner is needed, even though the only goal is to provide
better search tools and services for users without changing the licensed content itself
(please see question 53). This should be in the best interests of the rightsholders, because
these technologies are directed at providing better and easier access to the works.
This limitation should not only be limited to text, but be valid for all other kinds of
materials as for example also for films, music, research data, 3D-Objects, etc.


55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
A right to copy and adapt copyrightable electronic works for the purposes of providing
better search tools and services for users interested in finding the objects offered by for
example libraries (or other institutions offering similar services).
A legislative solution should take the form of an exception which allows the copying of
content and the circumvention of TPMs for text and data mining purposes. This
exception must not be over-ridable by contracts.

56.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Licensing will not work as an alternative solution. The negotiation of licences is resource
intensive and unscalable. Nor will licences addresses the current ambiguity around the
mining of the open Web.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
[Open question]
For data in databases not owned by libraries or universities a license agreement is
needed . In that situation, TDM becomes a property right and a security issue.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs 53 . User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated


53
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

     IV.       Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying 55 . Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
55
     Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                              46
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees 56 57 .
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions 58 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies? 59
NO. When content has been already licensed, users should not be subject to payment for
uses that are compliant with the licence’s terms.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

  V.      Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from



                                                                                           48
authors or performers to producers 61 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 62 . This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
Of course there is the need to provide mechanisms so that creators receive adequate
remuneration for their works if they want.
On the other hand there is also the need to allow creators to waive the right for adequate
remuneration if they decide for themselves that they want to publish their works under
Open Access Licenses (such as the licenses of Creative Commons) to allow for a swift
and easy distribution of their works. In these cases the authors/creators have decided
that a swift and easy distribution through the internet is preferable to common methods
of distribution via off-line-publishing and mostly do not expect any payment for their
works.


……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
     YES – Please explain
Limitations and exceptions should always have priority. Contract regulations should not
be allowed to annul the copyright exceptions.
An unalienable right for self-archiving (unabdingbares Zweitveröffentlichungsrecht) at
EU level could be a solution.
There is a need for the EU to oblige the member states to provide a mandatory exception
from the right to remuneration if the authors/creators/performers offer their works
under Open Access Licenses designed to allow the use of the work by anyone.
     NO – Please explain why

     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE 63 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text 64 . Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose 65 . One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure 66 . At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

The next (urgent) step should be the enlargement and enforcement of exceptions and
limitations, but such process could led to a broader copyright reform.
The current level of differences among Member State Legislation can be compared to
the current differences among Member State social system, or standard of living that
cannot be fixed by a regulation. Sorting out the current impediments due to the
inadequacy of the system means to rethink the framework on long-term while acting
now to enact progressive solutions.

VIII.     Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]

Copyright law reform at the European level is absolutely necessary to simplify the current
complicated regime and the overlapping of different directives. Licensing initiatives alone
will not achieve this.

Meanwhile, the EU should develop mechanisms to ensure that licence clauses cannot
override existing exceptions and limitations. During the previous Licences for Europe
dialogue, it has never been made possible to discuss this issue, hence the need of urgent
decision on that point. For the same reason, the removal of technological protection
measures should be made compulsory for all legitimate uses.
Compulsory Licenses for Libraries
The exclusive rights that exist in regards to published works should not include the right
of refusal to sell to libraries, or to limit their services, both in physical and digital
environment.
Commercial licences for libraries should include the utilizations presently permitted by
Infosoc and Database Directives.
In all cases, the use of the acquired materials should be allowed for the following
purposes:

   a. Research. The Library, its parent Institution’s staff and affiliates together with
      its Authorized Users should, from a place and at a time individually chosen by
      them, be able to search, retrieve, and display the licensed materials, print or
      download and save individual chapters, articles or items of the licensed materials
      without legal or technological impediment. Moreover, they should be able to use
      data and text mining technologies to derive information from the licensed
      materials for computational analysis and other research purposes.
   b. Education and Teaching. The Library and its Authorized Users should be able to
      extract or use information contained in licensed materials for educational,

                                                                                          52
     information or images for the purpose of illustration, explanation, comment,
     criticism, teaching, research, or analysis. The Library and/or its parent
     Institution’s staff and affiliates should be able to use a reasonable portion of
     licensed materials in the course of instruction and communicate same material to
     Authorized Users at a place and time convenient to them.
c.   Scholarly Sharing. Authorized Users should be able to transmit to a third party
     colleague in hard copy or electronically, insubstantial amounts of the licensed
     materials for personal, scholarly, educational, scientific, or research uses.
     Authorized Users should be able to use, with appropriate credit, figures, tables
     and brief excerpts from the Licensed Materials in the Authorized User’s own
     scientific, scholarly and educational works. When an Authorized User is the
     Author of an article which is part of the licensed materials, and which is the
     result of a publicly funded research, he/she or the Library staff should be able to
     put such work, with appropriate credit to the Publisher, in an Open Access
     repository after a reasonable time from the date of its publication.
d.   Interlibrary Loan. Licensee’s staff should be able to provide to other libraries or
     cultural institutions whether by post or fax, or secure electronic transmission,
     whereby the electronic file is deleted immediately after printing, for the purposes
     of research or private study and not for Commercial Use, a single copy of
     articles, chapters, or other individual documents from licensed materials.
e.   Technical Accessibility, usability and interoperability. Format shifting and other
     adaptations should be permitted for long-term preservation purposes, or to
     ensure technical accessibility and usability by visually impaired Authorized
     users, or to effectively integrate Licensed Materials in Library information
     systems, according to international standards of interoperability. Within the
     limits of these purposes, the Licensor should agree to temporarily remove the
     technical barriers that may prevent adaptations.
f.   Administrative and Judicial Proceedings. The Library, its parent Institution’s
     staff, affiliates and authorized users should be able to transmit and/or upload
     individual articles to secure electronic systems for judicial and administrative
     use, including any national research quality assessment and the selection
     procedures for academic and professional careers.
g.   Archival Availability. The Library should be granted a nonexclusive, royalty-
