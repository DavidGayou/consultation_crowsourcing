a)       Rights and functioning of the Single Market

                A strong copyright framework is the foundation not just of the European television
                industry (an €84.4bn sector) but also of the wider creative content industries.
                Copyright-intensive industries account for 4.2% of EU GDP and 3.2% of EU jobs, and
                play a crucial role investing in local content and talent, promoting cultural and linguistic
                diversity and encouraging media literacy across the EU.

                Free-to-air commercial broadcasters offer high-quality audiovisual content to
                consumers for free. This is made possible by their advertising-based business model,
                which is necessarily national in scope and which differentiates them from pay TV
                operators and public broadcasters. A strong copyright framework enables content
                tailored to local tastes, delivered by many means of distribution and with a wide range
                of offers (e.g. terrestrial, cable, satellite, IPTV, OTT; advertising-based, pay TV, TVoD,
                SVoD).

      Cross border access to audiovisual content online is not hampered by the current
      copyright framework. This is evidenced by the wealth of online offerings increasingly
      made available to consumers, often without geo-blocking. There are now over 3,000
      on-demand audiovisual services available in Europe.

      The market should be allowed to work on the basis of contractual freedom, sustainable
      business practices and fair competition. In today’s multi-platform, multi-window world,
      territorial distribution is frequently the optimum way of recouping the big investment
      needed for audiovisual content creation, production and distribution.

      There is no uncertainty, from a practical point of view, regarding the scope of the
      making available right: content is made available in the Member States where it can be
      accessed. RTL Group does not support proposals such as the introduction of extended
      collective licensing schemes, new forms of mandatory collective licensing or the
      general extension of the country-of-origin principle to linear and non-linear online
      distribution.

      RTL Group believes that “deep” links and embedding/framing leading directly to the
      execution/viewing of content may trigger the communication to the public right, subject
      to a case-by-case assessment. In line with the recent Svensson judgment by the Court
      of Justice of the European Union, this should not be the case when hyperlinks are
      simply a reference to a source where it may be possible to access content (and
      assuming a “new” public is not reached).

      The principle of exhaustion was conceived for physical goods and should not apply to
      the digital world. Such a solution would significantly damage the audiovisual industries
      by jeopardising the commercial exploitation of works online (e.g. by destroying the
      primary market).


b) Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

      In the event of a targeted review of limitations and exceptions, RTL Group would
      support the adoption of a mandatory list across the whole EU. However, this would
      have to be done extremely carefully to make sure that exceptions and limitations are
      not abused for commercial purposes (e.g. by service providers using broadcasters’
      content/signal without seeking their authorisation).

      Fair-use provisions do not lead to greater clarity: the US experience and years of case
      law have demonstrated this. They are also not transposable to the EU copyright
      acquis, and would cause added uncertainty and litigation when applied by the courts of
      28 different Member States.




                                                                                            2
c)   Private copying and reprography

       Increasingly new players offer commercial services to consumers by abusing the
       notion of a private copy exception, using professional TV content without negotiating
       with broadcasters. This situation needs to be addressed, as these services do not
       negotiate licences or refinance investments in content, yet generate their own
       revenues on the basis of right holders’ content.

       Commercial broadcasters must benefit from private copy remuneration on fair and
       equitable terms together with other categories of right holders. Considering recent case
       law of the CJEU and the fact that their content is one of the most widely copied
       worldwide, it is essential that they be compensated fairly in Member States that have
       introduced a private copy exception.

d) Fair remuneration of authors and performers

       Introducing new unwaivable rights for authors and performers would lead to increasing
       dispersion/fragmentation of rights, prevent their centralisation in the producer and
       make licensing slower and more difficult. This would ultimately hamper the accessibility
       of content to consumers. RTL Group does not see the need to address this at EU level.


e)   Respect for rights

       Broadcasters face a particular set of challenges with regard to IP enforcement in the
       online environment, in particular piracy of their live signal and the breach of their
       retransmission right. This poses significant difficulties from a (cross-border) civil
       enforcement point-of-view. Model rules at EU level for fast-track proceedings for civil
       law cases concerning infringements of IPR would be helpful.

       RTL Group encourages the European Commission to promote the cooperation of
       intermediaries in combating IP infringements (e.g. Internet service providers, search
       engines, hosting service providers, payment intermediaries and advertising services).
       In parallel, strong IP enforcement frameworks both within and outside the EU are
       essential to ensure a high level of protection for audiovisual creators (e.g. WIPO).

     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.

    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
     NO OPINION
- The market is naturally moving towards addressing demand for cross-border delivery of
content where it is economically significant. This depends on a number of factors which will
be analysed in the following questions.
- Free-to-air commercial broadcasters offer high-quality audiovisual content to consumers for
free, including through their online catch-up platforms. A strong copyright framework enables
content tailored to local tastes, delivered by many means of distribution and with a wide range
of offers (e.g. terrestrial, cable, satellite, IPTV, OTT; advertising-based, pay TV, TVoD,
SVoD).
- This is illustrated by the increase in linear TV consumption over the last ten years (with EU
citizens spending an average 237 minutes per day watching TV in 2012), as well as the large
consumer take-up of broadcasters’ online platforms.
- It is important to highlight the differences between free-to-air commercial broadcasters,
public broadcasters and pay TV operators. While the former offer content to the consumer for
free and recoup their investments through advertising (which is necessarily national in scope),
public broadcasters are funded primarily by the state.
- Pay TV broadcasters, on the other hand, generally rely on a monthly subscription fee
charged to consumers and are therefore arguably less reliant on territorial exclusivity to be
able to sustain their business. For example, a satellite feed can reach consumers equipped with
the necessary decryption card across multiple Member States.
- This has important implications for the debate on copyright, since these differences have an
impact on consumer expectations, particularly in the online environment. They may also lead
to the erroneous grouping of all broadcasters under a single category, when in fact they
represent different offers to consumers based on different business models. They will also be
impacted differently by changes to EU copyright rules. Care should be taken to ensure that
free-to-air commercial broadcasters are allowed to continue delivering high-quality content to
consumers for free.

2.     [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
      NO
- Cross border access to audiovisual content online is not hampered by the current copyright
framework. There are no legal or technical obstacles to do this. If a service provider wishes to
make audiovisual content available on a multi-territory basis, it is a question of weighing the
consumer demand for such a service against the cost of implementing it and acquiring the
necessary rights from the relevant right holder(s).
- This assessment of economic feasibility involves an evaluation of (i) consumer demand in
the target markets; (ii) language and cultural specificity; and (iii) the cost of marketing a
service in foreign territories; (iv) providing adequate quality of service and customer support;
(v) operating costs, storage and bandwidth, etc (see Figure 1. below). Different consumer
protection rules across the EU also need to be assessed.

                                  Figure 1: Breakdown of fixed and variable costs by type for a
                                 pan-European VoD Service (excluding rights acquisition costs)

                                growth, eMedia Institute, March 2012



- As a general rule, when RTL Group profit centres hold all the necessary rights, audiovisual
content is made available online without restrictions based on location.
            • As an example, approximately 70% of RTL Television’s (Germany) VoD inventory, including own-
produced content (i.e. for which RTL owns all the rights), is accessible worldwide. Licensed content making up
the remaining 30% (e.g. from the major US studios, format licences, sports) is usually made available in
Germany, Austria and Switzerland. For this content there is not enough demand for RTL Television to license
outside these territories (i.e. by paying an additional fee which licensors demand). Very few series/shows are
restricted to Germany-only (less than 10 of approx. 800 different long-form titles).
           • A similar situation is found for the online platforms of most RTL Group profit centres, where own
content is generally made available without restrictions while premium US movies/series are not. As additional
examples, content for which M6 (France) owns all the rights is accessible worldwide in its 6play VoD platform,
while RTL-TVI (Belgium) has a total of 119,041 videos on its online VoD platforms16, of which 90.5% are
available cross-border.


16
     At the time of writing (January 2014).

                                                                                                            8

           • RTL Group data regarding usage of our online platforms confirms that traffic from outside the
relevant language zones is very limited and irrelevant from a consumer demand / advertising point of view. For
example, 90% of online traffic to Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland’s online platforms comes from users located
within Germany. This is an important point when considering the issue of territoriality in Question 7, as well as
evaluating consumer demand and the need of commercial free-to-air broadcasters to recoup investments.



   Conclusion: Cross-border access to audiovisual content online is not hampered by the
current copyright framework. Making audiovisual content available on a multi-territory basis
is a question of weighing the consumer demand for such a service against the cost of
implementing it. The market is naturally moving towards addressing demand for cross-
border delivery of content where it is economically significant.



3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
- As a producer of audiovisual content, RTL Group (through FremantleMedia [FMM] / UFA)
does grant multi-territorial licences, for example licences for “Europe” or for “World”. These
multi-territorial licences are granted to between ten and twenty different broadcasters and
service providers (for different programmes), and make up approximately 25% of all licence
requests to FMM.
- It is important to have the contractual freedom to determine the geographical reach of
licences, as they will be tailored to reflect the technological reach, customers and outputs of
the content providers themselves. This in turn allows for successful monetisation of the
content, re-investment in new programming and the sustaining of thousands of jobs in the
creative industries.
- The market is also reflecting new technological developments. For example, FMM has
recently signed a multi-territory deal with Netflix, which covers the Netherlands and the UK.
This covers all types of content for Internet streaming on a subscription basis. In addition, the
company also has a deal with iTunes covering Germany, France and the UK.
- As explained in the previous answer, licensing of audiovisual works in the EU is a matter of
individual negotiation between producers and audiovisual media service providers. Producers
own or represent all of the right holders’ rights and are therefore capable of delivering mono-
territory and multi-territory licenses for audiovisual works.


   Conclusion: Requests for multi-territorial licences to producers may be significant, but
having the contractual freedom to determine their geographical scope is crucial to both right
holders and content providers, as it allows for the successful monetisation of audiovisual
content, the recouping of investments and the sustaining of thousands of jobs in the creative
industries.

4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
- The fact that it is not always possible to access online VoD services in EU Member States
other than the one in which consumers reside can be addressed without jeopardising the
ability of right holders to re-invest continuously in European content.
- For example, it may be possible to address this issue by promoting the ability of EU citizens
to access content and services from their home territory while travelling in other EU
countries.
- Solutions such as this were discussed during the Licences for Europe stakeholder dialogue,
and different models are currently being trialled by broadcasters (e.g. one-day subscription to
sports content, allowing a consumer to watch a live football game while abroad).

   Conclusion: Given the current speed of technology and the constant launch of new offers
to consumers, a market-led approach is most appropriate to address issues where they exist.



5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
- If a producer has the ambition to export a certain format or programme abroad, that may
represent a valid business reason to impose territorial restrictions despite holding all the
rights, given that its value will decrease in case viewers in the target country have already
viewed the content online. RTL Group examples include X Factor and Got Talent, where it is
vital to the business that territorial exclusivity can be granted to the local licensee (e.g.
producer or broadcaster).
- In addition, right holders may also want to retain rights in order to sublicense their
content/formats to third parties who are more effective at distributing and monetising them in
their own territories (e.g. due to better knowledge of local consumer preferences, culture,
etc.). This can lead to a more successful commercial exploitation than (right holder-operated)
direct-to-consumer offers.
- It should be noted that the EU is a world leader in the export of programme formats. RTL
Group believes that it would be a strategic mistake on the European Commission’s part to
undermine a business sector where EU companies are global leaders and innovators.

    Conclusion: The imposition of territorial restrictions by a right holder on a service
provider may be needed for different reasons linked to the need to ensure the successful
commercial exploitation of the audiovisual work (e.g. export of formats/programmes to
foreign markets; sublicensing; etc.) [Note: see also question 7.]




                                                                                            10

6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
- Advertising markets are national, which means that for a commercial free-to-air broadcaster
to make content available across borders there needs to be a prior assessment of whether this
is viable from both an economic and technical standpoint (i.e. if it is possible to generate
advertising revenues in the target market).
- This will depend on the distribution platform (e.g. cable, online, etc.) and the costs
associated with acquiring the necessary licences when the rights do not belong to the
broadcaster. For example, for the linear broadcast of Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland
advertising windows are in place for Germany/Austria/Switzerland, allowing the company to
take advantage of the same-language zone to tap into local advertising markets.
- The same reasoning applies to online platforms: redirection to a different website may be a
way to ensure that the content presented to the consumer is tailored to his
language/culture/country and also to allow for monetisation of the platform. As an example,
when a user from France accesses thematic websites for programmes broadcast by RTL-TVI
in Belgium, he/she is re-directed towards the relevant M6-operated website in France (which
features targeted advertising that is relevant to that consumer).
- Other reasons for imposing territorial restrictions include: the financial burden if RTL Group
channels needed to hire multi-lingual staff for our customer services to provide support to
viewers from other territories; use of expensive content delivery networks (CDNs) needed for
delivering audiovisual content in high-quality; VAT and accounting difficulties associated
with handling transactions in different Member States.

    Conclusion: Territorial restrictions and/or redirection to a different website may be
needed in order to ensure that online platforms can be monetised successfully (e.g. by
targeting local advertising that is relevant to a consumer from a certain territory). Multi-
territory exploitation also involves costs other that rights acquisition/clearance, such as
ensuring adequate consumer support and quality of service.




7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  NO – Please explain

- Exclusive territorial distribution benefits the whole creative value chain and ensures
sustainable investment in the creation, production and distribution of content. The main
obstacles that impede the development of cross-border offers for audiovisual content are not
copyright-related but rather the result of the cultural and linguistic diversity of the European

                                                                                             11

Union. Legal intervention in this regard is not warranted, as the market is working and
responding to consumer demand17.
- This is evidenced by the wealth of online offerings increasingly made available to
consumers by broadcasters and other players, often without geo-blocking. There are now over
3000 on-demand audiovisual services available in Europe, compared to less than 700 at the
end of 2008. The market should be allowed to work on the basis of contractual freedom,
sustainable business practices and fair competition.
- Providing cross-border online services for audiovisual content involves significant
challenges that are unrelated to the copyright framework. In particular, demand for
audiovisual content across borders is limited, highly dependent on language and significant
only for certain types of premium content (e.g. US movies and series) and certain target
groups.
- The March 2012 Plum study on the economic potential of cross-border pay-to-view and
listen audiovisual media services estimates the total demand for transfrontier audiovisual
services at €760m annually (0.7% of the EU television market). However, demand is uneven
across the 702 markets analysed: in over 200 such markets, the value is below €10,000 p.a. In
others, where the demand is commercially interesting (e.g. Romanian language services in
Spain or Italy) commercial broadcasters often already provide services.

On the issue of territoriality:
- Territoriality was discussed during 2013 in the Licences for Europe stakeholder dialogue.
Through the Association of Commercial Television in Europe (ACT), RTL Group and other
commercial broadcasters made the following key points:
         (i) Broadcasters are one part of a complex series of value chains, each stage of which
has its own business rationale and investment decisions to underpin strategies on distribution.
         (ii) In today’s multi-platform, multi-window world, territorial distribution is
frequently the optimum way, via exclusivity and price differentiation, of maximising
revenues.
        (iii) This revenue then flows back into new investment in content. According to a
recent European Commission study, approximately 44% of total European broadcasting
revenues are reinvested into content18. For the main commercial broadcasting groups this
investment amounts to over €15 billion a year (or €41 million a day).
          (iv) Not only do national language, tastes and interests vary, but programme genres
are key factors in determining value across markets. Sport – which viewers wish to watch live
– raises different issues from a drama series or classic movie.
         (v) Even within genres, different commercial factors will inform the distribution
strategies of niche sports (e.g. ice-hockey) from those with global appeal. Distribution
strategy will often be decided on a programme-by-programme basis. Initiatives such as
‘download and play’ or one-day subscription packages for sports channels are being trialled.

17
   It should be noted that problems exist in relation to the clearance of music rights incorporated in audiovisual
content (e.g. clearance of performing rights for online uses). The proposed directive on collective rights
management and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online uses aims to address (at least in
part) this issue.

         (vi) An EU audiovisual market without territorial exclusivity would also have an
adverse impact on non-economic goals of media regulation such as cultural and linguistic
diversity.

                            Have access to content in their language that fits their interests, at a price they can
              Consumers
                            afford. New offers are being brought to market on a regular basis.

      Content Producer/     Gives them the option to generate maximum return on their investment by
                            segmenting rights between one or a series of broadcasters or choosing to retain
            Right holders   rights to exploit themselves.

                            The majority of platform operators focus on one country or territory because it
                            allows them to develop and exploit specialist market knowledge and deliver
             Distributors
                            brands, infrastructure, marketing and customer support that best serves

                            through a local distributor who has the market knowledge and expertise to deliver

                            Advertising is the biggest revenue stream for European television and is highly
              Advertisers   national (as products are different). Channels that are not targeted at national
                            markets are of very little value to advertisers.


   Conclusion: exclusive territorial distribution benefits the whole creative value chain and
ensures sustainable investment in the creation, production and distribution of content. The
main obstacles that impede the development of cross-border online offers for audiovisual
content are not copyright-related but rather the result of the cultural and linguistic diversity of
the European Union. Legal intervention in this regard is not warranted, as the market is
working and responding to consumer demand.




B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC19 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software20 and databases21.


19
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
20
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.

                                                                                                                 13
                                  RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules



Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders22 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies23, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks24. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public25. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
- The making available right, as introduced by the Information Society Directive, is national
in scope. In RTL Group’s view, content is made available in the Member States where it can
be accessed.



21
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
22
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
23
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
24
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
25
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

                                                                                                               14
                             RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules




- Right holders can determine through technical means in which territories content can be
accessed, therefore there is no uncertainty as to “where” it is being made available. Potential
interpretation issues can be dealt with through licensing negotiations and national courts/the
Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) are best placed to handle any disputes.
- An extension of the country-of-origin principle to linear and non-linear audiovisual media
services would have serious adverse effects on the EU’s audiovisual creative industries. It
would (i) lead to the wiping out of licensing of rights by territory, which coupled with
exclusivity, is an important prerequisite for recouping the significant investment in
audiovisual productions; and (ii) undercut the principle of contractual freedom.

    Conclusion: The scope of the making available right in cross-border situations is
sufficiently clear. RTL Group does not support proposals such as the introduction of
extended collective licensing schemes, new forms of mandatory collective licensing or the
general extension of the country-of-origin principle to linear and non-linear online
distribution. Each of these proposals would undermine copyright and the acquis
communautaire.



9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief26)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
- Please see question 8. RTL Group does not see a need to clarify the scope of the making
available right and such an option may have unwanted consequences in the overall
sustainability of the audiovisual creative industries.




2.       Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?



26
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                 15
                              RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules




   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands,
legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")
- From a commercial broadcaster perspective, the separate clearance of the reproduction right
and the communication to the public right for online activities causes unwanted complexity
and costs. In this regard, the assignment by certain right holders of these two rights to
different collective management organisations seems hard to justify. It would it be preferable
to require that for online exploitations these rights be bundled together and cleared through a
single entity.
- In this regard, RTL Group would like to call the attention of the European Commission to
relevant case law at Member State level (e.g. Myvideo case in Germany, where the Court of
Appeal in Munich argued that there cannot be an artificial split of a single act of economic
exploitation27).


    Conclusion: for online exploitations, RTL Group supports the bundling of the
reproduction right and the communication to the public right and their clearance in a single
transaction done through a single entity. Recent case law at national level seems to support
the view that this may be achievable by the market without the need for legislative reform.




3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU28 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU29 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
     YES –    Specific circumstance: deep links / embedding or framing
- A distinction must be made between “simple” hyperlinks and “deep” links or
embedding/framing. While the former are a mere reference to a source where it may be
possible to access content (and where access to the specific work is not achieved directly), the

latter lead directly to the viewing/execution of the content, often in a platform different than
the one intended by the right holder.
- Deep links/embedding are often used by third parties for the unauthorised transmission of
right holders’ content on their own platforms (e.g. pirates embedding content from RTL
Group servers on their website). This damages the online platforms of commercial free-to-air
broadcasters, as they generally rely on advertising which is then bypassed.
- RTL Group agrees with the analysis of ALAI in its report and opinion30 on the making
available and communication to the public in the Internet environment focusing on linking
techniques on the Internet, which states that the linking to targeted content infringes the
“making available” right if (i) the content is initially made available without the right holder’s
consent; or (ii) technical protection measures have been circumvented.
- This reasoning is in line with the stated aim of the Information Society Directive to adapt
and complete the rules of copyright and related rights to take into account economic realities
such as new forms of exploitation (recitals 4, 9, 11), and which leads to a wide interpretation
of the reproduction right and the right of communication to the public (recitals 21 and 23).


      NO –       Specific circumstance: simple hyperlinks (i.e. mere references to a source)
- As explained above, when hyperlinks are a mere reference to a source where it may be
possible to access content (and where access to the specific work is not achieved directly), the
question of whether or not the communication to the public right is triggered may depend on
whether or not a new audience is reached, as recently confirmed by the CJEU in Case C-
466/12 (Nils Svensson and Others v Retriever Sverige AB) of 13 February 2014.

   Conclusion: RTL Group believes that deep links and embedding/framing leading directly
to the execution/viewing of content may trigger the communication to the public right,
subject to a case-by-case assessment. In line with the recent Svensson judgment, this should
not be the case when hyperlinks are simply a reference to a source where it may be possible
to access content (and assuming a “new” public is not reached).




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
      YES –       Under specific circumstances
- RTL Group does not oppose an exception for the temporary reproduction of a work on the
screen or in the cache memory of an end user’s computer, as long as this is restricted to
(legal) private use.
- With regard to commercial users, when there is authorisation of the right holder to make a
certain work available and it is technically necessary to temporarily reproduce it, it also seems
reasonable to accept such an exception.

                                                                                                        17
                                 RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules




- However, care should be given to make sure that such an exception cannot be abused and
harm the commercial exploitation of the right holder. Viewing of illegally streamed
audiovisual content (i.e. without the right holder’s approval) does not fall under temporary
reproduction in line with Article 5 (1) (b) of the Copyright Directive31.
- It is also important to ensure coherent policies when dealing with new forms of exploitation.
For example, levies are collected in Germany for content that is acquired via download-to-
own but this does not happen for content that is streamed. In the long term, this will
undermine right holders’ ability to re-invest in content, as streaming is increasingly becoming
the technology of choice to view audiovisual content online.


   Conclusion: RTL Group does not oppose an exception for the temporary reproduction of
a work on screen or in the cache memory of an end user’s computer, as long as (i) its use is
restricted to (legal) private use or (ii) otherwise needed for technical reasons within the scope
of an authorised use. However, care should be taken to ensure that right holders’ ability to re-
invest in content is not undermined as a result.




4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)32. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)33. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).




31
   It should be noted that incidental reproduction is conclusively regulated in German Copyright law (§ 44a):
“temporary reproduction” is allowed as an exception of copyright, as long as it happens only due to technical
reasons or to make possible a legal use of the protected content, and as long as this reproduction has no
economic value on its own.
32
   See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
33
   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              18
                              RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules




13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     NO OPINION


14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
- Exhaustion is a limitation to copyright that was conceived for physical goods in order to
allow the first buyer of an item to resell it without interference of the right holder. This
reflected (i) the perishable nature of physical goods and the loss of value suffered over time
due to wear and tear and (ii) the fact that, when a physical good is resold, it is no longer in the
possession of the original owner.
- Due to their nature, digital goods cannot be “exhausted” by distribution, as the resold item is
identical to the original and imperishable. One purchased digital copy could potentially be
resold millions of times, which would destroy the primary market. In addition, the digital
nature of the good makes it difficult to identify a particular ‘item’ and assess whether it has
been resold without complex technical protection measures.
- A general rule of non-exhaustion for communication to the public rights has been codified in
Article 3(3) of the Information Society Directive and Recital 29, which states that “the
question of exhaustion does not arise in the case of services and online services in particular”.
- The recent UsedSoft ruling by the CJEU is not a precedent for audiovisual content, which
has a different nature than computer software. As mentioned by the Commission, “the Court
was careful to emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs
Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to
the Information Society Directive”.

   Conclusion: due to their nature, digital goods cannot be “exhausted” by distribution, as
the resold item is identical to the original and imperishable. One purchased digital copy could
potentially be resold millions of times, which would destroy the primary market for
audiovisual content. The principle of exhaustion should therefore not apply to digital goods.




C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute34. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not



34
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.

                                                                                                     19
                                 RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules



have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered35.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     NO
- RTL Group believes the creation of a registration system at EU level would be extremely
complex and costly to implement and keep up-to-date, with limited added value (in practice)
to right holders. Such a system would require the adoption of common definitions (e.g. media,
territory) which would be impossible to implement.
- In addition, the database would never be complete, as non-EU originated works could not be
subject to a registration requirement. There are also several IP protection organisations such
as FRAPA36 (format rights protection) offering registration services on a voluntary basis,
which further illustrates that handling at EU level is unnecessary.

    Conclusion: The creation of a registration system at EU level for the identification and
licensing of works would not be helpful.



16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[No answer.]


17.       What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[No answer.]


18.       What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[No answer.]




D.        How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed37, and identify, variously, the work

35
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
36
   The Format Recognition and Protection Association (http://www.frapa.org/).
37
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

                                                                                                             20
                                 RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules



itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database38 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition39 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub40 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
- The use of identifiers on a voluntary basis is to be welcomed, but it should be recognised
that such mechanisms do not constitute licensing vehicles. Licensing of professionally-
produced audiovisual content should be done through individual commercial negotiation.
There should be no move toward standardisation of rights ownership and permissions
databases on a compulsory basis – their role should be an enabling one.
- RTL Group would support the adoption of identifiers (together with contact details for right
holders) rather than any complex database of rights ownership, which would be impossible to
maintain.


  Conclusion: The use of identifiers on a voluntary basis is to be welcomed, but licensing
of professionally-produced audiovisual content should be done through individual
commercial negotiation. There should be no move toward standardisation of rights
ownership and permissions databases on a compulsory basis.




E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention41 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and

                                RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules



producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
- RTL Group sees no justification for terms of protection to be shortened. They have been and
remain an important factor in right holders’ decisions to invest in the funding of creative
works. This is especially true for audiovisual content, where significant investments are
needed upfront to finance what is an expensive, collaborative and typically long creative
process.




 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC42.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law43. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)44, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional45, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.

                                RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules



may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")46.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
- In the event of a targeted review of limitations and exceptions, RTL Group would support
the adoption of a mandatory list across the whole EU. This would avoid the risk of service
providers adopting a “forum shopping” approach in Member States with unclear exceptions
and/or ineffective enforcement.
- However, this list would have to be drafted extremely carefully to ensure that exceptions and
limitations are not abused by third parties. In particular, certain online service providers are
now offering commercial services which use broadcasters’ content/signal under a supposed
private copy exception (as explained in section IV of this questionnaire).
- Such an approach on limitations and exceptions needs to be looked at three-dimensionally
and in parallel with other policy areas in order to ensure the sustainability of the whole
audiovisual ecosystem. In particular, this needs to be done in connection with signal
protection/integrity for broadcasters, a strong framework ensuring net neutrality, effective
civil enforcement of IP rights and contractual freedom applied to licensing practices.
- As an example of the possible dangers of this approach, the extension of copyright
exceptions that has been proposed in the UK has the potential to greatly harm the industry
(e.g. extending fair dealing “by quotation” could have an unintentional consequence of
allowing all licensing to be fair dealt including primary licences). The European Commission
should therefore proceed carefully if such an option is taken.


46
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           23

   Conclusion: In the event of a targeted review of limitations and exceptions, RTL Group
would support the adoption of a mandatory list across the whole EU. However, this would
need to be done extremely carefully to ensure that they are not abused by third parties (e.g.
online service providers/pirates/etc.) to breach or circumvent right holders’ exclusive rights.



22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
   YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
- Please refer to answer 21.


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
- There is need for clarification that the viewing of obviously illegally streamed audiovisual
content does not fall under temporary reproduction, as provided for in art. 5 (a) of the
Copyright Directive, and is therefore breaching the copyright of the right holder.
- On the issue of user-generated content (UGC), please refer to our answer to question 58.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
   NO – Please explain why
Please refer to answer 25.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
- Fair-use provisions do not lead to greater clarity. There is still recurring litigation in the US
regarding what constitutes fair use (particularly in the online environment), despite the fact
that the concept was based on case law which was subsequently codified into the US
Copyright Act. The EU does not have the same legal tradition and it is not possible to simply
transpose the US system into 28 Member States.
- RTL Group believes further reflection is needed regarding who would truly benefit from a
fair use exception at EU level. Large enterprises such as Internet companies,
telecommunications operators or media conglomerates (and not creators) might be the main
beneficiaries of the uncertainty generated by a more “flexible” legal framework.
- In particular, this might lead to a situation where these companies would be able to free-ride
on content without proper remuneration of creators (e.g. through aggregation of
content/advertising/etc. without proper commercial discussions).

                                                                                                24
                                 RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules




- It should also be noted that providing greater flexibility in an environment where Member
States have different legal traditions would likely lead to a situation where a “fair use” in one
country would not be considered as such in another, with an increase in uncertainty and
lengthy referrals to the CJEU.


   Conclusion: Fair use provisions should not be implemented at EU level, as they would
create added uncertainty and litigation, particularly since they would have to be interpreted
by the courts of 28 different Member States. They would also potentially allow certain
companies to free-ride on content and undermine the ability of right holders to plan the
commercial exploitation of their works (which is a key factor in their decision to invest).




26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
     NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
Please see answer 21.


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[No answer.]




A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving47 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions48. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive49.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     NO OPINION


29.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[No answer.]


30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[No answer.]


31.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[No answer.]




2.      Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to

                                                                                           26

provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[No answer.]

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[No answer.]

34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[No answer.]

35.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[No answer.]




3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?




                                                                                             27
                               RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules




(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
     NO OPINION

37.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
- E-lending solutions by public libraries are an interesting possibility for consumers to access
all types of content. Due to the specific nature of audiovisual content as an experience good, it
is important to ensure that such offers do not end up being a substitute for the primary market.
For instance, this could potentially be achieved by providing adequate technical protection
measures; limiting access to a certain number of simultaneous e-lendings from the library
side; providing appropriate compensation to right holders; etc.


The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[No answer.]

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
- Please refer to question 37.




4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other50. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
50
          You will find more information about his MoU on                      the   following   website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .

                                                                                                      28

Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)51.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     NO OPINION
- Please refer to question 41.


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
     NO – Please explain
- Contractual solutions can address this issue where there is demonstrable demand. As a
general rule, there is no issue regarding clarity over who owns rights in audiovisual
productions. As an example, FMM’s catalogue dates back to the Thames programmes of the
1970s, and even in this case all right holders have been successfully identified.
- Neither a memorandum-of-understanding arrangement nor collective management
organisations are needed as a means of “mass digitisation” of audiovisual collections or
broadcasters’ archives. Neither should be implemented as a means of bypassing the clearance
process with right holders and the payment of fair remuneration.
- The recently adopted Directive on certain permitted uses of orphan works foresees legal
means to ensure that, where the right holders of certain works cannot be identified, there are
mechanisms ensuring that works are not lost.

    Conclusion: There is no general issue regarding uncertainty of rights ownership in
audiovisual productions. Neither memorandum-of-understanding arrangements nor collective
management organisations are needed as a means of “mass digitisation” of audiovisual
collections or broadcasters’ archives. Neither should be implemented as a means of
bypassing the clearance process with right holders and the payment of fair remuneration.




51
  France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC52 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
      NO OPINION

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[No answer.]
44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?

[No answer.]




C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC53 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC54 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 55.

The Marrakesh Treaty56 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?

Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?
      NO
- Please refer to question 51.


51.        If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
- From a commercial broadcaster’s perspective there are no copyright-related obstacles to
improve accessibility for disabled people. However, these measures are costly to implement
and RTL Group would encourage policy-makers to create incentives for their implementation
(such as greater flexibility on advertising restrictions, etc.).
- For example, in the Netherlands, public service broadcasters are granted a subsidy for the
implementation of accessibility measures (such as subtitling). Commercial broadcasters
should also be eligible for such subsidies in order to ensure fair competition.

   Conclusion: from a commercial broadcaster’s perspective there are no copyright-related
obstacles to improve accessibility for disabled people.



52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
[No answer.]




E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics57 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is

57
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              32
                                RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules



necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”58. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?

resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
[No answer.]



F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs59. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions60.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?

59
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
   NO
- RTL Group understands that in the digital age consumers expect clarity on what they can
and cannot do with professional audiovisual content. If the European Commission considers
introducing a new exception for user-generated content (UGC), proper care should however
be taken to ensure that this does not create an unfair commercial advantage for Internet
companies, telecommunications operators or media conglomerates allowing them to free-ride
on right holders’ content for commercial gain.
- A deeper analysis is therefore needed regarding the concepts of private and commercial use,
as the distinction is sometimes hard to establish in practice. While an individual consumer
may upload UGC (with RTL content) without commercial intent, that same UGC will be
aggregated, attract traffic and/or be used for advertising purposes by the hosting platform.
- In this case, the use of UGC by the hosting platform represents an indirect commercial
exploitation. While consumers should be allowed to use UGC in the scope of a private use,
commercial discussions need to take place between platforms with UGC-based business
models and the relevant right holders (in order to ensure a fair remuneration of all parties
involved).
- There are also other considerations that should be taken into account, such as ensuring that
UGC is not used in a way which damages the reputation/brand of the right holder and/or that
it does not misrepresent the original creative work.
- From a pure licensing standpoint, the market is already addressing the demand for UGC and
there are a number of technologies which allow this to be done effectively. Within RTL
Group there are many examples of measures undertaken to facilitate the licensing of UGC:

          • Many RTL Group profit centres allow fan-uploaded clips based on their content provided they are
under a certain number of minutes, including 'mash-ups' (re-edited clips);
          • On other platforms, a view is taken whether such UGC actually fulfils a promotional role or is
otherwise harmless and so can be left in place (e.g. on Facebook and Twitter, the dominant view is now that it is
acceptable to have non-official pages as well the official one) or whether to contact the user to ask them to
remove their content;
          • FMM is working with a company called Rightsline to enable one of its platforms
(www.fmearchive.com) to allow B2C and B2B users to license clips for personal, educational or commercial use
as appropriate. The typical use envisaged here would be for audiovisual presentations, corporate presentations,
educational research, school and college reports, etc.;
           • Another example is the “Verbotene Liebe” app from GrundyUFA, which allows users to cut and
repost material from the show on their Facebook profile (http://www.klatsch-tratsch.de/2013/03/02/verbotene-
liebe-die-erste-app-fur-eine-deutsche-daily-soap-ist-da/152809).

   Conclusion: if the European Commission considers introducing an exception for UGC, a
prior analysis is needed regarding the concepts of private and commercial use. While
consumers should be allowed to use UGC in the scope of a private use, proper care should be
taken to (i) ensure that commercial discussions take place between right holders and the
platform operator using UGC for indirect commercial exploitation; and (ii) preserve the
reputation/brand of the right holder.

experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient
in this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that
are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?
  YES – Please explain
[Answer to (b)]
- This is done on a case-by-case basis. For example, if an actor makes an appearance in one of
Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland’s shows / series and wishes to publish a show reel of his
work (including parts of content owned by RTL), the publishing of this content is allowed on
Clipfish.de.
- In Germany, RTL Group’s UFA has its own division for online activities including online
video production (UFA LAB), which operates YouTube channels, Facebook and Twitter
accounts. UFA’s online activities include the rap talent show “RAPUTATION”
(www.raputation.tv), which rewards the best political rap song written and performed by a
young talent; and “Your Chance” (www.yourchance.de), a talent and casting portal which
gives young people (actors, models, musicians, athletes, etc.) a potential entry point into their
respective industry.
- For that reason, the young talents mentioned above grant UFA a non-exclusive licence
(unlimited for content and region). This is necessary for showing their material online on
YouTube. For the ten finalists who are part of the talent show, the licence is exclusive so that
the best songs can be promoted exclusively by UFA.

     IV.   Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying61. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees6263.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions64 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
In relation to private copying and reprography exceptions, there are two distinct and separate
issues which in RTL Group’s view should be addressed by the European Commission:

1) Service providers should not be allowed to use broadcasters’ content for commercial
purposes by abusing the notion of a private copy exception – this should be done
through licensing
- An increasing problem faced by commercial broadcasters is the proliferation of new services
enabling users to consume TV content in a non-linear manner, but which do not seek
authorisation for the use of their signal/content (e.g. network PVR services).
- These new players offer a commercial service to consumers by abusing the notion of a
“private copy”, using professional TV content in a parasitical way and in breach of
broadcasters’ exclusive rights. Clarification is needed that such services operate outside the
scope of a private copy exception and that commercial discussions (i.e. licensing) should
always precede their use of right holders’ content/signal.

                             RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules




- Furthermore, it should be noted that these services operate outside the audiovisual
production ecosystem. They do not refinance the programme investments or license
programming, but nevertheless generate their own revenues on the basis of broadcasters’
content (e.g. through advertising overlays, sale of set-top-boxes, monthly subscription fees
paid by users, etc.).
- It should be noted that case law in Germany has already clarified that (i) when a network
PVR service is based on a master copy accessed by its subscribers, this involves a
communication to the public; and (ii) when the service is based on individual storage space, it
involves an act of retransmission65. In both of these situations the authorisation of the
broadcaster must be sought, which is an approach supported by RTL Group.

2) Commercial broadcasters should benefit from private copy remuneration
- When licensing is impossible in practice (i.e. for situations actually covered by the private
copy exception), levies remain an important tool to compensate right holders for copies made
of their content. However, commercial broadcasters do not currently benefit from private
copy remuneration despite their substantial investments in the production of professional
audiovisual content.
- This situation does not make sense at a time when commercial broadcasters’ content is one
of the most widely copied worldwide. It is essential that they also benefit from private copy
remuneration on fair and equitable terms with other categories of right holders.
- Clarification is therefore needed at EU level that all right holders (i.e. including commercial
broadcasters) must be compensated by means of private copying levies in Member States
where this exception has been implemented. This was concluded by the CJEU in the recent
cases Padawan (paragraph 36) and Stichting De Thuiskopie (paragraphs 22 and 34).

Other issues
- Moreover, it is important to (i) clarify that any goods used for copying are within the scope
of private copying levies (e.g. blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines,
mobile listening services, mp3/mp4 players, computers, memory sticks, etc.); and (ii) that
private copying should only be allowed from an original copy (i.e. it should be forbidden to
let a third party make the copy).


     Conclusion:
1) Service providers should not be allowed to use broadcasters’ content for commercial
purposes without consent by abusing the notion of a private copy exception. Clarification is
needed that these services operate outside the scope of a private copy exception and that
commercial discussions (i.e. licensing) should always precede their use of right holders’
content/signal.
2) Commercial broadcasters should benefit from private copy remuneration on fair and
equitable terms with other categories of right holders. The CJEU has concluded in recent
case law that all right holders must be compensated by means of private copying levies in
Member States where this exception has been implemented.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?66
     YES – Please explain
Please refer to our answer in question 64.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
- Please see question 64. As previously mentioned, it is important to (i) clarify that any goods
used for copying are within the scope of private copying levies (e.g. blank media, recording
equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening services, mp3/mp4 players, computers,
memory sticks, etc.); and (ii) that private copying should only be allowed from an original
copy (i.e. it should be forbidden to let a third party make the copy).


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?67
     NO OPINION


Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments68.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
     NO OPINION

69.    What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers69 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract70. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[No answer.]

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
      NO – Please explain why

                                  RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules




- The professional audiovisual business is a collaborative effort. Broadcasters, producers,
authors and performers rely on each other’s talent and expertise in a business where success is
difficult to predict. Broadcasters and/or producers usually finance projects upfront and bear
the risk of flops without passing on this financial risk to the creative counterpart.
- Producers’ role and expertise is to seek the best possible commercial exploitation for
audiovisual content (including internationally) in order to ensure that investments are
recouped and re-invested in new content. This virtuous circle sustains thousands of creative
jobs and is only possible if they are able to act as a central point for all the rights in an
audiovisual work.
- This benefits the whole creative value chain and, ultimately, consumers – by giving them a
wider choice of high-quality content. Introducing new unwaivable rights for authors and
performers would prevent their centralisation in the producer, lead to increasing
dispersion/fragmentation of rights, make licensing slower and more difficult, and ultimately
hamper the accessibility of content to consumers.
- RTL Group does not see the need to address this negotiation between producers and
authors/performers at EU level. There are many examples in our business which illustrate that
negotiations are in most cases a market-driven, case-by-case commercial negotiation (where
different authors/performers with different track records will have different negotiating
power, as in any other business). A full assignment of copyright is not a deal-breaker or a
“take-it-or-leave-it” proposition.
- In addition, copyright contract law is a matter of Member State competence. In fact, many of
the calls for changes at EU level are already implemented at national level.
           • Germany: in German copyright law, §§ 32 ff UrhG establishes fair and equitable remuneration as a
constitutive principle - every creator has the right, even retroactively, to claim modification of a licence contract
with respect to remuneration if the original payments received by the creator turn out to be non-equitable in
comparison to the revenues of the licensee;
           • France: in principle, a percentage is negotiated with authors and performers. Buy-outs are in
principle not allowed by French law, except under very restrictive conditions. Equitable remuneration and fair
payment are organised in major part by the French collecting societies (e.g. SACEM, SACD, SCAM). Work
made for hire does not exist;
          • The Netherlands: fair and equitable remuneration for authors contributing to an audiovisual work is
provided for in Dutch copyright law (article 45d). The payment of the remuneration is legally enforceable from
the producer of the audiovisual work. Music authors are compulsorily represented by collecting societies. A new
proposal for the Copyright Act provides for a ban on buy out-clauses;
          • In the UK there are, as an example, Talent Union Agreements for actors, writers and musicians
which allow FMM to license works internationally in all media and which then prompt the payment of a share of
the income received to these artists.


   Conclusion: introducing new unwaivable rights for authors and performers would lead to
increasing dispersion/ fragmentation of rights; prevent their centralisation in the producer and
therefore make licensing slower and more difficult; and ultimately hamper the accessibility
of content to consumers. RTL Group does not see the need to address this negotiation at EU
level.

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
[No answer.]




     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE71 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text72. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose73. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure74. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
- Digitisation has led to the convergence of different media: viewing devices like smart TVs
combine both linear TV and online services on one screen. This presents new challenges, as
there is an increasing number of online service providers which use broadcasters’ TV content
in a parasitical way, for example by overlaying their own advertising. This breaches
broadcasters’ exclusive rights and poses significant difficulties from a (cross-border) civil
enforcement point-of-view.
- RTL Group operations will typically seek to enforce their IPR within their home country but
will often not pursue infringements if they occur abroad, particularly with regard to online.
The costs associated with the need to seek local legal advice and the uncertainty/length of
proceedings act as deterrents in seeking civil enforcement abroad. In addition, compensation
of a proved infringement almost never compensates the actual loss of revenue (and/or profits
made by the infringer).

of intellectual property rights.

   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
73
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
74
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           42
                              RTL Group / Review of EU copyright rules




- Broadcasters increasingly face issues related to the unauthorised retransmission of their live
signal in the online environment75, in particular when it comes to premium sports events. The
dynamics of these cases imply that it is very important for right holders to be able to take
quick action against infringers, particularly when these can easily re-configure their technical
infrastructure in order to remain online. In addition, the time needed for preliminary
injunctions to be imposed on infringers is excessive in many Member States76.
- In light of the above, model rules at EU level for fast-track proceedings for civil law cases
concerning infringements of IPR would be helpful in allowing right holders to more
effectively protect their investments (and also avoid destruction of evidence in the online
environment).


Broadcasters’ retransmission right
- RTL Group operations often face difficulties enforcing their rights due to cable operators not
acknowledging retransmission rights. Clarification is needed at EU level that contravening the
right of retransmission represents an infringement of copyright.
- For example, some cable operators in France and Bulgaria take Mediengruppe RTL
Deutschland’s signal from the satellite feed and are not willing to engage in commercial
discussions, as they are aware that there are no supervisory authorities in their respective
countries with the power/mandate to deal with the situation.


Public viewings of broadcasts
- The broadcaster’s exclusive right to perform its broadcast signals in public (e.g. public
viewing in case of sport events – in Germany “Kneipenrecht”) should not be limited to cases
where the public is obliged to pay an entrance fee, but also apply to any case where the
broadcaster’s signal is used and performed for (direct or indirect) profit-making purposes.
- As an example, it has become commonplace to offer public viewings in bars, restaurants and
clubs, and the owners of the venue profit by selling more beverages at higher prices without
paying licence fees to broadcasters. Broadcasters should be remunerated for such commercial
use of their signal in public, since they invest heavily in the programmes being shown at
public viewings.


    Conclusion: Broadcasters face a particular set of challenges with regard to IP
enforcement in the online environment, in particular piracy of their live signal and the breach
of their retransmission right. Model rules at EU level for fast-track proceedings for civil law
cases concerning infringements of IPR would be helpful.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
- RTL Group believes that Article 8(3) of the Information Society Directive is an important
tool in achieving cooperation from intermediaries, in so far as it is correctly implemented in
Member States. However, there is a need to address IP protection at various levels, from
WIPO (e.g. successfully concluding the Broadcasters’ Treaty negotiations) to ensuring the
voluntary cooperation of intermediaries with right holders.
- Effective self-regulatory initiatives in this field are important for right holders, particularly
in a context where infringement can easily take place outside the EU’s borders. The European
Commission should support initiatives seeking increased cooperation with intermediaries, as
support from Internet companies operating at a global level can be extremely effective when
implemented correctly.
- As an example of situations where cooperation with intermediaries would be useful, RTL
Group is not able to effectively pursue pirates located outside the EU. The only way to react
in these cases is to press third party services they need to operate (for example, Internet
service providers, search engines, hosting service providers, payment intermediaries and
advertising services).
- There are a number of self-regulatory initiatives at national level in Germany, Austria and
the UK involving the advertising sector (e.g. “Follow the money”). The aim of these is to
prevent advertising on websites which are clearly illegal. As an example, in Germany the
initiative of the ZAW is based on a self-regulation codex.
- However, these initiatives are not sufficient by themselves, as they are (so far) based on
participants’ good will and do not yet represent a reliable enforcement tool. Mediengruppe
RTL Deutschland has tried, for instance, to bring payment service providers to stop offering
their services to websites promoting illegal content but so far with no success.
- National initiatives against IP infringement are also a good example that could be expanded
at EU level. The US Administration’s efforts in this area can serve as a good model, as it
encouraged the advertising networks to establish best practices in order to reduce advertising
revenue that supports online infringement. It also facilitates and encourages the dialogue
among different private sector entities that provide basic functionalities on the Internet
(including name registries and registrars, search engines, cyberlockers and other types of
storage services).
- Regarding the liability of access providers, it should be noted that Advocate General Cruz
Villalón considered in his Opinion in UPC Telekabel Wien that an Internet provider can be
required to block access by its customers to a website which infringes copyright, as long as
such an injunction refers to specific blocking measures and achieves an appropriate balance
with fundamental rights.
- Among other measures that intermediaries could implement to support online distribution of
content are for example the invention and promotion of easy and accessible micro-payment
systems.

    Conclusion: RTL Group urges the European Commission to encourage the cooperation of
 intermediaries in combating IP infringements (e.g. Internet service providers, search engines,
 hosting service providers, payment intermediaries and advertising services). In parallel,
 strong IP enforcement frameworks both within and outside the EU are essential to ensure a
 high level of protection for audiovisual creators (e.g. at WIPO-level).



77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
   NO OPINION




   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
   NO


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[No answer.]




VIII.      Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.


                                                                                            45

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
WIPO Broadcasters’ Treaty
- It should be noted that at WIPO level broadcasters have not benefitted from the same
protection when compared to other categories of right holders. For example, on neighbouring
rights, international rules to protect television broadcasts from piracy have not been updated
since the 1961 Rome treaty, drafted at a time when cable was in its infancy and the Internet
not even invented. This extends to shorter terms of protection.
- Coordinated EU action at this level is needed for a successful conclusion to the on-going
negotiation of the WIPO Treaty on the Protection of Broadcasting Organisations. RTL Group
strongly encourages the European Commission to support the completion and adoption of a
new Broadcasters’ Treaty in WIPO as a priority.
- It is essential that the Broadcasters’ Treaty contain relevant protection for broadcasters
operating in the twenty-first century. The starting point is to provide broadcasters with rights
which belong in the same “family” as the rights granted to authors under the Berne
Convention and the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT); and to phonogram producers and
performers under the Rome Convention, the WIPO Performers and Phonogram Producers
Treaty (WPPT) and the Beijing Audiovisual Performances Treaty (BAVPT).
- A signal-based and technologically neutral approach for the protection of broadcasters is a
good starting point in providing a sufficient measure of protection (by focusing on their rights
in the signal, separate and apart from the underlying content). RTL Group remains available
to discuss this in greater detail.
