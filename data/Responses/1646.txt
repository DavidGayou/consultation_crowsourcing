   I. Introduction

A.    Context of the consultation
Over the last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created, distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content - for
information,  education  or  entertainment   purposes   -   regardless   of
geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy
and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in  2014  on  whether  to
table legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[2]. The Commission
welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact that  two  groups  -
user-generated content and text and data mining - did not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of the  legislative
framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication on  Content  in  the
Digital Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to  improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement  while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform ".  As  highlighted  in
the  October  2013  European  Council  Conclusions[3]  "Providing   digital
services and content across the single market requires the establishment of
a copyright regime for the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its ongoing review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings,  in
particular those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[4], the "Green Paper on the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[5] and "Content Online"[6]. These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible  ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to  the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders' remuneration, particularly in the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,  distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way to
proceed. The "Green Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed  into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A. Why is it not possible to  access  many  online  content  services  from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights - e.g. writers, singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead, they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is  limited  to
the territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[7].
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet - e.g.  by
a music streaming service, or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  -  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence,
such that content services can be provided in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[8] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[9];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue "Licences for  Europe"[10]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[11].
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them  when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives
of the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the further  development  of  cross-
border portability[12].
Despite progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to, services. These problems are most  obvious  to
consumers wanting to access services that  are  made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all online  services  are
available in all Member States and consumers face problems when  trying  to
access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the  "same"
service is available in all Member  States,  consumers  cannot  access  the
service across borders (they can only access their "national" service,  and
if they try to access the "same" service in another Member State  they  are
redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing  of   rights   in   different
territories. Contractual clauses  in  licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be
taken at EU level in the  medium  term[13]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.

1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced  problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than  the
one in which you live?

X YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)
The problem exists in all member states, including my own: it is impossible
to get information on all authors, involved in Artistic productions, be  it
in theatre (any performing arts), literary, design or Virtual by character.
It is therefore impossible to be informed of current and future moments  of
expression by a specific author, although  this  information  is  available
with producers and platforms.

2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have  you  faced  problems
when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?

X YES - Please explain whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g. business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audiovisual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and  newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).
Privacy regulations as well as a misunderstanding of the potential value of
existing databases  prevent  the  sharing  of  marketing  information  with
authors and audiences. Another problem is that there  is  not  one  uniform
system of registering authors, involved with artistic production.

3. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences?
Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year  and  provide
examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the  type  of  content
concerned.

[Open question]

4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of  the  questions
above - what would be the best way to tackle them?

We are now proposing  a  URR  (universal  registration  of  rights)  to  be
connected to each product(ion) containing author's rights By developing the
systems of Unique ID's. Any  product,  that  in  its  product  code  has  a
connection to the URR-registry would be protected. A product that does  not
have this reference to the URR system  will  be  'free  of  rights'.  If  a
product is marketed without the URR-reference, although it is registered to
have one, this product will be illegal.


Through  the  URR  any  customer/buyer/consumer  can  know   all   involved
authors(artists) as well  as  the  provenance1  of  the  product.  (compare
Bitcoin11 . In stead of 'mined mathematical units', in the URR the base  of
value is authorship.)

5. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all  the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still  find
it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on  a  service
provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain  content
is not possible in certain European countries) ?
X YES -
The essence of URR is that providers will need  the  legal  base  to  block
access to content without the correct URR code as soon as they are informed
that such content should have an embedded URR-code, to all territories they
disseminate to.
URR is not  a  'collective  rights  management'  system,  but  foremost,  a
collective system for the management of individual rights.
These rights (read: authorship) transcend the mere  financial  arrangements
that accompany material or  virtual  consumption  of  a  product  that  has
authors, but they also represent a form of communication between author and
consumer. If, at any step in the  chain  of  transference  from  author  to
consumer, the URR is stripped from the  product,  this  fact  alone  should
provide justification for the provider to block the product.

6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:]  Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the  necessary
rights for all the  territories  in  question,  you  would  still  find  it
necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions  on  the  service
recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to  a  different
website than the one he is trying to access)?
X YES -
The essence of URR is that providers will need  the  legal  base  to  block
access to content without the correct URR code as soon as they are informed
that such content should have an embedded URR-code, to all territories they
disseminate to. (see above, question 5)

Ί NO

Ί NO OPINION

7. Do you think  that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) are needed at  EU  level  to  increase  the
cross-border availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
X YES -
Legislative measures are  necessary  in  order  to  facilitate  the  direct
relationship  between  authors  and   consumers;   not   only   to   manage
remuneration, but more importantly, to facilitate the marketing of artistic
products that are in essence niche-products for niches of  consumers.  Once
authors are 'embedded', with a unique code, in the products of  which  they
are the authors, or, in which they share authorship,  the  full  profit  of
'long tail marketing111' can be set in motion. Once the URR is established,
European legislation can produce an immense  simplification  of  the  whole
issues of  author's  rights  and  copyrights  in  general,  thus  not  only
streamlining the processing of author's  financial  rights  after  sale  or
consumption, but foremost, to use  authorship  as  a  marketing  tool  that
facilitates future contact between authors and consumers, and  thus  future
sales, by connecting each niche of authors with  the  niche  of  interested
consumers in the mist efficient way.


B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of  what  needs  to
be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[14]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[15]
and databases[16].

Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[17] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.
The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[18],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission - e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  -  and
at the users' end - e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[19].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1. The act of "making available"
Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  "making  available"
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  "targeting"  of  a  certain   Member   State's
public[20]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  "targeted"
by the online service provider. A service  provider  "targets"  a  group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a  language  or  a  currency
specifically targeted at that group.

8. Is the scope of the "making available" right in  cross-border  situations
— i.e. when content is disseminated across borders — sufficiently clear?
□ YES
X NO - Please explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[21])

The 'border' issue, as long as it exist, will always obscure the  basically
simple relationship between an author, a product, and a consumer. There  is
only one aspect in this relationship that should be involved, and  that  is
'national  taxation'  in   the   relative   countries   of   costumer   and
author/producer. To create transparency here, is the responsibility of  the
national authorities. At the moment this process  of  taxation  is  totally
obscuring the transfer of professional content.

□ NO OPINION

9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification  of  the
territorial scope of the "making available" right have  an  effect  on  the
recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author
or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not),
on your remuneration, or  on  the  enforcement  of  rights  (including  the
availability of injunctive relief4)?
□ YES -
X NO - Once the URR is in effect, the  above  mentioned  problem  does  not
exist any more, since all information  regarding  this  issue  (aside  from
taxation) is directly related to the URR code,  embedded  in  the  product.
This is a collateral effect of the URR.

□ NO OPINION

2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right and  the
making available right. This may complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the  two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.

10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:]  Does  the
application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in  the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?
□ YES - Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")
The URR is the solution to this problem, therefor my answer is under NO:
□ NO -
In the URR - database is also a field of the (original) author or producer
as an author that represents the rights of the other authors (in case of co-
authorship). Any actor that commits reproduction or creates new
availability needs consent through this representative, and, consequently
creates a new URR code to the 'next version' of the product that he/she
wishes to transfer. If he/she does not do this, he/she is not integrated as
co-producer in the URR and will therefore not be remunerated. He/She is, in
that case, just a consumer. When selling this product, a part of the price
is automatically transferred to the authors, but not to him/her.
□ NO OPINION

3. Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the
Internet to another. They are indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are pending  before  the  CJEU[22]  in
which the question has been raised whether the  provision  of  a  clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter  protected   under
copyright on the screen and in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[23] as to whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception  for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other  subject
matter protected under copyright,  either  in  general  or  under  specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
Ί YES - Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general,
or under specific circumstances, and
why
X NO - Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public - or to a new public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)
Again, in the end, the URR solves this problem, since all end-users will be
able (and thus obliged) to perform a micro-payment directly to the authors,
per viewing or per download. 'free' downloads to caches etc, will no longer
happen, because consumers will need to actively accept them and accept to
pay the fee, unless the content is URR-free.
Since in this way, 'free' content will - in the end- only be content
generated by nonprofessionals, the market for deep-linking providers will
become less profitable and therefore loose its current attraction and
significance.
□ NO OPINION


12. Should the viewing of a  web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on
the screen and in the cache  memory  of  the  user's  computer,  either  in
general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of
the rightholder?
J YES - Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general,
or under specific circumstances, and
why
X NO - Because, once the URR is embedded in  the  product,  no  viewing  or
temporary storage will be 'free' anymore. Each transfer will need agreement
by the consumer, trough a micro- payment. Consumers of professional content
will become aware of their consumption, and their payment to the authors.
□ NO OPINION

4. Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g.
download to own). Questions arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article)[24].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in the
case of an act of transmission equivalent in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)[25].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a  copy  of  a  work
after they have "re-sold" it - this is often referred to  as  the  "forward
and delete" question) as well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

13. [In particular if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
restrictions when trying to resell digital files that  you  have  purchased
(e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
- YES - Please explain by giving examples

X NO - since I do not try to resell. If I would resell virtual  possessions
with an URR-code embedded, the new owner needs to register as the new owner
in the URR- system, and pay the correct percentage to the owners  in  order
not to be registered as an illegal owner, or a non- owner (or: thief). This
is the issue of following rights,  and  the  issue  of  provenance  of  the
product. Again: see the Bitcoin-system.

14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service  provider:]  What
would be the consequences of  providing  a  legal  framework  enabling  the
resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify  per  market
(type of content) concerned.
[Open question]


Resale implies following-rights or related rights. With the URR embedded in
a product, or applied to the product (as in the ISBN on a  book)  ownership
of the product is automatically registered in  order  to  be  'the  owner'.
(this information is, however, only accessible under  the  conditions  that
the  community  of  users  of  the  URR  database  allow.)  This  concerns,
therefore, only 'professional' content.

C. Registration of works and other subject matter - is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights. However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[26]. Moreover a system of registration does not need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and  with   the   increased
opportunities that digital technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration
are increasingly being considered[27].

15. Would the creation of a registration system at  EU  level  help  in  the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?
X YES
J NO
J NO OPINION

16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
In the system of URR, any form of professional content would have its  code
embedded or applied. A product would therefore always be a link between one
or  more  authors/creators,  one  or  more  producers/facilitators,  and  a
consumer. This system will then 'see' the professional content as  what  it
is: a means of communication, prior to being an  economic  entity,  and  it
will allow the professional creators to exist as such on the base of  their
work. It will allow a direct niche to  niche  marketing  channel  in  which
artists will always be able to inform their markets, and in which consumers
always will find the content they are interested in, before a  product  has
failed because of the lack of this channel.

17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
The transfer from the existing system of 'defence' of the right of  authors
by a myriad of institutions to  the  URR  will  be  significant,  and  will
transform the function of institutes that deal with collective  aspects  of
right management. These institutions will become of secondary significance,
since the main flow of payments would go directly from the consumer to  the
authors. Again, this is only a collateral effect of the URR system
18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


The recognition of being a 'professional content' (co)creator and the
guarantee to the revenues that this content creates.

D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held  by
producers, collective management organisations, and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,  internationally   agreed   'identifiers'.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[28], and identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking
actions to improve the interoperabil^ of such  identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire Database[29]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of musical  works
worldwide. The Linked Content  Coalition[30]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a Rights
Reference Model (RRM) - a comprehensive data model for all types of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[31] is seeking to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.

19. What should be the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption  of
identifiers in the content sector, and in  promoting  the  development  and
interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

To actively facilitate this process by its  standardisation  organisations.
However, this process  should  be  organised  by  the  authors  themselves;
through their national unions and through FIA, for instance. The system  of
identifiers needs to be given a framework as to not create  overlapping  of
systems. Authors, in essence, are not bound by  national  boundaries.  They
need to be able to  change  address,  discipline,  or  even  name,  without
loosing their identity in the URR. The same goes for consumers, by the way.
All of them need the  basic  rights  that  any  database  that  deals  with
personal information should guarantee.

E. Term of protection - is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with  the
applicable national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[32]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

20. ^4re the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
digital environment?

J YES - Please explain

X NO - Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
They should be systematized and, in general slightly  longer.  However  the
question is somewhat misleading, since a) they are already not  appropriate
in the non-digital


environment, and b) the question whether they  apply  to  digital  or  non-
digital environments should be irrelevant to the matter.

  III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable  the  use
of  works  and  other  protected   subject-   matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC[33].
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[34].   In   accordance   with   international
obligations, the EU acquis requires that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised  at
EU level)[35], these limitations and exceptions are often optional[36],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting  that
not all of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[37]
The cross-border effect of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders. In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are  used
for illustration in an online course given by an  university  in  a  Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of  that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member  States'  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain  uses   the
authorisation of rightholders is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,  and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

21. Are there problems arising from the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for  the
Member States?


1 YES - Please explain by referring to specific cases X NO - Please explain
Authors should not depend on directives on  national  levels  in  order  to
manage the benefits arising from they status as authors. As long as they do
not organize themselves, they will be subordinated  to  the  whims  of  the
markets, and the producers. There is no sane  solution  except  through  an
identifier system that they manage themselves.
22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
X YES - Limitations such as the right to fair use should  be  part  of  the
system and be harmonized on a high level, such as the European  level,  but
this should not be done through legislation;  it  should  be  part  of  the
'conditions for sale' that authors and producers agree upon. After this has
happened, there may be use of some legislation to support this,  but  maybe
this is not necessary.

23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to  or  removed  from
the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
Ideally, all limitations  and  exceptions  should  be  transferred  to  the
conditions of sale, and inserted in the  URR  system.  Products  that  have
'author's rights inside' may even  vary  in  these  limitations  if  it  is
possible to develop an algorithm that deals with the consequences.( If such
an algorithm  is  not  possible  there  is  a  high  probability  that  the
limitation is not practicable anyway)

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to  provide  for
a  greater  degree  offlexibility  in  the  EU  regulatory  framework   for
limitations and exceptions?

X YES - Please explain why
Because through the system of URR, all limitations and exceptions that  are
definable and executable through an algorithm that is agreed  upon  by  the
authors  and  producers  can  automatically  be  implemented.  Since   this
possibility will be obvious, the need will automatically surface.

25. If yes, what would be the best  approach  to  provide  for  flexibility?
(e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions  of
the directives, interpretations by the  Commission,  built-in  flexibility,
e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)
? Please explain indicating what  would  be  the  relative  advantages  and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible  effects  on  the
functioning of the Internal Market.

As indicated under 23, the definition and implementation will  be  built-in
in the system.  The  consequence  will  be  an  immense  simplification  of
procedures on the level of legislative control and (therefore) regulation.

26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in   your
experience, constitute a problem?
X YES - since the market for author-driven (=copyright-driven) products  is
essentially unrelated to national boundaries.

27. In the event that limitations and exceptions  established  at  national
level were to have cross-border effect, how should the  question  of  "fair
compensation "  be  addressed,  when  such  compensation  is  part  of  the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)


As stated above, this is one of the main reasons to lift these  limitations
out opf the legislation and transfer them to the  conditions  of  sale  and
have them implemented automatically as a consequence.

A. Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of  publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of  preservation  and
archiving[38] and enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the collections  of  such  institutions[39].  The  public
lending (under an exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the Rental
and Lending Directive[40].

Questions arise as to whether the current framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this  may   cause   to
rightholders. The role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1. Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records,  or  films)  -
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works - may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national  laws
allowing for the making of such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of
beneficiary establishments, the types of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

28. (a)
(b) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?
X YES - I would not be opposed that a book, of which I am the main  author,
would be included in the google preservation project. However,  since  this
whole project is made immensely complicated by the fact  that  the  current
organizing parties consider the rights as a collective right, in  stead  of
as a collectively organised structure of dealing with individual rights, it
has become unmanageable. For the group of authors there would be no problem
to complete the URR database of authors (with the  author  ID's)  for  this
book, including its rights management, and subsequently  integrate  it  in,
for instance, the ISBN, being the product code.

29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

By the fact that there will no longer be such a thing  as  'free'  content.
All content will generate its own income from the users, and all users will
pay a small fee for use. Always. Content that needs to  be  preserved  will
mostly be out of the copyright-period (but  not  always).  Institutes  that
have the task to preserve these works will need to add the authors  to  the
URR of the

particular work, and themselves as one of  the  producers.  This  goes  for
google as well as for any museum or guarded monument.

30. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions  should
be covered and under which conditions?

There is no need for a legislative solution, but for a legislative  support
of the solution that must be organized by the market. (again, the  ISBN  as
an example was never 'a  legislative'  solution.  It  is,  by  its  nature,
profitable for all partners involved, and therefore wanted by all  partners
involved. Once this URR is implemented in the product, there is a need  for
legislation that covers fraud and, for instance, the  deletion  of  an  URR
with the intent to trade the product that belongs  with  it  in  the  'non-
professional' market. As there is legislation on all fraud  with  contracts
in trade.

31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

See the answer to 30.

2. Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

32. (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
experienced specific problems when  trying  to  negotiate  agreements  with
rights holders that enable you to provide remote access,  including  across
borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for  purposes  of  research
and private study?
b) [In particular if you are an end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of the
institutions in question?
c)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,  to  the  works  or  other
subject- matter in their collections, for purposes of research and  private
study?
a) ...
b) - yes. There are many libraries as well as commercial exploiters of
works that make it impossible for me to access works that I wish to study,
read or enjoy. For some reason all these institutes have been able to gain
a position in which that are able to prevent the authors from receiving the
income that I wish to pay them.
c) - yes. As indicated above, these institutes have complicated the
situation in such a way that the book I was referring to, is not available
through them. The disadvantage that we, the as authors, do not receive an
income from this book is even overshadowed by the fact that we do not reach
the audience that we wish to reach, because of this financial complication
that the institutes are not able to solve.

33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

By implementing the URR.


34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions  should
be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]

35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
Implementation of the URR. In the URR system a library  or  any  'reseller'
would ne added to the database of beneficiaries of  the  product,  and  the
product would receive a new productcode consequently.  Anybody  wishing  to
read, study or enjoy the product would pay according to use (fair use: read
a citation, pay next to nothing. use: pay a fee)  After  the  sale  of  the
product, the owner is registered as such, and can enter the  product  code,
for instance, as a reference (to the inspirational work) in the book the he
or she is writing.  The  reference  in  the  list  of  literature  will  be
automatic. This connects the original work to the buyers of the  new  work,
and for readers of the derived work it  becomes  easy  to  connect  to  all
inspirational authors. If  the  second  book  uses  more  than  'fair  use'
citations,  then  part  of  the  authorship  will  be  registered  to   the
inspirational work.

3. E - lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and  libraries   are
currently experimenting with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to  negotiate  agreements  to  enable  the  electronic
lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or other  materials
held in your collection?

b) [In particular if you are an end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books  or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending), including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?
c)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

X YES - Please explain with specific examples
This issue of 'lending' does not regard libraries  only  and  the  possible
problems must be solved as a part of a wider practice.  In  fact  'lending'
has become an illusion since content is no longer the same as  the  carrier
of the information. Payment (or: rent) of the carrier must not be  confused
with payment (for consumption or for new creation)  for  the  content.  And
payment of the content must not be confused with the communication  between
a professional author and consumer. In a specific 'product', a carrier  and
content are combined into a product-code. In  the  case  a  consumer  takes
content from the carrier and starts dealing the content alone, or  combined
with a new carrier, the new product gets a new codeiv.  Authorisation  from
the authors is needed, but can be automatic, when the authors have

foreseen this possibility. If the authors do not agree, an URR-code to  the
product is not granted, and  the  product  becomes  illegal.  (Compare  for
instance bootleg recordings of a concert).

37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
In the end, the only problem that will remain is the existence of 'illegal'
(counterfeit) products. These are  registered  products  from  professional
users, without an accepted URR- code that shows ownership  and  provenance.
Possession and/or trading of such an illegal product must be dealt with  in
the same way as with all such products (i.e. Counterfeit money).

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and  the
previous one (n° 2).

38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:]  What  differences  do
you see in the management of physical  and  online  collections,  including
providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?

[Open question]

39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do  you  see
between libraries ' traditional activities such as on-premises consultation
or public lending and activities  such  as  off-  premises  (online,  at  a
distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?
As indicated above, there is no difference, aside  from  the  confusion  of
content  and  carrier  as   well   as   the   non-existence   of   a   good
author/product/consumer identification system as the URR. These  have  lead
to the fact that  my  works  (texts  and  theatrical  text,  are  virtually
impossible to get hold of. This is not only the problem of  the  libraries,
but also the problem of the producers  (editors,  theatre  companies)  that
have published my work.

4. Mass digitisation
The term "mass digitisation" is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum  of
Understanding (MoU) on  key  principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in
the normal channels of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors  and
publishers on the other[41].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such  licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting
society or  the  recognition  of  an  "extended  effect"  to  the  licences
granted)[42].


40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to
engage  in  mass  digitisation  projects,  a  right  holder,  a  collective
management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your  country  to  enact
legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements
concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have  a  cross-border
effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

X YES - Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
Mass digitation as referred to here needs to be reorganized  in  the  sense
that digitisation of each work will be done according to  the  URR  system:
each work needs to aquire it's own unique ID  and  corresponding  table  of
Unique author's ID's. When digitizing, the unique ID needs to be  digitally
embedded in the work. Its table of authors needs  to  be  filled,  possibly
through a wiki-like system. Legislation needs to safeguard  the  obligation
to not create any digitized copy without this system embedded.

41. Would it be necessary  to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
agreed for  other  types  of  content  (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
collections, broadcasters' archives)?

X YES - Please explain
The system needs to be a URR, there should be no need for a  difference  in
approach between the digitation of a ballet-performance and  a  work  of  a
medieval poet.

□ NO - Please explain

B. Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC[43]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation  at
Member States level. The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some
argue that the law should provide for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.

42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use  works  or
other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including  across
borders?


(b) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
X YES - Please explain
One of my  plays  was  taken  (without  my  knowledge  or  permission)  for
performances in Russia; mainly in schools. I was supposed to be happy about
this.
□ NO

43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
The use of content in education is no different than in  the  open  market.
Once there is a possibility for automatic micro-payment,  as  a  result  of
some transfer of content, the problem of payment is inherently solved.  One
needs to realize that the individual user will need to pay relatively small
amounts, not comparable to the buying of school-books as  it  used  to  be.
Whether these costs will be paid for by the educational institute or by the
students can be decided by the users. Each use of (part  of)  a  work  will
receive it's own new product ID that can be  subject  to  approval  by  the
original owners.

C. Research
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to choose whether  to  implement
in their national laws a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-commercial
scientific research. The open  formulation  of  this  (optional)  provision
allows for rather different implementations at Member States level.

47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use  works  or
other subject  matter  in  the  context  of  research  projects/activities,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

D. Disabilities
                 48
Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception/limitation for  the  benefit
of people with a  disability.  The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level. At EU  and  international  level  projects  have  been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works  published  in
special formats and facilitating their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [44]
The Marrakesh Treaty[45] has been adopted to facilitate access to published
works for persons who are blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows
organisations for the blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired  persons   without   the
authorisation of the rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50. (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
organisation representing persons with disabilities:] Have you  experienced
problems with accessibility to content, including across  borders,  arising
from Member States' implementation of this exception?
b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for  persons
with    disabilities:]    Have    you     experienced     problems     when
distributing/communicating works published in special  formats  across  the
EU?
c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced  specific
problems resulting  from  the  application  of  limitations  or  exceptions
allowing for the distribution/communication of works published  in  special
formats, including across borders?

E. Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[46] are different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to  e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is made
of the relevant texts and data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or
other subject matter, it is necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whether the main problems arising in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain  "access"  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and  data
mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
                                         52
publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe" . In the context of these
discussions, other stakeholders argued that no additional  licences  should
be required to mine material to which access has been  provided  through  a
subscription agreement and considered that a specific  exception  for  text
and  data  mining  should  be  introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of  a
distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying  to
use text or data mining methods, including across borders?
b) [In particular if you are  a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services based  on  text  or
data mining methods, including across borders?
c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced  specific
problems resulting from the use of text and  data  mining  in  relation  to
copyright protected content, including across borders?

F. User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and
distribute content at little to no financial cost. As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the making  of
so-called "user-generated content". While users can create totally original
content, they can also take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and
    53
blogs . User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-
existing  works  even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"  work  does  not
necessarily require a creative effort
and results from  merely  adding,  subtracting  or  associating  some  pre-
existing content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity  is
not "new" as such. However, the development of social networking and social
media sites that enable users to share content widely  has  vastly  changed
the scale of such activities and increased the  potential  economic  impact
for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the
preserve  of  a  technically  and  artistically  adept  elite.   With   the
possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to all, at no
cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to fundamental rights  such
the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and  the
users generating the content. In any event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users  were
pledged by rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
"Licences for Europe" discussions[47].

58. (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject
matter to  disseminate  new  content  on  the  Internet,  including  across
borders?
b) [In particular if you are  a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?

 IV. Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[48]. Levies are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a  view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making
copies for their private use) or through use  of  certain  technique  (i.e.
reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the  question  arises
as to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers' licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies
to certain types of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope  and
application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[49]  in  the
digital environment?
□ YES - Please explain

□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

65. Should digital copies made by end users for  private  purposes  in  the
context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where  the
harm  to  the  rightholder  is  minimal,  be  subject  to  private  copying
levies?[50]
□ YES - Please explain □ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application  to  online
services (e.g. services based on cloud computing  allowing,  for  instance,
users to have copies on  different  devices)  impact  the  development  and
functioning of new business  models  on  the  one  hand  and  rightholders'
revenue on the other?
[Open question]

67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on  the  invoices
for products subject to levies?[51]
□ YES - Please explain

□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that  context,  not
all Member States have ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of  undue
payments[52].

68. Have you experienced  a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or
other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?


□ YES - Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the  percentage
of the undue payments. Please also indicate how a priori  exemption  and/or
ex post reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.

□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons  other
than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying?  Do
any of those transactions result  in  undue  payments?  Please  explain  in
detail the example you provide (type  of  products,  type  of  transaction,
stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]

70. Where such undue payments arise,  what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
affect?  To  what  extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or   ex   post
reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy  the
situation?
[Open question]

71. If you have identified specific problems with the  current  functioning
of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]

  V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors  or
performers to producers[53] or determining who the owner of the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[54]. This is an area that has been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.


Concerns continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72. [In particular if you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to  ensure  that  you  receive  an
adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]

73. Is there a need to act at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?
□ YES - Please explain

□ NO - Please explain why

□ NO OPINION

74. If you consider that the current rules are not  effective,  what  would
you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]

 VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE[55] provides for a harmonised framework for the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright  and
related rights. The Commission has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[56].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in
case of infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen
respect for

copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial  purpose[57].
One means to do this could be to clarify the role of intermediaries in  the
IP infrastructure[58]. At the same time, there could  be  clarification  of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for  private
users.

75. Should the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
efficient for  infringements  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
purpose?
X-YES - Please explain
As said before, the URR needs to be supported  by  legislation,  and  after
that the matter should be dealt with by bodies that are in  place  -  these
however  can  be  simplified.  The  most   essential   however,   is   that
'copyrights', or 'author's rights' should no longer be seen as just  a  fee
for consumption. The Author's rights and the Consumer ID are the basics for
a database that will facilitate a network between  authors  and  consumers,
with producers and facilitating institutions as nodes. This will  create  a
Niche-to-Niche market that allows future products  to  find  customers  and
customer's wishes that can be fulfilled on a pro-active base.

□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow  for
sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as   Internet   service
providers, advertising brokers,  payment  service  providers,  domain  name
registrars, etc.) in  inhibiting  online  copyright  infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries?
Not. Implementation of URR. Once the contact between authors and  Consumers
is direct and open, there will no longer be any objection to intermediaries
that transfer any content to new carriers, since the involvement  of  these
intermediaries is recognised in a new product ID, or it is not  allowed  by
withholding the product ID. ISP's,  for  instance  will  start  to  receive
income directly from the stream of  copyright-transfers,  since  they  will
become part of recipients in the Product-ID's. (they are co-'author' of the
internet-versions).

77. Does the current civil  enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
balance is achieved between the right to have one's copyright respected and
other rights such as  the  protection  ofprivate  life  and  protection  of
personal data?
□ YES - Please explain

X NO - Please explain


 The internet was never developed with it's current existence in  mind,  and
 therefore it is completely inadequate as to take care  of  Copyrights,  and
 protection of private life and data. These are aspects that have to  become
 built-in in a new network-principle that is based  on  the  protection  and
 facilitation of transfer of professional content.
 □ NO OPINION

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
 The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been  present  in
 the copyright debate for quite some time now,  although  views  as  to  the
 merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A  unified  EU
 Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU
 and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of
 a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner  in  which  a
 truly Single Market for content protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
 while others believe that the same objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
 establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for  a  certain
 degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States' legal systems.

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU  Copyright  Title,
 as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions
 to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 X YES.

79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the  EU?
 Does the current level of difference among  the  Member  State  legislation
 mean that this is a longer term project?
 YES - without a doubt. However; the  system  should  from  it's  conception
 allow communities of Authors and consumers from outside the  EU  entry  and
 participation. Participation will be allowed by each network that  combines
 Athors, products and consumers by unique ID's. Authorship and  consumership
 are by nature global aspects when it comes to the transfer of content.

VIII. Other issues

 The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the
 most important matters relating to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
 copyright. Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
 appreciate if you could bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
 properly addressed in the future.

[7]   This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on  several
occasions.
[8]   Proposal for a Directive  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the
Council of 11 July 2012 on collective management of copyright  and  related
rights and multi-territorial licensing  of  rights  in  musical  works  for
online uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
[9]   Collective Management Organisations play a significant  role  in  the
management of online rights for musical works in contrast to the  situation
where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film  or
record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

[13] For possible long  term  measures  such  as  the  establishment  of  a
European Copyright Code (establishing a single title) see  section  VII  of
this consultation document.
[14]  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
22 May 2001 on the  harmonisation  of  certain  aspects  of  copyright  and
related rights in the information society.
[15]  Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs.
[16]  Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.
[17]  Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of
so-called "neighbouring rights" in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast. Authors'  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a "work" or "works", while content protected by neighbouring
rights is referred to as "other subject matter".
[18]  The right to "authorise or prohibit direct or indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part"
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[19]  The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public "on demand" (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[20]  See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L'Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach, Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[21]  The objective of implementing a "country of  origin"  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[22]  Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International)  and  C-
279/13 (C More entertainment).
[23]  Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd). See
also http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC 2011 0202
PressSummary.pdf.
[24]  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
[25]  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a secondhand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale. While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with the  right  holder's
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.  It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[26]  For example,  it  does  not  affect  "domestic"  works  -  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[27]  On the basis of Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[28]  E.g. the International Standard Recording  Code  (ISRC)  is  used  to
identifγ recordings, the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is  used
to identifγ books.

the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
[37]  Only the exception established in the recent Orphan  Works  Directive
(a mandatory exception to copyright and related rights in  the  case  where
the rightholders are not known or cannot  be  located)  has  been  given  a
crossborder effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work  -
for instance a novel - is considered an orphan work in a Member State, that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.

effects of the MoU. The French act  (LOI  n°  2012-287  du  1er  mars  2012
relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle)
foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher in  question
opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are not  members
of the collecting society.
