   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

John  Wiley  &  Sons  (“Wiley”)  is  pleased  to  respond  to   the   Public
Consultation on the Review of EU Copyright Rules.

Founded in 1807, Wiley is North America’s oldest independent publisher, and
has a distinguished history as a literary, scientific, technical, medical,
and scholarly publisher, serving researchers and practitioners around the
world.  Wiley’s European operations include a number of offices, notably in
Weinheim and Berlin in Germany, Copenhagen in Denmark, and Chichester and
Oxford in the United Kingdom, with  a European distribution centre based in
Bognor Regis. We are a significant local employer in these locations.
Today, we employ approximately 1,600 staff in Europe and over 4,800
globally.

We are one of the world’s foremost academic and professional publishers. We
publish over 1,600 scholarly peer-reviewed journals, and our online service
Wiley Online Library (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/) provides electronic
access to more than six million articles across these journals. Global
Research, Wiley’s scientific, technical, medical and scholarly publishing
division, is also the world’s largest society publisher, working in
partnership with over 800 learned and scholarly and professional societies
and organisations which represent millions of members globally. Partners
include the Cochrane Collaboration, for which we publish The Cochrane
Library; the British Ecological Society, for which we publish five
journals; EMBO (four journals) the British Psychological Society (11
journals), and several European federations, including FEBS (Federation of
European Biochemical Societies), FEMS (Federation of European
Microbiological Societies), and FENS (Federation of European Neuroscience
Societies). Many of the societies we and other publishers partner with
depend to a significant extent on the revenues generated by publishers to
support activities which benefit the communities those societies serve and
the general societal good.

Global Research is one of Wiley’s three core businesses.  Our Professional
Development business serves professionals and consumers, producing books,
subscriptions content, and information services in all media in subject
areas including business, technology, architecture, psychology, education,
and , health.  Our Global Education business serves undergraduate, graduate
and advanced placement students and lifelong learners, publishing
educational materials in all media, notably through WileyPLUS, our
integrated online suite of teaching and learning resources.

Wiley supports and endorses the submissions made by our industry
associations on the consultation, notably the submissions from the UK
Publishers Association (“PA”), and the International Association of
Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers (“STM”).

In general, we limit our submission to the questions most relevant to
publishing.




  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)

   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES


€ ✔ NO


€ NO OPINION





   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


As a global publisher, Wiley acquires and licenses rights on a global  basis
rather than on a territorial basis.  This is  the  norm  in  the  publishing
sector and allows us  to  provide  access  to  publications  across  borders
without restriction, whether  using  proprietary  online  services  such  as
Wiley Online Library, or by partnering with bookstores, online retailers  or
other distribution partners.  A registered user  of  Wiley  Online  Library,
for example, can  access  the  service  by  logging  on  from  any  location
worldwide and will  encounter  the  same  user  experience.  As  rights  are
acquired broadly from authors and licensors, and generally on  an  exclusive
basis, we are also able to license translation and other rights on a  global
basis without territorial or other restriction so that the  work  can  reach
its full potential. We  also  license  collective  management  organisations
(“CMO”s) to administer rights  for  secondary  uses  across  borders,  using
established models of CMO co-operation. Wiley publishes books in  print  and
electronic fromat in addition to  over 1600 journals,  databases,  reference
works and other products.





   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


We have not identified problems.





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


€ YES


€ ✔ NO


€ NO OPINION





   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ YES


€ ✔ NO


€ NO OPINION





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES


€✔  NO  –Wiley  has  not  encountered  any  difficulties  with  cross-border
portability  or  access  in  the  publishing  environment.  Global/   multi-
territory market-led licensing is the  norm  in  academic  and  professional
publishing.


€ NO OPINION





Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ ✔ YES   We understand the ‘making available’ right as the broad  right  to
control the offering of copyright works online, whether or  not  such  works
are accessed and irrespective of the way in which such  works  are  accessed
and used.  In relation to cross border activities, rightsholders need to  be
able to rely on the law of the country in which protection is sought,  which
is an established conflict of law rule for copyright and other  intellectual
property rights and gives rightsholders protections which could  be  limited
under a country of origin rule. We continue to monitor CJEU  cases  in  this
area in  relation  to  Article  5(3)  of  the  Jurisdiction  Regulation  and
anticipate clarification by the courts following the reasoning  in  Pinckney
Mediatech.

€ NO

€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[23])?


€ YES


€ ✔ NO


€ NO OPINION





Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES


€ ✔ NO - We have not found this to be an issue in the publishing sector as
all required rights are generally granted to the publisher for commercial
exploitation.  This means that there is no practical distinction between
the reproduction right and the making available right for licensing
purposes.


€ NO OPINION





Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[24]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[25] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€✔ YES –Put simply, if the hyperlink allows access  to  copyright  protected
work, then authorisation of the rightsholder should be obtained.   We  agree
with the Report and Opinion of  the  Association  Litteraire  et  Artistique
International (“ALAI”) that the making available right does not cover  links
that merely refer to a source from which a work may  be  accessed  but  does
cover links that enable members of the public to access  specific  protected
material.  There is no reason why hyperlinking should be excluded  from  the
requirement of consent or licensing for access to copyright works.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES


€✔ NO – Temporary reproduction of copyright protected works should not  need
further authorisation if the work itself is lawfully accessed.  This  should
not mean that any distinction is drawn between downloading and streaming  in
terms of licensing requirements.  There is no reason for streaming of  works
to be treated differently from downloading of works – both are varieties  of
on demand services protected by copyright.


€ NO OPINION





Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[26].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[27].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


€ YES –


€ ✔ NO


€ NO OPINION


  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.


Rightsholders must be able to set licence terms when making works  available
to the  public,  including  the  right  to  prevent  re-sale  of  previously
purchased  digital  content,  such  as  e-books.  The  introduction  of  the
principle of exhaustion of rights to the right of distribution online  would
severely  impact  the  viability  of  the  publishing  sector   and   stifle
innovation, particularly experimentation in low cost  temporary  access  and
rental models, aimed at providing readers with  choice,  convenience  and  a
compelling value proposition.  The characteristics of the used  book  market
and the used e-book market are very different,  not  least  because  e-books
can be easily copied and do not deteriorate.   The  ability  to  re-sell  or
transfer an e-book or other digital content should be subject  to  licensing
terms by the  rightsholder  based  on  the  value  of  that  right  and  its
potential impact on the primary market, with models  ranging  from  complete
buy out of rights  to  a  temporary  or  otherwise  restricted  licence.  An
example of the evolution and flexibility of licensing  models  can  be  seen
with the adoption of  Creative  Commons  licences  in  open  access  journal
publishing. Creative Commons offers a range  of  licences  from  those  that
restrict commercial use and creation of derivatives such as the CC  BY-NC-ND
to the more liberal CC BY that permits the user  to  use  the  work  freely,
including for re-sale or other commercial  exploitation.   Importantly,  the
freedom of choice of the rightsholder is paramount.


It is also important to note that  the  concept  of  ‘owning’  purchased  or
downloaded content is difficult to reconcile with the  new  and  interactive
products  made  possible  by   technology.    Increasingly,   there   is   a
differentiation between ‘flat’ content and enhanced  or  functional  content
and services.  In our Global Education  business,  for  example,  models  of
learning are being developed and deliverd in  different  ways  to  meet  the
individual needs of the  learner.  Course  solutions  can  include  embedded
media assets, assessment  capability,  adapted  learning  and  collaboration
tools.   These  services  are  customised  to  particular  courses  and  are
typically purchased or funded at institutional level. It would be of  little
value to ‘own’ a  version  of  a  work  which  is  essentially  dynamic  and
interactive by design.


We consider that the  reasoning  in  Capitol  v  ReDigi  (2013)  in  the  US
District Court for the Southern District of New York is correct in  limiting
the first sale docrine to material items  and  prohibiting  it  for  digital
copies used under licence.








Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[28]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[29].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€✔ YES - We are in favour of voluntary registration of copyright protected
works, provided that it is not a precondition for the protection and
exercise of rights and does not become a de facto formality.  Voluntary
registration systems are widely used in the publishing industry by CMOs and
other organisations and are essential to the management of rights and
licensing.  We also consider that a costs/benefits analysis would be
necessary before embarking upon an expensive, central register.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


If tied to existing systems and identifiers, e.g. DOI, ISBN, ORCID,  then  a
voluntary registration system could be streamlined and low  cost,  extending
the work of national initiatives, e.g. The Copyright Hub in the  UK,  across
Europe.  Searchability of  available  content  should  then  lead  to  wider
access and increased return on investment.





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


Cost and burden of registration, and potential for duplication  of  existing
initiatives.





  18. What incentives for registration by rightsholders could be envisaged?


Registration should be voluntary. Rightsholders in publishing are  generally
quick to take advantage of efficient systems that  enable  automated  rights
management and  licensing,  e.g.  the  Rightslink  service  offered  by  the
Copyright Clearance Center (“CCC”) in the US.





How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[30], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[31]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[32]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[33] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


The EU could usefully fund exploration of integration of existing
initiatives in Europe, the commitments arising from the Licences for Europe
stakeholder dialogue, and the development of interoperability standards.

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[34]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

€✔ YES – We consider that the current term of copyright provides a
reasonable balance for creators and consumers and does not need to be
either reduced or extended.  Ownership of copyright is in many cases the
most valuable asset held by creators and they should be entitled to own
such rights as a property right for themselves and their beneficiaries.
Orphan works legislation and the EU memorandum of understanding on out of
commerce works means that older works will continue to be enjoyed and
should not fall into disuse.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[35].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[36].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[37], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[38],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[39].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

€ YES


€✔ NO While it is true that there is  considerable  variability  between  MS
legislation deriving from the inherent flexibility in Article  5(3)  of  the
2001 Directive, this does not detract from our  capacity  to  sell  licences
across borders in the EU, and this variability  also  accommodates  cultural
differences and diversity in legal traditions between MS. We  doubt  that  a
single EU-level  framework  could  be  devised  to  take  account  of  these
variations and there  are  more  pressing  matters  related  to  stimulating
innovation and growth in our sector,  including  harmonisation  of  taxation
and effective enforcement.  We consider that a degree of flexibility  beween
MS, provided  that  all  exceptions  and  limitations  are  subject  to  the
essential backstop of the three step test.


€ NO OPINION


  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES.


€✔ NO Diversity is a necessary feature of a healthy market.  Licences  offer
more flexibility and a  swifter  response  to  evolving  market  needs  than
legislation. Exceptions need only be introduced to  reinforce  social  needs
not enabled by licensing, as a remedy for market failure, or  to  enable  an
orderly resolution of specific issues such as re-use of orphan  works.  From
this perspective, we see no case for making any of the  optional  exceptions
in Article 5(3) mandatory at EU level in the current  markets  in  which  we
operate.


€ NO OPINION






  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


We do not see a case for introducing  any  new  exceptions  for  usage  that
cannot be effectively resolved by  licensed  solutions,  either  primary  or
collective. A better strategy would be  to  fully  understand  how  existing
exceptions have been effectively implemented  without  impacting  negatively
on growth and innovation in the creative industries.


  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES


€✔ NO There is enough flexibility inherent in  existing  legislation  at  EU
level and this is  still  being  adapted  for  implementation  at  MS  level
(recently for example in Germany and the UK). To introduce more  flexibility
at this stage is only to invite legal uncertainty where little exists.


€ NO OPINION



  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market..

Even if it were possible  to  overhaul  the  European  acquis  to  introduce
something akin to the  US  concept  of  ‘fair  use’  criteria  to  apply  to
individual cases and disputes, we would be highly sceptical  of  the  effect
of such a concept  on  the  single  market  in  the  EU.  Fair  use  invites
litigation and brings legal uncertainty, only to  be  resolved  through  the
courts and this can take many years –  see  for  example  the  long  running
litigation  over  Google’s  unlicensed   scanning  of  copyright  works   in
libraries. Smaller organisations are daunted and excluded by  the  potential
costs associated with such a resolution. The innate flexibility of fair  use
at EU level and its consequences  would  be  in  conflict  with  progressive
forces for harmonisation of licences and the application  of  exceptions  in
an orderly but diverse market.

  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES


€✔ NO - Any uncertainty can be dealt with by licences and  contracts,  which
provide  a  more  rapid  and  flexible  mechanism  than   harmonisation   of
exceptions through legislation. Much of the usage in our  sector  for  which
exceptions may apply as defined in Article 5(2), such as for  education  and
by libraries and archives, is largely confined within MS and so is  innately
territorial  in  nature.  Existing  and  evolving  solutions  and   services
delivered through primary and collective licences are already in place.


€ NO OPINION





  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

The complexity of such a provision that can  take  account  of  cross-border
usage within the network of EU MS is daunting, unnecessary and in  the  case
of usage via the Internet probably  impossible.  In  our  view  it  is  much
better to allow the current pragmatic marketplace to  evolve  solutions  for
rightsholder remuneration without imposing  unwanted  issues  deriving  from
cross-border exceptions.

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[40] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[41].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[42].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.


  28. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
      preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your
      collection?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

€ YES.


€✔ NO - We offer primary and collective licences to institutions wanting  to
use our publications and we have in place solutions  that  ensure  effective
long-term  archiving  of  our  content.  We  have  also  invested   in   the
digitisation of historical (pre-digital) content for many  of  our  journals
in order to preserve and improve access to the archive.


€ NO OPINION




29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
We already co-operate with  public-private  partnerships  such  CLOCKSS  and
Portico, and with the  national  and  heritage  libraries  operating  legal
deposit schemes. We do not see any problems  in  this  area  still  needing
resolution in relation to our publications.


  30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

We do not believe that further legislative solutions are needed at EU  level
for product in our sector.

  31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

As indicated above we are  already  involved  with  a  number  of  voluntary
schemes.




Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

We have negotiated agreements  with numerous  libraries, consortia and
other institutions in the EU for online access to our publications,
including journals and o-books. These agreements provide online access for
authorised users  of these institutions via their secure networks.
Authorised users typically include employees, faculty, contractors and
students, including distance learners, and authorised users are able to
access licensed material remotely and across borders.  In addition, members
of societies affiliated to journals can access the content in those
journals through society websites by trusted proxy access. We also offer
national licences for certain products, such as The Cochrane Library, if
national funding is available to purchase access for all individuals
located in a territory, as identified by IP address.  All users may use
licensed content in accordance with liberal licence terms, which permit
downloading amd storage for personal use and for scholarly, scientific,
educational and professional purposes.  Users may also transmit individual
chapters and articles to colleagues for their personal use.    For those
not affiliated to an institution, there is walk-in access to dedicated
terminals in libraries (including public libraries in the UK) and content
may be purchased or rented using pay per view mechanisms, which are
available online. Access is also available via document delivery services
operated by national libraries such as The British Library and Subito
(Germany). Our publications are available through such services, sometimes
involving a collective licence from an RRO.  No lience is required to view
and download atstracts summarising the methods and results of research
papers, which are freely available in the Wiley Online Library.


  33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Problems of access are best resolved through multi-stakeholder dialogue, as
has frequently been the case with the national libraries.



  34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

We see no case for introducing an  exception  to  enable  public  access  to
library collections of copyright material  via  the  Internet.  Open  access
solutions are evolving rapidly for publicly funded and other  research,  and
licensed solutions for access to copyright  material  sold  on  subscription
are developing organically in response  to  demand  and  the  capability  of
digital technology. The imposition of  legislative  solutions  could  stifle
innovation in the private sector, nullify public-private  partnerships,  and
jeopardise the security of investment in online content..

  35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

We believe  that  licensed  solutions  are  available  within  the  existing
legislative framework.




E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

€ YES


€✔ NO - Much  of  our  catalogue  is  available  via  university  and  other
institutional libraries, and we do not enter into  agreements  that  involve
remote lending via downloading or streaming. Public  libraries  represent  a
small proportion of our market by value, and we  approach  requests  for  e-
lending on a case by case basis, for reasons of security  and  the  capacity
to undermine our primary market, in ways that simply do  not  apply  to  the
lending of printed books.


€ NO OPINION


  37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

Considerable stakeholder dialogue will be needed to resolve  effectively  if
at all  the  conflicting  missions  of  publishers  wanting  to  sell  their
product, intermediaries such as booksellers wanting to be part of the  value
chain, and libraries wanting to service their users. Resolutions  have  been
tried via such dialogue in certain member states (such  as  the  UK)  and  a
policy of looking for licensed solutions and  sharing  best  practice  would
seem to be the best way forward.


The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

  38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences  do
      you  see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,
      including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you
      encountered?

[Not applicable to us]

  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?

On-premises consultation of printed copies owned  by  the  library  or  lent
individually present publishers with no problems. We also  actively  support
access via dedicated terminals on library premises, for example  the  Access
to Research initiative via the public libraries in the UK that was  launched
on 3rd February 2014. Online access to material  available  on  subscription
via secure networks such as university libraries is  also  fully  supported.
Solutions for public access online  to  open  versions  of  publicly  funded
research articles are being developed, for example the CHORUS initiative  in
the US. Fully open access  business  models  are  now  common  and  evolving
rapidly. We do however harbour concerns about  e-lending  via  downloads  by
libraries, especially public libraries.  Issues  of  security  are  critical
since digital copies  remain  perfect  copies  and  are  easily  transmitted
through unauthorised channels. Models for secure e-lending exist and  pilots
are in hand but publishers still harbour legitimate  concerns  about  unfair
competition, clearly demonstrated by case studies such as the initiative  in
Denmark. It would appear if e-lending is to progress that  streaming  models
may be more appropriate than downloading.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[43].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[44].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?


€✔ YES  - Legislation to enable extended collective licensing is in its
final form in the UK and undergoing technical consultation. When passed,
this will potentially enable mass digitisation projects via collective
licences and opt-in schemes from the collecting societies (CMOs),  although
we are not aware that the UK institutions such as The British Library yet
have the necessary funding needed to progress such projects and the
stakeholders are yet to come together to devise specific schemes such as
those already implemented in France and Germany.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





  41. Would it be necessary to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
      agreed for other types of content (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
      collections, broadcasters’ archives)?


€ [Not applicable]





Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[45]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

€ YES.


€✔ NO - Education is generally a compliant sector  that  respects  copyright
and the copyright rules. Our  publications  are  fully  available  via  both
primary licences and for onward re-use via collective licences.


€ NO OPINION


  43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

We do not experience problems with our publications being used for
illustration for teaching.



  44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to  facilitate  the  use  of
      content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
      they?

This will depend on the medium used for illustration. Until recently this
has for the most part involved photocopying from books and this generally
is enabled by well-established secondary licensing schemes available from
RROs such as the CLA in the UK. We are not aware of any problems with the
operation of such schemes, which commonly extend to the scanning of printed
material for use on whiteboards and in course packs. Born-digital material
is by definition available for illustration, and access will depend on
licence agreements. Vast quantities of teaching material are available in
digital form, both commercially and via open access. Mechanisms include
streaming services, downloads to institutional caches, and online access
via the Internet. Several MS have the benefit of collaborative opt-in
schemes at school level that make significant quantities of copyright
material available via single portals with single sign-on. We are aware of
such schemes in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Denmark, Italy
and Spain, although not yet in the UK. At higher education level
innovations are well developed to make commercial e-textbooks from a wide
range of publishers available to both students and faculty via platforms
such as CourseSmart and Vital Source. Collaborative multi-publisher
platforms have also been developed in the Netherlands and Germany.



  45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under what conditions?


We do not believe that a legislative solution is  needed.  Primary  business
models backed up by secondary licensing schemes available from RROs  provide
effective, and evolving  solutions.  To  introduce  legislation  would  only
serve to inhibit market developments and stifle innovation.


  46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

We believe that the Commission and MS should  encourage  licensed  solutions
wherever  possible.   Wide   availability   of   professionally   developed
educational material, fit for purpose  and  tailored  to  local  needs,  is
absolutely  vital  for  the  effective  delivery  of  a  sound  educational
experience. To impose  solutions  on  a  well-functioning  organic  market,
especially at EU level, is likely to lead only to  unintended  consequences
and a retreat by private sector investors.





Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

  47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research
      projects/activities, including across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

€ YES


€✔ NO - Wiley is a global leader in the publication and worldwide
dissemination of primary research outputs, principally through scholarly
journals. We operate a wide variety of licenced arrangements directly with
libraries and other institutions, and we are progressively introducing open
access models as well. We also collaborate with initiatives that aim to
extend access such as Research for Life (developing countries), Access to
Research (UK public libraries), and CHORUS (public access in the US). We
are not aware of problems resulting from the application of exceptions for
research and private study and multiple copying needs are catered for
either by our primary licences or by secondary licences issued by RROs to
enable usage such as for course packs. There is some concern about the use
of published content in private sharing groups in commercial scientific
social media sites but this is primarily an enforcement education matters.



€ NO OPINION




  48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Licensed solutions deriving from collaboration and dialogue will  always  be
the best option.


  49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate  the  use  of
      content for research purposes? How successful are they?

Beyond the normal functioning of the  established  library  market  and  the
growth of open access publishing, presumably.  Mechanisms  in  the  UK  will
include  the  intended  adoption  of  the  exception  for  making  digitised
collections available  through  library  terminals,  and  the  collaborative
Access to Research initiative  that   launched  on  3  February  2013.  This
involves publishers opting in their journals  repertoire  to  a  free-to-use
licence via the Publishers Licensing Society that  will  then  be  available
from a common platform via dedicated  terminals  in  the  public  libraries.
The  journal  ecosystem  is  advanced,  and  research   acknowledges   other
published research in a structured (industry  standard)  way,  allowing  for
citing, linking and other forms of acknowledgement which  directs  users  to
the corpus of available evidence. Aggregators such as ISI  and  PubMed  also
play a role in providing gateways to research and facilitating discovery.


Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [48].

The Marrakesh Treaty[49] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?



(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?

€ YES.


€✔ NO - We are  fully  supportive  of  initiatives  to  enhance  access  for
persons with disabilities that do not  undermine  market  norms.  We  expect
that exceptions introduced into territorial legislation  in  line  with  the
WIPO Marrakesh Treaty will have a significant impact in the medium term.


€ NO OPINION




  51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

We are fully supportive of the ETIN and TIGAR initiatives aiming to enhance
delivery of accessible versions across borders.  The impact of such
initiatives will however depend on demand for material beyond any
territorial associations and this may be limited.



  52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility
      to content? How successful are they?

The real answer to the accessibility question resides in technology, not
legislation, and in collaboration between the players in the supply chain.
E-Books with built-in accessibility features have already had a major
impact on the availability of accessible editions. The e-Pub standard as it
is progressively adopted will move matters forward even further. These are
solutions available through the open market, and technology, applied
collaboratively, will only improve matters quite rapidly over time.





Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[50] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[51].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when
      trying to use text or data mining methods, including across borders?

(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services  based  on  text  or
data mining methods, including across borders?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

€✔ NO - Wiley is keen to encourage innovative uses of the  content  that  we
publish, and we are happy to support text and data mining  (TDM)  activities
carried out under licence  by  bona  fide   researchers.  Examples  of  this
include licences agreed  with  the  Human  Genome  Browser  project  at  the
University of California,  Santa  Cruz,  and  with  the  European  Molecular
Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg. In fact, licensing solutions  are  already
in place for all  types  of  commercial  and  non-commercial  TDM  activity,
whether offered directly by rights-holders,  or  through  collective  rights
management organisations, such as the Copyright Clearance Center.  Wiley  is
a signatory to the STM Declaration on Text and Data Mining  (http://www.stm-
assoc.org/2013_11_11_Text_and_Data_Mining_Declaration.pdf),  which   commits
publishers  to  facilitating  non-commercial  text  and   data   mining   on
subscribed content in the EU, and to  developing  simplified  licensing  and
access schemes, such as  CrossRef’s  Prospect  service,  which  will  enable
researchers to access content from publishers using a straightforward click-
through licensing mechanism.


The major barrier to enabling TDM of copyright-protected content is not  the
current European copyright framework; rather, it is  the  technological  and
security questions  around  content  access  and  management  by  end-users.
Licensing provides rightsholders and end-users with certainty  around  these
issues, and enables TDM solutions that meet the needs of both parties.





€ NO


€ NO OPINION


  54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Wiley, in collaboration with other industry partners and  user  communities,
is engaged  in  developing  market-based  solutions  to  enable  TDM.  Wiley
believes that text and data mining is best managed through licensing  rather
than legislative  change,  as  licences  offer  both  parties  much  greater
certainty and security around issues such  as  the  impact  of  crawling  on
publisher  platforms,  the  potential  for  unauthorised  redistribution  of
content, or the creation of substitute products  and  services  from  copied
content. Legislation is likely to discourage innovation in the market,  will
offer little if any certainty to users wishing to  access  content  for  TDM
purposes, and will not solve any of the significant technology and  security
issues that need to be addressed in this context.


  55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?

As outlined in #54 above, Wiley believes  that text and data mining is  best
managed through licensing rather than legislative solutions. Legislation  is
likely to discourage innovation in the market,  will  offer  little  if  any
certainty to users wishing to access content for TDM purposes, and will  not
solve any of the significant technology and security issues that need to  be
addressed in this context.

  56. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

Market-based solutions  developed  in  collaboration  with  all  stakeholder
groups are essential to enable useful & successful TDM in the  EU  context.
Wiley has demonstrated willingness to work with all interested  parties  to
develop multi-stakeholder solutions, and will continue to explore how  best
we can meet market needs for TDM in a way  that  protects  the  content  we
publish, while enabling innovation

  57. Are there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
      barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

See our comments in #53 above regarding technology and security issues
concerning TDM, which are much more significant barriers than copyright
issues.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[52]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[53].


  58. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
      experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing  works  or  other
      subject matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
      across borders?


(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?


(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?


€ YES


€✔ NO - Unauthorised modification of published content has not to date  been
 a major problem for us, although the problems of  piracy  and  unauthorised
copying,  distribution  and  communication  remain  significant.     It   is
important that social media sites, including scientific social meadia  sites
such as Mendeley and academia.edu, observe the  basic  rules  of  copyright.
The STM industry has an established system for clearing permissions  between
publishers. We await with interest the development of the UK Copyright  Hub,
which we expect will enable ready clearance of permissions by those  wanting
to exploit content for onward use.  There  are  now  established  mechanisms
for creators to consent to use of their content for  a  range  of  different
purposes, using Creative Commons and similar licences,  which  set  out  the
terms of use in  machine  and  human  readable  code,  and  do  not  require
individual licensing arrangements.

  61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


Our industry has a well-established system for clearing  permission.  Beyond
that many STM publishers make their repertoire  available  through  the  CCC
Rightslink online service for clearing permissions and  remunerating  rights
holders. We expect that the UK Copyright Hub will also  make  a  significant
contribution as a service provider in this respect.





  62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?

We  do  not  believe  that  a  legislative  solution  is  either  needed  or
appropriate in this respect.

  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

Given the complexity of  usage  and  the  rapidly  evolving  nature  of  the
technology that enables these applications, a  licensing  solution  is  the
only sensible option. Legislation would be too limiting.

  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[54]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[55][56].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[57]  in
      the digital environment?

€ YES


€✔ NO - We are happy to support the current licensing framework  set  up  by
the RROs in Europe to organise an orderly market  for  reprographic  copying
and as a means to compensate rights holders for secondary usage.   We  would
prefer to see licences rather than levies as the means to compensate  rights
holders for private copying.


€ NO OPINION


  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[58]

€ YES


€ NO


€ ✔ NO OPINION


  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

We  believe  that  compensation   for   rights   holders   in   our   sector
(professional,  scholarly  and  academic  publishing)  should  be  based  on
licences not levies. Licences, effectively devised and based on user  needs,
can be adapted to changing circumstance. Levies by comparison  are  a  blunt
instrument open to dispute. We are particularly unclear on  what  basis  the
levies concept, developed to compensate rights holders for  private  copying
on multiple personal devices, could be applied to cloud computing.




  67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
      for products subject to levies?[59]

€✔ YES - Although we are not supportive of extending the levy  system,  this
development would be helpful providing that it is  made  clear  that  levies
are designed only to compensate rights holders for private copying.  Copying
for commercial purposes, if not covered by the primary licence,  requires  a
licence from an RRO.

€ NO OPINION





Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[60].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

€ YES


€ NO


€✔ NO OPINION


  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

[No response].


  70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
      affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
      reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
      the situation?

[No response]


  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[61] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[62]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

We believe in open markets and open competition between  publishers  on  the
basis of which authors can choose where to publish and  in  whom  to  invest
their intellectual property rights. Authors and publishers  should  be  left
to enter into contracts for the exploitation of  their  works  according  to
market conditions. We do not see a role for legislation, especially  not  at
EU level.

  73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?

€ YES


€✔ NO - The rapidly evolving  digital  environment  needs  market  solutions
based on contracts and licences, not regulatory legislation. We see no  role
for collective interventions, especially not at EU level.


€ NO OPINION


  74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what  would
      you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

[No response]




  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[63] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[64].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[65]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[66].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

€✔ YES - Internet service providers have  the  means  to  filter  infringing
content but generally choose not to do so. Instead the burden  is  put  onto
rightsholders not only to prove title but also to take  initial  action  for
‘notice and take down’. More proactive activity on  behalf  of  ISPs,  whose
business depends on the transmission of copyright content,  would  seem  not
only financially and legally but also morally  appropriate.  We  would  also
wish to see more  cooperation  from  the  ISPs  to  ensure  that  infringing
content subject to NTD stays down and does not reappear on another site.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION


  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

Clearly not.  ISPs have been reluctant to  play  their  part  in  combatting
infringing content on their networks in  a  pro-active  way.  Under  current
legislation there is little incentive for them to do so.


  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

€ YES


€✔ NO - We  believe  that  the  current  balance  tilts  in  favour  of  the
infringers. We do not understand why privacy rules should be allowed to  act
as a shield for infringing illegal activity. This would  not  apply  in  the
analogue world.   We support automatic fines and other penalties for  repeat
infringers,


€ NO OPINION





 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


€✔ NO


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

We are sceptical that the time, energy and resources needed to  establish  a
long term concept such as a single EU title, and the ramifications  of  that
for international treaties, should be a priority for  the  Commission  given
the other  challenges  surrounding  the  effective  working  of  the  single
market. There is still a long way to go on effective enforcement  of  rights
online, and the most effective resolution of market needs  in  recent  times
has  come  through  dialogue  leading  to  voluntary   licensed   solutions.
Differences in national laws have not proved  to  be  an  obstacle  to  pan-
European licensing in our sector. The Commission should  focus  on  enabling
stakeholders to come together to  evolve  voluntary  solutions  rather  than
seeking to introduce more legislation at EU level.




VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[27] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
