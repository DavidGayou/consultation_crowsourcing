My name: Simon Lundström
Member State: Sweden

I do not wish to be anonymous.

I am an end user consumer, and a translator, which makes me also a rights holder, as I hold
the copyrights to my translations.

I will FIRST state my ﬁrm standpoints, and my main suggestion and proposition when it comes
to copyright. My stance on this has taken years and years of thorough consideration and discu-
ssion to reach, and I wish to make it understood that this is not something I have thought up
yesterday. I will SECOND reply to the relevant questions in the consultation document.

My stances are two:
1) The length of current copyright is much too long. So long it’s laughable, ridiculous and a
shame to our society.
2) There is a high need for separation of copyright of WORK and of CONCEPT (deﬁnitions,
see below).

I will address them in order.
1) Copyright is too long
Currently, copyright is ”author’s lifetime + 70 years”, which is downright ridiculous, especially
since copyright currently also covers CONCEPT (see point 2).
It is well known that the reason copyright extended this much is due to a corporation lobbying,
and having ”lifetime + 70 years” is clearly not relevant for an individual. Lifetime+70 years is
basically only relevant for corporations, which is a clear sign that this long extent of copyright
is NOT from an overall perspective BUT only stems from corporation’s interests.

That alone is not a reason to change the current laws. HOWEVER, the reason we are protecting
copyright for the author is to give the author a decent chance to proﬁt off a highly copy-able
product that might have taken up to a lifetime to create. That the time span the copy-able pro-
duct is protected extends SEVENTY years after the individual’s death makes no sense at all.
There are very good reasons to have a copyright protection of copy-able products for a quite
long time, but extending to the author’s great-grandchildren is downright silly.

My suggestion for a more reasonable time to copyright protect a copy-able work would be 50
or 60 years after publication, or author’s lifetime+10 years, whatever comes ﬁrst. After that,
anyone should be free to publish the work in whatever form they deem reasonable.
2) Separating the copyrights for WORK and CONCEPT
I will ﬁrst deﬁne the terms:

With WORK I mean the actual work, for example:
If a book: the wordings, the illustrations (including logotype)
If a piece of art: the illustration, the sculpts
If a ﬁlm: the recording of the ﬁlm
If a song: the recording of the song
If a video game: the code behind the game
If a board game: the rule texts, the illustrations, etc

With CONCEPT I mean the set of ideas behind the work, for example:
If a book or ﬁlm: the title, the setting, the characters, the names of the characters, the storyline.
If a piece of art: the looks of the character, the colour scheme, etc.
If a song: the title, the notes, the melody, the lyrics
If a video game: The name, the characters, the exact way the game plays, the control scheme.
If a board game: The name, the exact game rules

My stance is that copyright for CONCEPT should be considerably shorter than that for WORK.
As per my proposition above, WORK should last for 50–60 years, or ”author’s lifetime+10”
years, whatever comes ﬁrst, whereas copyright for CONCEPT should last 20 or 25 at most.

It is important to note here that I do not think you should be allowed to falsify your identity.
You cannot pretend you are the original author.

Examples:
If we set the timespan for CONCEPTs to 25 years, it should be allowed to:
* By 2022, to write your own Harry Potter book, provided you do not use any part of Rowlings
WORK (including the logo), and make it absolutely clear that you are not J.K. Rowling.
* As of this year 2014, to make posters/puzzles/games based on Disney’s ”The Little Mermaid”,
as long as you do not use any part of Disney’s illustrations (including the logo), and make it
absolutely clear you are not the Disney corporation.

My reasons behind this stance:
Human culture is always built on the shoulders of those before us. While I think it’s very im-
portant that society creates a rule set where an author’s WORK is protected for a decent time, to
allow authors to spend their working time creating, I think it’s equally important that this rule
set allows others to further develop the CONCEPT, while not copying the WORK.

I also think that over-used protection of TITLES of works is acting negatively on the end-users,
focusing on the names of products instead of the AUTHOR/makers. A massive shortening of the
copyright for concepts will put a further spotlight on the AUTHOR, and thus the value of who
made it.

Standing on someone else’s concept is seen by some as un-creative, but this is a common mis-
conception based on that we are taking modern time copyrights as an axiom, when it is not. Few
people undervalue the work behind setting up a modern version of any of Shakespeare’s works,
and few undervalue the work Disney has done based on age-old concepts and stories. Using
someone else’s concept as a basis for your new work can be a source of inspiration that will
enhance creativity, and will further reﬁne art. As this, as noted above, also will put more focus
on the AUTHOR, the risk of confusion for end-users turns inﬁnitelysmall, as 20 or 25 years is
enough to establish who is the author of the CONCEPT.

It has been argued that a free market of competitive products within the same concept will risk
de-valuating the concept itself, and undermine the works. This, I see, is something that, while
being a risk, should not be regulated by law. I believe that a free competitive market, where
anyone would be able to make derivative works off 20 year old works, will instead have a po-
sitive effect on the overall quality of products, and an enhanced awareness among end users to
focus on the AUTHOR.

REPLIES TO THE CONSULTATION DOCUMENT QUESTIONS
Questions are in italics to separate from my replies.

1. Have you faced problems when trying to access online serviced in an EU Member Stat other
than the one in which you live.
YES. I live in Sweden, and when visiting Germany, I was unable to watch the TV show ”Äkta
människor” while there. I felt this was ridiculous; Äkta Människor is a Swedish TV show, in
Swedish with no subtitles. It makes absolutely no sense that this show is not viewable by Swe-
des all over the world. The only one it makes sense to are local distributors, which as I see it,
should have NO say. Instead, it should be clear how many are watching this show, to the origi-
nal author and the original author should not have the right to decide who is watching.

7. Do you think that further measures are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border avai-
lability of content services in the Single Market [...]?
YES, but I think the question is larger than just EU. I feel that it should not be allowed to re-
gionally limit and restrict who has access to a speciﬁc product. That I cannot play a Japanese
video game on my European game machine, when both are bought and paid for accordingly, is
ridiculous and makes only sense to local distributors, which as I see it should have NO say. I am
buying a product and at that point, the seller should not be allowed to hinder me from using it
based on where I live.

8. Is the scope of ”making available” [...] sufﬁciently clear?
YES I do believe so. The availability could also concern language availability, i.e. if a ﬁlm
is uploaded with French subtitles, that automatically means it’s targetted at countries where
French is widely used.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work [...] be subject to the authorization of
the rightholder?
NO. Because merely pointing in a direction where the information can be had, cannot and must
NEVER be seen as a part in crime, due to many many reasons. Instead, the culpability must lie
on the provider of the information.

12. Should the viewing of a web-page [...] be the subject of authorization of the rightholder.
NO. Simply because this is not reasonable given the current technology. Current technology
allows for no control of whatever will pop up on the screen with the next click, hence an enfor-
cement of this would create unwilling criminals. The culpability must lie within the provider of
the web site where the material is made available.

I see the problem here, with full ﬁlms available via streaming, but this problem must be sol-
ved by other methods than criminalizing whatever might be in the computer’s cache memory.
(This does not only go for copyrighted material, but also illegal material such as classiﬁed state
secrets – the reason of which we simply cannot punish watching something, especially when so
can be done unwillingly).

13. Have you faced restrictions when trying to resell digital ﬁles you have purchased?
YES. I cannot give away my XBOX Live Arcade games to others. I also cannot even ACCESS
the XBOX Live Indie games without always connecting to XBOX Live, which will effectively
kill these games when XBOX Live shuts down.

I generally feel that bought material is bought material, and the seller should have NO right to
restrict my uses of it. For example, if I buy a video game, I should never have to ask for permis-
sion for every single time I play it. Such a behaviour is insulting, and highly violates my private
rights. I am not BORROWING the game, I have BOUGHT it.

I see the problem with ”forward and delete”, but this must be solved by other methods than
online identiﬁcation upon every time of use. Such is abuse by big corporations as they are often
in a monopoly situation as the creator of the game. In effect, this means that they can take away
whatever you have bought, at their whim, which is not compatible with current laws or common
sense. You’ve sold it, you’ve lost it. Problems connected to you losing the product must be dealt
with in other ways than enforcing an ability to retake the product at will.

15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identiﬁcation and licen-
sing of works and other subject matter?
YES.
However, with that I do not want to say I would like such a system implemented, because I
dislike the possible disadvantages too much. But it would help, it would.

16. Possible advantages?
It would enable people to quickly check who is the author of a speciﬁc product.

17 Possible disadvantages?
It might eventually turn into an unofﬁcial ”no choice but to”-situation, which might in turn
develop into ”as the copyright holder wasn’t registered, there was no knowing the product was
protected” situation, which rhymes badly with the current prohibition of formalities for protec-
tion of rights.

18. What incentives for registration?
”Possible licensees will ﬁnd you more quickly”.

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
NO. As of my base stance, they must be WAY shorter. 60 years after publication, tops. 70 years
after author’s death is so over the top that any foreign life form would consider us less intelli-
gent than we are.

They should also vary depending on media form. Having a copyright protection for a computer
game and a book starts to border on the ridiculous. That copyright for games for the Commo-
dore 64 is still many years in the doings is preventing digital museums from doing their work,
and it’s also serving absolutely no purpose. With the Commodore 64, the ZX Spectrum, the
Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Master System,
Sega Mega Drive etc etc completely off the market and support, there is no further revenue of
these old works for the authors. Digital media that is highly platform-dependant (that does not
include digital text ﬁles that displays on any machine, even future) should be covered by a diffe-
rent ruleset. I will not spend more of your time with details on this ruleset, it sufﬁces to say they
must be different.

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the
EU copyright directive are iptional for the Member States?
YES there can certainly be, though I am unsure of all the exceptions and limitations. For ex-
ample, it might be that someone in Belgium releases a product in French that, as it counts as
targetted at France too, needs to be paid for there, which was quite hard to know to begin with.
However, I do think that even if problems do arise, it’s not something that can be regulated at
EU level.

22. Should some/all exceptions be made mandatory?
Exceptions that cause many and severe problems should. The others should be as is.

28. Have you experienced speciﬁc problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and
archive speciﬁc works or other subject matter in your collection?
YES. Not personally, but as an avid video gamer fan, I know of the MASSIVE problem that old
media needs to be constantly copied in order to be preserved – the magnetic media is deterio-
rating. As an individual who considers our gaming history as a part of culture as much as our
music, this is a MAJOR PROBLEM and must be addressed immediately, allowing either un-
restricted copying of platform-dependant computer ﬁles after a mere 20 years, or at least a very
simple exception for museums and archivers.

29. if there are problems, how would they best be solved?
See above. Either by shortening the copyright for platform-dependant computer software (pre-
ferred) or making an exception for museums and archivers (hotﬁx)

30. What would be its main elements? Which activities of the beneﬁciary institutions should be
covered and under which conditions?
As above. Main elements being either shortening the copyright for platform-dependant compu-
ter software (preferred) or making an exception for museums and archivers (hotﬁx).
The beneﬁciary institutions should be ”[cultural] archivers for future generations”, the deﬁni-
tion being as broad as possible. There should be no conditions (the products need not be shown,
displayed or used in any way).

42. Have you experienced speciﬁc problems when trying to use works [...] for teaching, inclu-
ding across borders?
NO. But I have done so, unsolicited. I have used copyrighted material in teaching languages, for
reading practices. I can ﬁnd no sensible reason as to why this should be forbidden.

45. What would be the legislative solution’s main elements? Which activities of the beneﬁciary
institutions should be covered and under which conditions?
Any teaching institution should be able to use copyrighted material in the education. A teach-
ing institution includes of course, schools as per the Member State’s deﬁnitions. This does not
include non-educative activities on the school premises.

58. Have you expeerienced problems when trying to use pre-ecisting works or other subject
matter to disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?
YES. Or personally no, but I know of enough of the problems to see this as a major problem.

My stance on user-generated content is as stated in my general stance, that CONCEPT should
have a much shorter protected time than WORK.

What is a copy of a WORK and what is merely use of CONCEPT, is of course a gray area, but
will in most cases be clear, and will in sued cases have to be decided by a court (as today). Just
a changed pixel, or cropped image, is still a copy of WORK. A million cropped images, molded
together to form a new image, is use of CONCEPTs.

I want to add that any ”problems” seen by rights holders, occuring from User Generated Con-
tent such as fan art, fan ﬁction and the likes, should be largely ignore, if accompanied by such
nonsense babbel as ”our legacy is hurt” or ”it damages our other products”. Such problems only
occur as a gut feeling based on that we are brough up with such ridiculous copyright lengths so
we falsely believe we are ”hurt” by others products when, in fact, we are not.

64. Is there need to clarify at the EU level the scope and appliation of the private copyring and
repography exceptions?
YES, though I am unsure as to how they are phrased. I would like a clear ”producing copies
within the private sphere is allowed”, where ”private sphere” would naturally be a gray area to
clear out should a court case pop up, though it’s pretty easily deﬁned as the immediate person
and family.

68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue levy
payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of
goods or services?
NO, not yet. But I might. There is now talks of a board game printing in Spain, where people
are claiming that, as this game’s title is trademarked by other companies in other EU countries,
this would be labeled as ”counterfeit” by the customs, though I am unsure as to this really is so
(I doubt so).

72. What is the best mechanism to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances.
The copyright of the WORK should NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, be able to be
transferred. It should always belong to the individual or group of individuals that originally
created them. NOT transferred to a company, for example. The only exception should be if the
author dies prior to the expiration of the copyright, in which case it should be inherited by the
inheritors.

73. Is there a need to act at the EU level?
YES. Prohibit the transferring of authorship and copyright. If not prohibited, as the market is in
certain areas, authorship and copyright are constantly transferred, stripping the authors of the
rights to the work. This is UNACCEPTABLE.

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufﬁcient involvement
of intermediaries in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose?
NO. As I have understood, currently intermediaries can be held responsible for infringements,
which is unacceptable. On order, they must remove the infringer, but they cannot act police. If
they do, they will be over-zealous to avoid problems, which means we will get a stricter envi-
ronment than is wished for.

An ISP or payment service provider should be forced to stop services to someone infringing,
but they should NOT, repeat NOT, be held culpable.

Thank you.

As said, I have spent a lifetime sorting this out, and I hope that you will take that into account.
While I have of course niched myself into copyrights regarding mostly entertainment, I do hope
you will consider the above, recognizing that none of it was said lightly.
