1.Introduction

2.Context of the consultation

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet
have reshaped the ways in which content is created,
distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised
for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a
novel, a song), fornew and existing distribution platforms, for
institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research
and for citizens who now expect to be able to access
content-for information, education or entertainment
purposes-regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is
for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of
distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to
ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and
enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these
challenges: ensuring that theEUcopyright regulatory framework
stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support
creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single
Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote
cultural diversity.

In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1

COM(2012)789final,18/12/2012.

the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action: on the one
hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise
theEUcopyright legislative framework2

"Based on market studies and impact assessment and legal
drafting work"as announced in the Communication(2012)789.

with a view to a decision in2014on whether to table legislative
reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical
industry- led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue
"Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid progress was
deemed necessary and possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now3

See the document "Licences for Europe-templedges to bring more
content
online":http://ec.europa.eu/internalmarket/copvright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113
ten-pledges en.pdf.

. The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders
have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four
Working Groups (cross border portability of services,
user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these
pledges to be a further step in making the user environment
easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes
note of the fact that two groups-user-generated content and
text and data mining-did not reach consensus among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be
addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of
"Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in the
context of the review of the legislative framework.

As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a
public consultation on issues identified in the Communicationon
Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:"territoriality in
the Internal Market,harmonisation,limitations and exceptions to
copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of theEUcopyright
market; and how to improve the effectiveness and efficiencyof
enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform".As highlighted in the
October2013European CouncilConclusions4

EUCO169/13, 24/25October2013.

"Providing digital servicesand content across the single market
requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the
digital age. The Commission will therefore complete its
on-going review of theEUcopyright framework in spring2014.It is
important to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of
intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural
diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public
hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright
in the knowledge economy"5

COM(2008)466/3,http://ec.europa.eu/internalmarket/copyright/copyright-infso/index
en.htm#maincontentSec2.

, the "Green Paper on the onlinedistribution of audiovisual
works"6

COM(2011)427final,http://ec.europa.eu/internalmarket/consultations/2011/audiovisual
en.htm.

and "Content Online"7

http://ec.europa.eu/internalmarket/consultations/2009/content
online en.htm.

. These consultations provided valuable feedback from
stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as
the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome
territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination
of knowledge, and rightholders' remuneration, particularly in
the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders
representing all stages in the value chain, including right
holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions
elicited widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The
"Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was followed
up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper on the
online distributionof audiovisual works" have fed into
subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights Management
Directive and into the current review process.

5.Rightsand the functioning of the Single Market

A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services
from anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital
transmissions and the segmentation of the market through
licensing agreements]

Holders of copyright and related rights-e.g. writers, singers,
musicians-do not enjoy a single protection in theEU.Instead,
they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights
in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised
by the existingEU Directives. However, differencesremain and the
geographical scope of the rights is limited tothe territory of
the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial
in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a
country-by-country basis under national law8

This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on
several occasions.

.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the
Internet-e.g. by a music streaming service,or by an online
e-book seller - therefore requires, in principle, an
authorisation for each national territory in which the content
is communicated to the public. Rightholders are, of course, in
a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European
licence, such that content services can be provided in several
Member States and across borders. A number of steps have been
taken atEUlevel to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the
proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights Management9

Proposal fora Directive of the European Parliament and of the
Council of11July2012on collective management of copyright and
related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in
musical works for online uses in the internal market,
COM(2012)372final.

should significantly facilitate the delivery
ofmulti­territoriallicences in musical works for online
services10

Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in
the management of online rights for musical works in contrast
to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by
right holders such as film or record producers or by newspaper
or book publishers.

; the structured stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe"11

You can find more information on the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/.

and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition12

You can find more information on the following
website:http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org/.

.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue
of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers
having subscribed to onlineservices in their Member State to
keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member
States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector
issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue
working towards the further development of cross-border
portability13

See the document "Licences for Europe-templedges to bring more
content
online":http://ec.europa.eu/internalmarket/copvright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113ten-pledges
en.pdf.

.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the
cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These
problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access
services that are made available in Member States other than
the one inwhich they live. Not all online services are
available in all Member States and consumers face problems when
trying

to access such services across borders. In some instances, even
if the "same" service is available in all Member States,
consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their "national" service, and if they try to access
the "same" service in another Member State they are redirected
to the one designated for their country of residence).

This situation may in part stemfrom the territoriality of rights
and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights in
different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing
agreements between right holders and distributors and/or
between distributors and end users may also be atthe origin of
some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further
measures (legislative ornon­legislative,including market-led
solutions) need to be taken atEUlevel in the medium term14

For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a
European Copyright Code (establishing a single title) see
sectionVIIof this consultation document.

to increase the cross-border availability of content services in
the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
protection for right holders.

Ein einheitlicher EU-weiter Rechtekatalog für Urheber ist sicher

Tatsächlich geht es dabei aber immer nur um den Profit für
diejenigen, die das geistige Eigentum schliesslich nutzen bzw.
verkaufen.; die Urheber werden zunehmends unterbezahlt und in
ihren Rechten ausgehebelt. Auf Dauer zerstört dies die
Existenzgrundlage der Urheber.

Also: nur wenn der Urheber auf hohem Niveau geschützt wird ist

6.Is there a need for more clarityas regards the scope of what
needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]

The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related
rights in the digital environment is largely established by
Directive 2001/29/EC15

Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of22May2001on theharmonisationof certain aspects of
copyright and related rights in the information society.

ontheharmonisationof certain aspects of copyright and related
rights in the information society. OtherEUdirectives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those
relating to the protection of software16

Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of23April2009on the legal protection of computer
programs.

and databases17

Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of11March1996on the legal protection of databases.

.

Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and
neighbouring rightholders18

Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are
holders of so-called "neighbouring rights" in, respectively,
their films, records, performancesand broadcast. Authors'
content protected by copyright is referred to as a "work" or
"works", while content protected by neighbouring rights is
referred to as "other subject matter".

which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of
works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g.
a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.

[-- Image: Picture 3 --]The most relevant rights for digital
transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies19

The right to "authorise or prohibit direct or indirect,
temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any
form, in whole or in part" (see Art.2of Directive 2001/29/EC)
although temporary acts of reproduction of a transient or
incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see
art.5(1)of Directive 2001/29/EC).

, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission-e.g. the
uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of
making it available-and at the users' end-e.g. when a user
downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to
the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise
or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks20

The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the
public by wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit
the making available to the public "on demand" (see Art.3of
Directive 2001/29/EC).

. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions
and both need to be cleared.

7.The act of "making available"

Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neitherwhatis covered by the
making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by
the public, the actual reception by the public) norwherethe act
of "making available" takes place. This does not raise questions
if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise
however when the transmission covers several territories and
rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available"
happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the
countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each
of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?).
The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the
European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the
"targeting" of a certain Member State's public21

See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco
vsSportradar)and Case C-5/11(Donner)for copyright and related
rights, and Case C-324/09(L'Oréalvs eBay)for trademarks. With
regard to jurisdiction see also joined Cases C-585/08 and
C-144/09 (Pammer and HotelAlpenhof)and pending
CaseC-441/13(PezHejduk);see however, adopting a different
approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDGMediatech).

. According tothis approach the copyright-relevant act (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which
are "targeted" by the online service provider. A service
provider "targets" a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via
advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency
specifically targeted at that group.

8.Is the scopeof the "making available" right in cross-border
situations— i.e.when content is disseminated across
borders—sufficiently clear?

YES

X NO-Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach
explained above, as in "country of origin" approach22

The objective of implementing a "country of origin" approach is
to localise the copyright relevant act that must be licenced in
a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be
for example the Member State in which the content is uploaded
or where the service provider is established), regardless of in
how many Member States the work can be accessed or received.
Such an approach has already been introduced atEUlevel with
regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyrightand rights
related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and
cable retransmission).

)

Hier geht esm.E.um zwei verschiedene Rechte:das
Bereithaltungsrecht und das Abrufsrecht. Diese werden hier

handelt.

^NO OPINION

[In particular if you are aright holder:]Could a clarification
of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have
an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you
are considered to be an author or not, whether you are
considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your
remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
availability of injunctive relief14)?

XYES-Please explain how such potential effects could be
addressed

8.Tworightsinvolvedina single act of exploitation

Each act of transmission indigital networks entails (in the
current state of technology and law) several reproductions.
This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available
right. This may complicate the licensingof works for online use
notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

[Inparticular if you a service provider or a right holder:]Does
the application of two rights to a single act of economic
exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create
problems for you?

order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint
licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to
achieve the "bundlingof rights")

9.Linking and browsing

Hyperlinksare references to data thatlead a user from one
location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for
the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU23

CasesC-466/12(Svensson),C-348/13(BestwaterInternational) and
C-279/13 (CMore entertainment).

in which the question has been raised whether the provision of a
clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the
public/making available to the public subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly
creates temporary copies ofworks and other subject-matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the
CJEU24

CaseC-360/13 (PublicRelationsConsultants Association Ltd). See
alsohttp://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC2011
0202PressSummary.pdf.

as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory
exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in
Article5(1)of Directive 2001/29/EC.

10.Download to own digital content

Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital
transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the
possibility for users to disposeof the files they buy in this
manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The
principle ofEUexhaustion of the distribution right applies in
the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a
tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the
right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that
tangible article)25

See alsorecital28of Directive2001/29/EC.

. The issue that arises hereis whether this principle can also
be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in
its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the
property of the copy)26

InCaseC-128/11 (Oraclevs.UsedSoft)theCJEUruled thatanauthor
cannot oppose the resale of a second­hand licence that allows
downloading his computer program from his website and using it
for an unlimited period of time. The exclusive right of
distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a
licence is exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus
admitted that the distribution right may be subject to
exhaustion in case of computer programs offered for download
with the right holder's consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decisionbased on the Computer
Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule
constitutedalex specialisin relation to the Information Society
Directive (UsedSoft, par.51, 56).

. This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the
practicalapplication of such an approach (how to avoid
re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have
"re-sold" it-this is often referred to as the "forward and
delete" question) as well as to the economic implications of
the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect
quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand
market for physical goods).

11.Registration of works and other subject matter-is it a good
idea?

Registration is not often discussed in copyright in theEUas the
existing internationaltreaties in the area prohibit formalities
as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute27

For example, it does not affect "domestic" works-i.e. works
originating in the country imposing the formalities as opposed
to works originating in another country.

. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and
exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with
the increased opportunities that digital technology provides
for the use of content (including older works and works that
otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and
disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being
considered28

On thebasis of Article3.6of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council of25October 2012 on
certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible
online database is currently being set up by the Office
forHarmonisationofthe Internal Market (OHIM) for the
registration of orphan works.

.

Would the creation of a registration system atEUlevel help in
the identification and licensing of works and other subject
matter?

12.How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

There are many private databases of works and other subject
matter held by producers, collective management organisations,
and institutions such as libraries, which are based to a
greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less)
interoperable, internationally agreed 'identifiers'.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a
work, are specific to the sector in which they have been
developed29

E.g. the International StandardRecording Code (ISRC) is used to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number
(ISBN) is used to identify books.

, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the
contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are
notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to
improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases.
The Global Repertoire Database30

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:http://www.globalrepertoiredatabase.com/.

should, once operational, provide a single source of information
on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition31

You will find more information about this initiative (funded in
part by the European Commission) on the following
website:www.linkedcontentcoalition.org.

was established to develop building blocks for the expression
and management of rights and licensing across all content and
media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference
Model (RRM)-a comprehensive data model for all types of rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub32

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:http^/www.copyrighthub.co.uk/.

is seeking to take such identification systems a step further,
and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing
acrossdifferent sectors.

19.What should be the role of theEUin promoting the adoption of
identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the
development and interoperability of rights ownership and
permissions databases?

[Open question]

auch die Urheber sinnvoll repräsentiert und deren Belange und
Interessen eingebracht. Dies ist notwendig, um dem reinen
Marktinteresse von Medienunternehmen ausgleichend entgegen zu
wirken.

13.Term ofprotection-is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for
a limited period of time. After the term of protection has
expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national
rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention33

Berne Convention for the Protectionof Literary and Artistic
Works,http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.

requires a minimum term of protection of50years after the death
of the author.

TheEUrules extend this term of protection to70years after the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram
producers, the term provided for in theEUrules also
extend20years beyond what is mandatedin international
agreements, providing for a term of protection of70years after
the first publication. Performers and producers in the
audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an
extended term of protection.

20.Are the current terms of copyright protection still
appropriate in the digital environment?

XYES-Please explain

14.Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights
enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter,
without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for
certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use
forillustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a
teacher in a literature class). AtEUlevel they are established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive
2001/29/EC34

Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases;
Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of computer
programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending
right.

.

Exceptions and limitations in the national andEUcopyright laws
have to respect international law35

Article9(2)of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works(1971);Article13of the TRIPS
Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property
Rights)1994;Article16(2)of theWIPOPerformers and Phonograms
Treaty(1996);Article9(2)of theWIPOCopyright Treaty(1996).

. In accordance with international obligations, theEUacquis
requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in
certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the
rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included
inEUlaw is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to
the rights harmonised atEUlevel)36

Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor
importance for analogue uses existing in Member States at the
time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

, these limitations and

exceptionsare often optional37

With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer
Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive,(iii)Article5(1)in the Directive 2001/29/EC
and(iv)the Orphan Works Directive.

, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in
national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish.
Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and
exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to
the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement
them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting
that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in
theEUlegal framework for copyright are of equivalent
significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.

In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the
rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the
territory of the Member State), the definition of the
limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so
an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may
still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move
to the Member State "B")38

Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works
Directive (a mandatory exception to copyrightand related rights
in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be
located) has been given across­bordereffect, which means that,
for instance, once a literary work-for instance a novel-is
considered an orphan work in a Member State, that same novel
shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and can
be used and accessed in all Member States.

Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed
fromtheexisting catalogue? Please explainby referring to
specific cases.

fair-use or fair dealing provision/open norm,etc.)? Please
explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible
effects onthefunctioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]

26.Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in
your experience, constitute a problem?

.

The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also
raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In
some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or
exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are
not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the
books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a
Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify
which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being
raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that theEUand
Member States' regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an
exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation
of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in theEUand
Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required
legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single
Market, and respecting theEU'sinternational obligations.

limitations and exceptions provided in theEUcopyright
directives are optional for the Member States?

where?)

A.Access tocontent inlibraries and archives

Directive2001/29/ECenables MemberStatesto reflect in their
nationallaw a range of limitations and exceptions for the
benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If
implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and
archiving39

Article 5(2)c of Directive2001/29.

and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions40

Article 5(3)n of Directive2001/29.

. Thepubliclending (under an exception or limitation) by these
establishments of physical copies of works and other subject
matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive41

Article5of Directive 2006/115/EC.

.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to
achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be
clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the
same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible
expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject
matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders.
The role oflicensing and possible framework agreements between
different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1. Preservation and archiving

The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter
held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,
records, or films)-the restoration or replacement of works, the
copying of fragile works-may involve the creation of another
copy/ies of these

works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an
exception in their national laws allowing for the making of such
preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State (as regards the type of
beneficiary establishments, the types of works/subject-matter
covered by the exception,the mode of copying and the number of
reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also,
the current legal status of new types of preservation activities
(e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web content)
is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation
of works and other subject- matter (consulting an e-book,
watching a documentary)viadedicated terminals on the premises
of such establishments forthepurpose of research and private
study. The online consultation of works and other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when thelibrary user is not on

the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is
generally addressed in agreements between
universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law
rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to,
and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

E-lending

Traditionally, public librarieshave loaned physical copies of
works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users.
Recent technological developments have made it technically
possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access
to digital content,

such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current
legal framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of
the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently
experimenting with different business models for the making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

17.Mass digitisation

[-- Image: Picture 4 --]The term "mass digitisation" is normally
used to refer to efforts by institutions such as libraries and
archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of
their collections with an objective to preserve these
collections and, normally, to makethem available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the
early part of the 20thcentury or whole collections of pictures
of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at
theEUlevel by the2011Memorandum ofUnderstanding (MoU) on key
principles on the digitisation and making available of out of
commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the
normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate
mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on
the basis of licence agreements between libraries and similar
cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting
societies representing authors and publishers on the other42

You will find more information about his MoU on the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internalmarket/copyright/out-of-commerce/index
en.htm.

. Providedtherequired funding is ensured (digitisation projects
are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that
books that are currently to be found only in the archives of,
for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available
online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences
(granted by Collective Management Organisations on the basis of
themandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some
Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the
largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing
in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting
society or therecognition of an "extended effect" to the
licences granted)43

France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the
effects of the MoU. The French
act(LOIn°2012-287du1ermars2012relativeà l'exploitation
numériquedes livres indisponibles du xxe
siècle)foreseescollective management,unless the author or
publisher in question opposes such management. The German
act(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und
einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom1.Oktober2013)containsalegalpresumption of representation by
a collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are
not members of the collecting society.

18.Teaching

Directive 2001/29/EC44

Article 5(3)a of Directive2001/29.

enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for
non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow
a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his
course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or
of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected
content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation
from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional)
provision allows for rather different implementation at Member
States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State toMember State, with several Member States
providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for
certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and
study at home.

subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by
increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union)47

The Marrakesh Treaty48

Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by
Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities,
Marrakesh, June17to28 2013.

has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for
persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright
that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute
and make available accessible format copies to visually
impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders.
TheEUand its Member States have started work to sign and ratify
the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions
atEUlevel (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible
format copies across borders).

21.Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics49

For the purpose of the present document, the term "text and data
mining" will be used.

are different terms used to describe increasingly important
techniques used in particular by researchersfor the exploration
of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web
sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or other
automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and
data in order to obtain new insights, patternsand trends.

The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible
on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g.
journals and periodicalsthat give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g.
on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto
the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis.
Normally, it is considered thatto mine protected works or other
subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the
right holders for the making of such copies unless such
authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to
general public without restrictions on the internet, open
access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are
covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article5.1of
Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining
activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None
of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does
not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in
several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go
beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain
the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need
to obtain "access" to content (i.e. being able to use e.g.
commercial databases).

A specific Working Group wasset up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time,
practical solutions to

facilitatetext and data mining of subscription-based scientific
content were presented by publishers as an outcome of "Licences
for Europe"50

See the document "Licences for Europe-ten pledges to bring more
content
online":http://ec.europa.eu/internalmarket/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/BUB
ten-pledges en.pdf.

. In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued
that no additional licences should be required to mine material
to which access has been provided through a subscription
agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and
data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of a
distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.(a)[In particular if you arean end user/consumer or an
institutional user:]Have you experienced obstacles, linked to

22.User-generated content

Technological and service developmentsmean that citizens can
copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial
cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called
"user-generated content". While users can create totally
original content, they can also take one or several
pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload
the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms andblogs51

A typical example could be the "kitchen" or "wedding" video
(adding one's own video toa pre-existing sound recording), or
adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other
examples are "mash-ups" (blending two sound recordings), and
reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.)
ina blog.

.User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of
pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work
does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from
merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing
content with other pre-existingcontent. This kind of activity
is not "new" as such. However, the development of social
networking and social media sites that enable users to share
content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities
and increased the potential economic impactfor those holding
rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the
preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With
the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is
open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with
regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and
the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results or even the
definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were
presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One
view was to say that a new exception is needed to coverUGC, in
particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as
combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of
photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is
needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between
rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded
between rightholders and the users generating the content. In
any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content
and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by
rightholders across different sectors as a result of the
"Licences for Europe" discussions52

61.If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

BeiUser-generated content (UGC)kommen zahlreiche verschiedene
Interessen zusammen.

Auch was privat genutzt werden soll, geschieht meistens
öffentlich, weil der UGC ins Netz gestellt wird und jede
private Website in der Regel weltweit abrufbar ist. Es geht
also nicht um private Nutzungen, sondern um urheberrechtlich
relevante Vorgänge (Vervielfältigung, öffentliche
Zugänglichmachung etc.). Das gilt erst recht, wenn
kommerzielle Zwecke verfolgt werden. Betroffen sind deshalb all
diejenigen, die die Werke den Endverbrauchern wahrnehmbar machen
oder daran mitwirken, insbesondere Plattformbetreiber; denn
selbst wenn die Dienste solcher Plattformen von Privatleuten
genutzt werden, agieren doch die Plattformbetreiber durchweg
kommerziell. Sie sollten sich die erforderlichen Rechte von den
Verwertungsgesellschaften und den sonstigen
Rechtsinhabernbeschaffen müssen, wenn es die nicht kommerziell
handelnden Nutzer dieser Plattformen nicht tun (und das
Geschäftsmodell der Plattformbetreiber auch gar nicht
vorsieht,dassdie Nutzer es tun).

Außerdem sollte unter dem Begriff UGC nicht gezählt werden, was
unter dessen Deckmantel einfach nur unverändert und ohne
Einwilligung der Rechtsinhaber genutzt wird. Werden fremde
Werke unverändert genutzt, müssen hierfür die einschlägigen
Nutzungsrechte erworben werden.

Werden die Werke in veränderterForm genutzt, sind
dieUrheberpersönlichkeitsrechte zu beachten. In der Regel
werden entsprechende Bearbeitungsrechte ebenfalls von den
Rechtsinhabern erworben werden müssen.

Anders könnte es sich verhalten, wenn fremde Werke nur als
Anregung für eigenesWerkschaffen dienen. Das setzt aber
voraus,dassder Nutzer das fremde Werk weder ganz noch in Teilen
übernimmt, sondern sich nur von dem Werk anregen lässt, um
etwas Eigenständiges und Individuelles zu schaffen. Diese
Eigenständigkeitmussso weit reichen,dassdas Werk, von dem sich
der Nutzer anregen ließ, hinter dem neu entstandenen Werk
verblasst.

Grundsätzlichmussauch hier bei kommerziellen Nutzungen an eine
Vergütungspflicht gedacht werden.

23.Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their
national legislation exceptions or limitations to the
reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying53

Article5.2)(a) and (b)of Directive2001/29.

. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods
typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording
equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such
as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made
without their authorisation by certain categories of persons
(i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or
through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that
context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the
question arises as to whether the copying of files by
consumers/end-users who have purchased content online-e.g. when
a person has bought an MP3 file andgoes on to store multiple
copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile
phone)-also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these
levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the
licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to
instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on
top of service providers' licence fees5657.

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or
not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as
personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.In your view, is there a need to clarify at theEUlevel the
scope and application of the private copying and reprography
exceptions5in the digital environment?

Divergingnationalsystems levy different products and apply
different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free
circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the
same time, many Member States continue to allow the
indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all
transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product
subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In
that context,not all Member States have ex ante exemption and/or
ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these
situations and reduce the number of undue payments56

24.Fair remuneration of authors and performers

TheEUcopyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a
number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose
performances are fixed in phonograms,remuneration rights. There
are few provisions in theEUcopyright law governing
thetransferof rights from authors or performers to producers57

See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or
other subject matter is created in the context of an employment
contract58

See e.g. Art.2.3.of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art.4of Directive
96/9/EC.

. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member
States to regulate and there are significant differences in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist
between different sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are
not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as
regardsonline exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared
along the whole value chain. Another commonly raised issue
concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders
are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice
to improve their situation and that action atEUlevel is
necessary.

best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that

so kann gewährleistet bleiben,dassAutoren nicht erpressbar sind
und angemessen vergütet werden.

73.Is there a need to act at theEUlevel (for instance to
prohibit certain clauses in contracts)?

XYES-Please explain

Wir Urheber müssen in Verträgen meist sämtliche Rechte zeitlich
unbefristet einräumen. Z.B. im„Music forGames" aber auch in
Werbung werden mittlerweile aber nur noch einmal Vergütungen
bezahlt, die gemessen an der Dauer der Nutzung viel zu niedrig
sind. Diese Nutzungsdauer sollte grundlegend beschränkt werden,
sodassdem Autor die Möglichkeit gegebn wird, zusätzliche
Vergütungenb für sich anschliessende Nutzungen auszuhandeln.
Wenn das Werk des Autors über viele jahre gefragt ist und
genutzt wird, dann sollte es eben auch für viele Jahre vergütet
werden. Die derzeitigen Vergütungen hingegen sind bestenfallsfür
die mittelfristige Nutzung von2-3Jahren adäquat.

Derzeitig ist es Standard,dassTV-Sender von Komponisten
verlangen,dassdiese ihre Verlagsrechte an einen vom jeweiligen
Sender beauftraten Musikverlag abtreten:"Zwangsinverlagnahme"
Komponisten,die sich darauf nicht einlassen, werden nicht
beauftragt. Defacto entspricht aber die Abtretung der
Verlagsrechte einer Reduktion der Urheberrechtstantiemen

Das Beispiel „Zwangsinverlagnahme":

hier müsste es möglich sein,dassz.B. eine
Verwertungsgesellschaft im Namen aller Urheber gerichtlich
prüfen lassen könnte, ob derartige Vertragsklauseln
rechtsgültig sind. Der einzelne Urheber ist aufgrund seiner
wirtschaftlichen Abhängigkeit nicht in der Lage derartige
Missbräuche gerichtlich klären zu lassen und damit offen in die
Konfrontation mit seinen Auftragsgebern zu gehen. Die
Verwertungsgesellschaften hingegen wären als Sprachrohr für die
Gesamtheit der Komponisten hingegen in der Lage, diese
Missbräuche zu bekämpfen ohne,dassder einzelne dadurch einen
wirtschaftlichen Schaden hat (weil ihm Aufträge verloren
gehen).

25.Respect forrights

Directive 2004/48/EE59

Directive 2004/48/EC of theEuropean Parliament and of the
Council of29April2004on the enforcement of intellectual
property rights.

provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related
rights. The Commission hasconsulted broadly on this text60

You will find more information on the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internalmarket/iprenforcement/directive/index
en.htm

. Concerns have been raisedas to whether some of its provisions
are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the
digital age. On the one

hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with
the new challenges brought by the dissemination of digital
content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and
the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right
for a private life and data protection. While it cannot be
contested that enforcement measures should always be available
in case of infringement of copyright, measures could be
proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose61

For example when the infringing content is offered on a website
which gets advertising revenues that depend on the volume of
traffic.

. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of
intermediaries in the IP infrastructure62

This clarification should not affect the liability regime of
intermediaryservice providers established by Directive
2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

. At the same time, there could be clarification of the
safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for
private users.

commercial purpose?

26.A singleEU Copyright Title

[-- Image: Picture 5 --]The idea of establishing aunified EU
Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debatefor
quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the
feasibility of such an objective are divided. A
unifiedEUCopyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in theEUand replace national laws. There would
then be a singleEUtitle instead of a bundle of national rights.
Some see this as the only manner in which a truly Single Market
for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others
believe that the same objective can better be achieved by
establishing a higher level ofharmonisationwhile allowing for a
certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States'
legal systems.
