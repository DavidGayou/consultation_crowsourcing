   I.      Access to your content across Europe
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying
to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)


  NO


  NO OPINION


3. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] How
often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]

                                                                                         1
I almost always grant multi-territorial licences, which is the rule in the book publishing sector.
5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples


  NO
There are rarely reasons to restrict access to my e-books.
  NO OPINION


7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  YES – Please explain


  NO – Please explain
Firstly, we believe that the Services Directive (Directive 2006/123/EC of 12 December 2006
on services in the internal market) should continue to apply to copyright management
services. Secondly, no further measures are necessary to increase cross-border availability.
But to ensure smooth functioning of the market, enforcement has to be enhanced. We believe,
therefore that service providers and platforms offering copyright-protected content, as well as
search engines and social media sites should play a greater role in raising consumer awareness
for the need for copyright compliance and should also more pro-actively work with
rightsholders to create a legally secure environment for rightsholder licensing that facilitates
smooth circulation of content legally made available and sourced. Ultimately, a copyright
compliant environment will enhance network services of providers and content owners and
lead to an increase in consumer choice, further growth, innovation and development.


  NO OPINION


8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content
is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


  YES




                                                                                                2
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach1)




    NO OPINION


9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of
the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether
you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred
your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
availability of injunctive relief2)?
    YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed




    NO
    NO OPINION


10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")




    NO
    NO OPINION


4. Download to own digital content
14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.


1
  The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that must
be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member State in
which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many Member
States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with
regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
2
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                                3
    [Open question]
III.The Copyright Directive does not foresee “digital exhaustion” for the reproduction and
       making available rights (which are the rights implicated in digital licensing) and clearly
       limits exhaustion to the distribution of physical copies by way of sale or other transfer of
       ownership. This is because digital reproductions are perfect clones of their original and
       cannot be considered as a mere and degraded copy as normally understood in the physical
       world. Furthermore “forward and delete” does not seem enforceable with today’s
       technology. As recognised in this consultation, the ability to resell of previously
       purchased digital content would have severe economic implications on the book sector.
IV.Such an approach which introduces the concept of exhaustion to the right of distribution when
      distribution takes place by transmission fails to recognise the inherent differences in
      physical and digital products. Specifically, the nature of digital is such that quality
      remains perfect over time, in contrast to physical goods where there is a degree of
      deterioration over time. The second hand market for physical goods therefore has less of
      an impact of the primary market, which can still function alongside a secondary market.
      By contrast, with digital products the lack of deterioration in quality means that a
      secondary market directly competes with the primary market and inevitably undermines it.
      There would be no reason for any reader to pay for a new ebook if the identical file was
      available second hand at a lower price.
 V.If a rule on consumption for e-books was introduced it would mean that part of the 1st sales
       would be transferred to the “used e-book market”. It is not unrealistic to consider that due
       to the identity in products it could imply that up to 50 % or more of the sales would be
       transferred to the “used market”. This would imply that the 1st sale would have to be at a
       much higher price because fewer units have to secure the same incomes allowing a
       reasonable return of investment to the author and publisher. Higher prices would make it
       more relevant for the consumer to choose the “used” e-book instead of the “original” e-
       book and it is hard to imagine how a negative spiral can be avoided. The price setting for
       the original e-book will be almost impossible if consumption is allowed.
VI.Further, it is impossible to determine whether a digital good has been sold; unlike a physical
      sale where there is a transfer to another user and the denial of the continuing use of the
      physical good by the seller, in the digital environment this is not the case – both the seller
      and purchaser can continue to use the digital product. The implications for widespread
      copyright infringement – and concurrent difficulties in enforcement – are obvious.
VII.Applying the principle of exhaustion to digital products would also stymie the development of
       new business models. License terms should therefore continue to be the norm in the area
       of text-based works, such as books and journal articles. Both in the case of books and
       increasingly in the case of journal articles, content is being sold at “below the book” and
       “below the article” level, ie in chapters, extracts, original and non-original datasets. Users
       may purchase access to works or receive copies of electronic works and other subject-
       matter under a variety of conditions, including temporary access, streaming, discounted
       purchases, including combined discounts for print copies and electronic access,
       subscription access for a specified time period, special formats and normalised formats for
       further automated use. Regulation aimed at allowing resale will stifle innovation,
       especially at the lower cost part of the market. For example, a consumer may prefer to buy
       a 99 Euro-cent copy of a book with resale restrictions, rather than purchase a Euro 5.99
       copy that allows resale. These are matters of consumer preference and choice. Laws
       which forbid restrictions on resale may lead to higher prices and fewer options for
       consumers, and will make rightsholders more cautious about entering into new digital

                                                                                                   4
         markets and experimenting with new business models. Alternatively, academic textbook
         publishers will have to “price-in” the anticipated re-use thereby making the purchase of
         the initial copy unnecessarily more expensive. This will in turn increase the risk of piracy
         and unauthorised uses, with a further detrimental effect – a potentially vicious downward
         spiral.

VIII.          Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
    21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided
    in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
        YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases




        NO – Please explain
    We do not see any problems, as most of the important exceptions to the benefit of teaching,
    research, libraries or disabled persons are in place in all legislations across Europe.
        NO OPINION

    22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a
    higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
        YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases




        NO – Please explain
    This would not be compatible with the respect for cultural and national traditions which are an
    integral part of our authors’ rights/copyright legislations.
        NO OPINION

    24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree
    of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
        YES – Please explain why




        NO – Please explain why
    The EU regulatory framework is sufficiently flexible.
        NO OPINION


    26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
    a problem?

                                                                                                   5
      YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to




      NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
   As a publishing house, we rely on exceptions such as the exception for quotation and then sell
   books across Europe and to the rest of the world. We have never encountered problems.
      NO OPINION

   27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have
   cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when
   such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
    [Open question]
   It is crucial that exceptions be remunerated. If uses are made across borders, we need to
   decide which party is to pay,as cross-border uses should not lead to the disappearance of
   compensations which are owed to authors and publishers for the effect of the exception on the
   commercial exploitation of our works.

   A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
1. Preservation and archiving
   28. (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use
   by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
      YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.




      NO
      NO OPINION

2. Off-premises access to library collections


   32. (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:]
    We have not negotiated such agreements.


3. E – lending

   36. (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
   libraries to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across
   borders?
      YES – Please explain with specific examples


                                                                                               6
Traditionally, library lending was primarily lending physical books to local registered patrons
and in addition some Inter Library Loan (ILL). E-lending to local registered patrons of
academic libraries is something that STM publishers have no problem with: Thieme have
negotiated cross-border e-lending agreements with individual libraries, library consortia
(national, regional or local), and with Collective Management Organizations for limited forms
of document delivery that in the parlance of the study, could be described also as “e-lending”,
but really is a form of document supply on request. We also have an agreements for example
with the German library consortium “Subito”. The non-commercial supply of individual
journal articles on request is permissible to researchers, students and academics on
preferential terms and for reduced copy fees, while preserving the market for commercial
supply of journal articles at publisher-set rates. Thieme has also negotiated agreements with
public libraries for example www.onleihe.org to enable user to lend a book also
electronically.

B.     Teaching
42. (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain




  NO
  NO OPINION

44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
We have direct licences with universities for the use of our content for illustration for
teaching.



C.     Research

47. (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain




                                                                                             7

  NO OPINION


49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
We have direct licences with universities for the use of our content for research purposes.

D.     Disabilities
50. (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?

  YES – Please explain by giving examples




  NO
  NO OPINION


52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content? How
successful are they?
[Open question]
We offer more than 2000 E-Books – nearly 700 in ePub3 which enable a high accessibility.



E.     Text and data mining
53. (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
  YES – Please explain




  NO – Please explain
Upon request from bona fide non-commercial researchers, publishers are already granting
authorisation for TDM. . We grant licences under standard terms and at no additional cost.
We may also allow TDM for commercial players but different licensing terms would apply..


  NO OPINION

                                                                                              8
55. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]

There is no need for legislation, which is likely to be counterproductive and will likely inure
to the benefit of large US search providers at the expense of European creators and users.
Text and data mining as a licensing proposition has demonstrated the right way of having
clear and specific usage rights that everyone can understand.



57. Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of text
or data mining methods?
[Open question]
Technological and security issues! Text and data mining has implications to our members’
websites and business models. Crawling websites for text and data can adversely impact upon
the security and technical performance of the website. Uncontrolled access requests and
crawling can cause server instability and overload. In this way legitimate services may be
jeopardised and service degradation could ensue to the detriment of all other customers.
Access requests that are not standardised and not coming from known parties could point to
system interference or even espionage.



F.     User-generated content
58. (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting
from the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate
new content on the Internet, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples


  NO
  NO OPINION
59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient
in this context?
  YES – Please explain




  NO – Please explain
Our work benefits from the ISBN. When we create a work based on a pre-existing work,
either we rely on the quotation or parody exception or we clear the necessary rights with the


                                                                                                9
original rightholders. We have always proceeded in this way and believe that no change in
legislation is needed.


  NO OPINION




 IX.      Fair remuneration of authors and performers
73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
  YES – Please explain




  NO – Please explain why
There are already good provisions in place ensuring that contracts are balanced and not
abusive. Contract law is a national competence and we do not see any need to create an EU
contract law covering copyright contracts.
  NO OPINION



  X.      Respect for rights
75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
  YES – Please explain
Publishers could benefit from a “presumption of ownership” based on the assignation of rights
by their authors. This would help them to have a “locus standi” to be able to take legal action
against infringers. We are not in favour of taking action against individuals, but would
support targeting illegal websites.
Websites which infringe copyright may seem “non-commercial”, but there are frequently
signs that these sites are in fact making a considerable amount of money (e.g. advertising).
  NO – Please explain




  NO OPINION

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
                                                                                            10
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
We would find it beneficial if some intermediaries such as advertisers, payment services,
domain name registrars and search engines who benefit from pirate websites and piracy in
general would be encouraged to cooperate more in efforts to stop illegal activities.

77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection
of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain




  NO – Please explain
The balance tilts too much towards infringement and allows ISPs and advertisers to make
money on harm caused to creators.
