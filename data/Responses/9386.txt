   The Swedish Film and TV Industries’ Cooperation Committee
               Public Consultation on the review of EU copyright rules


Name:                   The Swedish Film and TV Industries’ Cooperation Committee

Register ID:            619777413160-93

Type of respondent:     Representatives of producers, distributors, exhibitors and broadcasters.



This document contains the joint response by the Swedish film and TV industry to the EU
Commission’s public consultation on the review of EU copyright rules. The response has been
prepared by the Swedish film and TV industries’ cooperation committee (SFTCC) which is comprised
of the following industry bodies and associations:

       Swedish Film Distributors Association
       Swedish Exhibitors Association
       Swedish Film & TV Producers Association
       Swedish TV industries

Before responding in detail to the questions included in the consultation, we would like to make a
couple of general remarks. Given the originally tight deadline for responding to this consultation and
the leading way in which the questions have been formulated, it appears as if the EU Commission is
trying to rush through a process that in our view lacks credible evidence to even be motivated.
Consumer access to digital content services is booming and the national copyright frameworks as they
currently stand do in themselves neither pose an obstacle to the continued development of the market,
nor to rights clearance covering several territories. If anything is holding the pace of the development
back, it is the continued lack of efficient protection for copyrighted content online.

We oppose any changes to the fundamental features and principals of the copyright legislation which
is a fundamental right protected by key international, European, and national legal instruments – e.g.
the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, Art. 17. It is essential that no laborious legislation project be
launched unnecessarily.




                                                                                                          1
     I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.        Why  is  it  not  possible  to  access  many  online  content  services  from  anywhere  in 
          Europe?   
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation 
of the market through licensing agreements] 
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians – do not enjoy a single
protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights in each
Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the territory of the Member
State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a
country-by-country basis under national law1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming service,
or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for each national
territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position
to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content services can be provided in
several Member States and across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights Management2 should
significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-territorial licences in musical works for online services3;
the structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the
on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e. the
ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep accessing
them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives of the audio-
visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue working towards the
further development of cross-border portability6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access to,
services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that are made
available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online services are available
in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying to access such services across borders.
In some instances, even if the “same” service is available in all Member States, consumers cannot
access the service across borders (they can only access their “national” service, and if they try to
access the "same" service in another Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their
country of residence).

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.

   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with the
clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements between right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of some of
the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7 to increase the cross-
border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to
access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?
NO
The national copyright frameworks as they currently stand do not in themselves pose an obstacle to
rights clearance covering several territories. On the contrary, meeting consumer demand for access to
audiovisual content through digital services is important for generating revenue and ensuring the long-
term financial sustainability of the film and tv industry.
It is essential that no laborious legislation project be launched unnecessarily. These points have also
been brought forward earlier by the Swedish Government in their response to the EU Commission’s
Green paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works in the European Union in 2011.
The Swedish film and tv industry is changing fast – launching new services, developing new business
models and producing fresh content that attract audiences and generate revenues. In this process, the
contractual freedom to organize the distribution of each production is of crucial importance. And it is
becoming even more important as the market develops. For example, the possibility to pre-sell
exclusive distribution rights in different territories, languages and/or on different platforms is often
required for reaching the level of financing needed for new film or tv productions.
However, there are several other factors that are important for developing the digital market for
audiovisual content, creating sound investment conditions and ensuring cross-border accessibility to
digital content services in the Member States. The most important one is the need for a stronger and
harmonized protection of the digital market for content and copyright enforcement across the EU. We
will get back to this point in later questions.


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking to
provide online services across borders in the EU?
NO
The problems faced by service providers are mainly due to illegal competition from sites with pirated
content. However, this is not related to licensing agreements but rather to insufficient protection of
copyright in the digital market.

title) see section VII of this consultation document.

                                                                                                             3
3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] How
often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of
requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned.
[Open question]
As mentioned above, the Swedish film and tv industry is launching new services, developing new
business models and producing fresh content that attract audiences and generate revenues. In some
cases, this includes licensing content for several territories at once. However, it is crucial that the
contractual freedom to organize the distribution of each production is maintained. The national
copyright frameworks as they currently stand do not in themselves pose an obstacle to rights clearance
covering several territories.
4.        If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what would
be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there
reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in question,
you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in
order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European
countries)?
YES
As discussed above, contractual freedom and the possibility of territorial licensing is of crucial
importance for the Swedish film and tv industry. For example, the possibility to pre-sell exclusive
distribution rights in different territories, languages and/or on different platforms is often required for
reaching the level of financing needed for new film or tv productions.


6.      [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why,
even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you
would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in
order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to
access)?
N/A


7.      Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the
Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
NO
Consumer access to digital content services is booming and the national copyright frameworks as they
currently stand do in themselves neither pose an obstacle to the continued development of the market,
nor to rights clearance covering several territories. If anything is holding the pace of the development
back, it is the continued lack of efficient protection for copyrighted content online.




                                                                                                         4
B.       Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised 
         (or not) in digital transmissions? 
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions] 
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital environment is
largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC8 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and
related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in the online
environment are those relating to the protection of software9 and databases10.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders11 which are
essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject
matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise
or prohibit the making of copies12, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the
uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and at the users’ end
– e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to the public/making
available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital
networks13. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.

C.       The act of “making available”  
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the upload,
the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of “making
available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions
arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the
act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the countries where the
content is potentially accessible? in each of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?).
The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a
relevant criterion is the “targeting” of a certain Member State's public14. According to this approach
the copyright-relevant act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are
“targeted” by the online service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in
a specific country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.

   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.

in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
13
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

                                                                                                                 5
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content is
disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
YES
The ‘making available’ right in its current form is sufficiently clear in cross-border situations and
crucial both to the licensing of content but also to enforce the rights holders’ rights against infringers
and online intermediaries. We would like to stress again that we oppose any changes to the features
and principals of the copyright legislation which is a fundamental right protected by key international,
European, and national legal instruments – e.g. the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, Art. 17. It is
essential that no laborious legislation project be launched unnecessarily.
9.       [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the
“making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are
considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or
not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive
relief15)?
YES
We see no reason for ‘clarifying’ the making available right. It is of crucial importance for rights
holders and any limitation of the scope of the making available right could make it difficult to take
legal actions against illegal sites and services located outside the EU but accessible for EU citizens.

D.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation  
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and law) several
reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction
right and the making available right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online use
notably when the two rights are held by different persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights
to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems
for you?
NO
No, this is not of any concern. Consumer access to digital content services is booming and the national
copyright frameworks as they currently stand do in themselves neither pose an obstacle to the
continued development of the market, nor to rights clearance covering several territories.

E.      Linking and browsing  
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another. They are
indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are pending before the
CJEU16 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of a clickable link constitutes an
act of communication to the public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of works
and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache' memory of his

                                                                                                        6
computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU17 as to whether such copies are always covered by
the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive
2001/29/EC.



11.      Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected
under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the rightholder?
YES
Yes, and the current copyright legislation, as well as previous court rulings, provide sufficient clarity
on the matter of linking and browsing.



12.      Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work
or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the
user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the rightholder?
YES
Yes. Streaming from illegal sources is a fast growing problem in Sweden and current developments
indicate that this problem will soon be significantly bigger than illegal download has ever been. It can
also be expected that the rest of Europe will face similar developments. Sites such as Swefilmer.com
and Dreamfilm.se, which illegally stream movies and TV series with Swedish subtitles from servers
located outside the EU, are growing quickly in popularity. There is a widely held belief among the
public that it is 'safe' to stream as a user, meaning that it is not illegal and you therefore don't risk
getting caught as with P2P or bittorrent. A study by Swedish consulting company MediaVision shows
that the use of illegal streaming has grown by 500 percent over the past five years (MediaVision,
Svenska filmkonsumenter under lupp, 2014).

This development continues despite the large number of legal digital services for audiovisual content
that consumers in Sweden have access to. As a consequence, legitimate digital content services
struggle to attract users when there are alternatives with similar ease of use that are completely “free”,
and partly that the willingness to pay for the legal alternatives is undermined. The illegal consumption
leads to substantial revenue losses for the Swedish film industry as a whole, making it difficult to
finance new productions.

This means that the conditions for the creative industries are deteriorating. Yet the EU can best
enhance its support for this sector through more ambitious and concerted protection and enforcement
measures; not through a reform of the copyright framework.

When it comes to streaming from illegal sources, the legislator’s focus should not be on viewing but
on reproduction. It is obvious that the reproduction right of permanent and temporary works needs to
be based on an authorized original. Legal expertise confirms that the exclusive right of reproduction in
Article 2 of the existing Copyright Directive extends to temporary reproductions. The interpretation of
copyright legislation thus must not build on implicit acceptance of recipients’ actions (such as viewing
of illegal streaming services) – as this would be self-contradictory.

The interpretation of legislation also needs to be neutral to different techniques so that the protection
for the creative sector can be upheld independent of new techniques.

Danish copyright legislation proves that requiring authorization for the use or reproduction of an
original does not hinder technological progress. Streaming from illegal sources is significantly lower
in Denmark than in Sweden.



F.       Download to own digital content  
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions
arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling them
or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in the case
of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,
the right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article)18. The issue that arises
here is whether this principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its
effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)19. This raises difficult
questions, notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the
“forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of a second-
hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market
for physical goods).


13.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to
resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
NO
Current copyright legislation is clear on the point that communication to the public and making
available rights are not exhausted, as is the case for distribution of physical copies. The current legal
framework, with an important interplay between the making available right and Article 6(4)(4) of the
Copyright Directive, is an enabler of online business models and the economic viability of offering
films online.
14.    [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital
content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
Enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content would seriously threaten both the rights
holders’ reproduction right and making available right as the concept of “forward and delete” is


18
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
19
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                                8
impossible to preserve in practice. As content services are increasingly based on cloud services, the
issue becomes less and less relevant.

G.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea? 
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties in the
area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights. However, this
prohibition is not absolute20. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made compulsory
or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection
and with the increased opportunities that digital technology provides for the use of content (including
older works and works that otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and
disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being considered21.

licensing of works and other subject matter?

H.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers 
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers, collective
management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser
extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed ‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be
compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are specific to the sector in which they have

20
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
21
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                              9
been developed22, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or
other subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve
the interoperability of such identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database23 should, once
operational, provide a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works
worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition24 was established to develop building blocks for the
expression and management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types of rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub25 is seeking to take such identification systems a step
further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across different sectors.




19.     What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content
sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions
databases?

I.      Term of protection – is it appropriate? 
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time. After the
term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely used by anyone
(in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention26 requires a
minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of
protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).



With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided for in the
EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements, providing for a
term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual
sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of protection.

20.     Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
YES
We consider the current terms of copyright to be appropriate in the digital environment and see no
reason to change them.

Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

     II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other protected
subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a
certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher in a
literature class). At EU level they are established in a number of copyright directives, most notably
Directive 2001/29/EC27.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international law28.
In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and exceptions
can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the
work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the
rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no other
exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)29, these limitations and exceptions are
often optional30, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or as
few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions is
general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and
exceptions included in the EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy
terms and in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only
within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the rights
is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may still require the
authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member State "B")31.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair compensation of
rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate rightholders for the harm
inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are not
obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering
a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for
illustration in an online course given by an university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a
Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the
level of that compensation and who should pay it.

   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
31
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            11
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism to
ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify
that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of
rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether a greater degree of flexibility can be
introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal
certainty, including for the functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's international
obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in
the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
NO
No, the national copyright frameworks as they currently stand do not in themselves pose an obstacle to
the continued development of the market. We oppose any changes to the fundamental features and
principals of the copyright legislation which is a fundamental right protected by key international,
European, and national legal instruments – e.g. the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, Art. 17. It is
essential that no laborious legislation project be launched unnecessarily.



22.      Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher
level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
NO
No, as stated above, the national copyright frameworks as they currently stand do not in themselves
pose an obstacle to the continued development of the market.


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
No, as stated above, the national copyright frameworks as they currently stand do not in themselves
pose an obstacle to the continued development of the market.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of
flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
NO
No, as stated above, the national copyright frameworks as they currently stand do not in themselves
pose an obstacle to the continued development of the market.
25.      If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by
national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission,
built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please
explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as
well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

26.     Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
NO
No, this is not of any concern. Consumer access to digital content services is booming and the national
copyright frameworks as they currently stand do in themselves neither pose an obstacle to the
continued development of the market, nor to rights clearance covering several territories.



27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-
border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such
compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

J.         Access to content in libraries and archives 
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of limitations and
exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums, as
well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and archiving32 and
enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject matter in the collections of such
institutions33. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these establishments of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive34.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives envisaged or
whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the same time,
questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and
other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role of licensing and
possible framework agreements between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving 
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of cultural
establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of
fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter.
Most Member States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing for the making of such
preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as
regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of works/subject-matter covered by the
exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may
make). Also, the current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and
archiving publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

K.      Off‐premises access to library collections 
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-matter
(consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises of such
establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and
other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the premises of the library) requires
authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements between universities/libraries and publishers.
Some argue that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the
conditions for, granting online access to collections.

32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide remote access,
including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of research and private
study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when

L.      E – lending 
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs
and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it technically possible for
libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via
networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of the rights
holders to organise such e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and libraries are
currently experimenting with different business models for the making available of works online,
including direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying
to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of
books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across borders, from
institutions such as public libraries?

M.      Mass digitisation 
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as libraries and
archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with an objective to
preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public. Examples are efforts
by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of
historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out
of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce),
which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of
licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the
collecting societies representing authors and publishers on the other35. Provided the required funding is

35
          You will find more information about his MoU on                       the   following    website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .

                                                                                                        16
ensured (digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books
that are currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers).
Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such
licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting society or
the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)36.



40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in
your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements
concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of
commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
NO OPINION


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other types
of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
NO OPINION

N.      Teaching 
Directive 2001/29/EC37 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation limitations
and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would
typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing copies
of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected content on a
smart board without having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation of
this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation at Member States level. The
implementation of the exception differs from Member State to Member State, with several Member
States providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some
argue that the law should provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from
the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for teaching, including
across borders?

NO OPINION



36
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

O.         Research 
Directive 2001/29/EC38 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their national laws

P.      Disabilities  
Directive 2001/29/EC39 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with a disability.
The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at
Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched to increase the
accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the
number of works published in special formats and facilitating their distribution across the European
Union) 40.

The Marrakesh Treaty41 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons who are
blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to
copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make available accessible
format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and
its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of
certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible format copies
across borders).

50.     (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing persons
with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content, including across
borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:] Have
you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in special formats
across the EU?

published in special formats, including across borders?

Q.      Text and data mining 
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics42 are different terms used to describe increasingly
important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing
texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or other
automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights,
patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible through
subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is
made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories
or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to
mine protected works or other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the right
holders for the making of such copies unless such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible
to general public without restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining
activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in particular since text
and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in several different
ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue
go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use content) and
relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial
databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe"
stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the
problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and data
mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by publishers as an outcome of
“Licences for Europe”43. In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no
additional licences should be required to mine material to which access has been provided through a

R.      User‐generated content 
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute content at
little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are developing rapidly,

                                                                                                    21
including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally original
content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and
upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs44. User-generated content (UGC) can thus
cover the modification of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not
necessarily require a creative effort and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some
pre-existing content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.
However, the development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share
content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use
is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to fundamental rights such the
freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe"
stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the
problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of
views were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One view was to say that a
new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as
combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available
(licence schemes concluded between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded
between rightholders and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders
across different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions45.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems when
trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on the Internet,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter through
your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from the way
the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the
Internet, including across borders?
NO OPINION


59.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you experienced
problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)
is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that are
publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through
your service to properly identify these works for online use?

44
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

 III.          Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation exceptions or
limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and photocopying46. Levies are
charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording
equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers,
etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made without
their authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private
use) or through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for
rightholders.

                                                                                                       23
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the copying of
files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an
MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile
phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in
some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by
the service provider already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead
to instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence
fees4748.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of cloud-
based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.



64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the
private copying and reprography exceptions49 in the digital environment?
NO
The current copyright legislation provides sufficient clarity on the matter of private copying and
reprography exceptions in the digital environment. Further, as content services are increasingly based
on cloud services with vast opportunities for direct licensing, the issue is becoming less relevant.
65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that
has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to
private copying levies?50
NO OPINION
66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g. services
based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact
the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders’
revenue on the other?

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in obstacles
to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time, many Member
States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all transactions
irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or
business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments52.

payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods

     IV.       Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights and, in
the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are
few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from authors or performers to
producers53 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or other subject matter is
created in the context of an employment contract54. This is an area that has been traditionally left for
Member States to regulate and there are significant differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial
differences also exist between different sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic benefit of
new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain. Another commonly
raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of
rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the
opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to improve their situation and that action at EU level
is necessary.

     V. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE55 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of intellectual
property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this
text56. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions are still fit to ensure a proper
respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient
to deal with the new challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the
other hand, there are concerns about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the
protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it
cannot be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content
is used for a commercial purpose57. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of intermediaries
in the IP infrastructure58. At the same time, there could be clarification of the safeguards for respect of
private life and data protection for private users.

75.     Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements
of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
YES
The civil enforcement system in the EU must be harmonized across Member States and rendered more
efficient for all kinds of infringements of copyrighted material. Whether the purpose is commercial or
not does not make any difference when it comes to the damage it causes the rights holders.

In Sweden, the supply of digital services for audiovisual content is booming. A large number of
national and international audiovisual content services have been established in recent years, which
has increased the availability and range of television series and feature films. HBO Nordic, Netflix, SF
Anytime, Film2Home, Filmnet, Headweb, iTunes, TV4 Play and Viaplay are just a few examples.

Despite the growing market for audiovisual content online, and a record interest in film, the Swedish
film industry revenues are in decline. According to a recent study from Boston Consulting Group, the
Swedish film industry's total retail revenues from cinema, physical purchases and rental movies,
SVOD and TVOD have fallen by SEK 281 million since 2010 (Boston Consulting Group, Svensk
filmnäring – utveckling, utmaningar & möjligheter, 2014, page 26). The study concluded that
consumption in digital channels is not picking up fast enough to off-set the decline in ‘physical’ sales,
and that an important reason for this is the extensive illegal competition in the form of download and
streaming services for pirated films and television shows. Sites such as Swefilmer.com and
Dreamfilm.se, which illegally stream movies and TV series with Swedish subtitles from servers
located outside the EU, are growing quickly in popularity. The current Swedish legislation is not clear
on whether it is illegal to watch streamed films and there is a widely held belief among the public that
it is 'safe' to stream as a user, meaning that it is not illegal and you therefore don't risk getting caught
as with P2P or bittorrent.

of intellectual property rights.

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
57
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
58
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           27
A study by Swedish consulting company MediaVision shows that the use of illegal streaming has
grown by 500 percent over the past five years (MediaVision, Svenska filmkonsumenter under lupp,
2014). This development continues despite the large number of legal digital services for audiovisual
content that consumers in Sweden have access to.

The development has consequences, partly for the legitimate digital content services that struggle to
attract users when there are alternatives with similar ease of use that are completely “free”, and partly
that the willingness to pay for the legal alternatives is undermined. The illegal consumption leads to
substantial revenue losses for the Swedish film industry as a whole, making it difficult to finance new
productions.

Reversing the trend requires a functioning digital market for content all over the EU, protected from
illegal competition. The EU Commission should make it a priority to review the level of enforcement
possibilities in the Member States and take action to ensure that digital content services are given the
same level of protection from illegal competition in the digital market throughout the union, thereby
leveling the playing field.

76.     In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment
service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?
[Open question]

No. As stated above, the current legal framework in Sweden has not been sufficient for the ISPs to
collaborate with rights holders in blocking sites which give illegal access to copyrighted content. The
EU Commission should make it a priority to review the level of enforcement possibilities in the
Member States and take action to ensure that digital content services are given the same level of
protection from illegal competition in the digital market throughout the union, thereby leveling the
playing field.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of
private life and protection of personal data?
YES, but the legal possiblilities for injunctions against ISPs to block illegal sites must be strengthened.

    VI. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate for
quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an objective are
divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of a bundle of national rights.
Some see this as the only manner in which a truly Single Market for content protected by copyright
can be ensured, while others believe that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing a
higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in
Member States’ legal systems.




                                                                                                        28
78.     Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as
a single framework for enforcement?
NO
The creation of a singel EU Copyright Title is not an appropriate solution, since the process would be
both difficult and time-consuming. In view of the fact that the national copyright frameworks do not in
themselves pose a barrier to licensing when it comes to crossborder arrangements, the question could
also be raised of how effective any such solution would be.
79.      Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current
level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
