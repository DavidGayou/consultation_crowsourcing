   The International Federation of Film Distributors’ Associations / Fedération International des
   Associations des Distributeurs de Film (FIAD) represents national organisations of film
   distribution companies whose main activity is the release of cinematographic works in
   cinemas. FIAD’s members cover the entire range of companies: small and medium-sized
   companies specialised in art house films, as well as larger companies focused on mainstream
   films. The members operate in 16 countries where they cover 90 to 100 percent of the
   theatrical market.

   Film distributors are the intermediates between film producers and cinema exhibitors,
   playing an important role in film financing and promotion. Distributors give films the profile
   they deserve with the release in the first – theatrical – window of rights exploitation.
   Depending upon the contracts they have with producers, the distributors may have rights for
   part or all of the following markets: cinema, physical video, video on demand, television and
   internet.

         I.      Rights and the Functioning of the Single Market

   A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
   anywhere in Europe?

   1.      Have you faced problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member
   State other than the one in which you live?
   NO
   It should be noted that there are many national offers that satisfy the current demand for
   audiovisual content. There are also some services available across borders including subscription
   services that allow portability through mobile devices. However, whilst the EU copyright acquis
   allows licensing on a territorial, multi-country, pan-European and global basis, the cultural and
   linguistic diversity present in Europe has established very specific local and national preferences with
   little demand for non-national content. Moreover, multi-territorial services are not easily monetised
   due to the high costs of operating in several territories, resulting in licenses for multiple countries
   being rarely sought after by film distributors.
   The European market for film distribution and exhibition is very unlike the homogenous Chinese and
   US markets. Europe is fragmented, constructed of a variety of different national and local cultures,
   languages and tastes which define consumer preferences. We see this in legacy media consumption,
   as well as evidence suggesting these same patterns are taking place in online consumption.
   Preferences in individual Member States are for national content first, then international
   blockbusters (Hollywood), and finally for non-national and other content. Feature films successfully
   sold to other European countries tend to make just a fraction of the returns obtained in the country
   of origin partly due to a lack of demand and to the high costs of developing specific national
   marketing and release strategies. Even success stories that have crossed borders have still rested
   upon initial high ratings in the country they were produced and released in first. Consumer interest
   can vary based on volatile factors such as fashion, social climate, national events, the general cultural
   ‘zeitgeist’ and even the weather. Unlike other products, a film cannot usually be modified based on
   consumer feedback.
   As a consequence, in most cases, multi-national distribution is not commercially viable. Licensees
   tend to acquire licenses that allow them to provide content in the specific territory they are based.
   The European distribution industry is made up of small and medium sized enterprises, each with
   marketing and distribution expertise to work within a specific national context. Tailored advertising
   and marketing strategies are required, and the timing of release is based on specific national factors,
   events and developments (e.g. release of a new device and/or the local calendar). This is also true for
   new online platforms. Whilst the online environment clearly opens up opportunities for cross-border
   consumption, it does not create the demand that is heavily rooted in cultural diversity. New
   European online service providers tend to be national in scope, focusing on breaking through in
   national markets.
   However, whilst rights are usually sold for a single territory, the current copyright system does not
   prevent the availability of licenses for multiple territories. Rights holders respond to opportunities in
   multiple countries where they exist, such as common linguistic areas including Diaspora
   communities, so long as it is economically viable to do so. The audiovisual industry is developing new
   business models to take advantage of the new opportunities created by technological change and
   online distribution. We are still considering a number of different models and it is unclear whether
   new online opportunities will provide a significant revenue stream. This relies on whether or not the


                                                                                                          3

   new online distribution platforms will share some of the risk by contributing to the pre-financing of
   production. This is the case with the pre-sale of rights to theatrical, home entertainment and
   television distribution channels which currently takes place.
   This question could be misleading because it may lead to the assumption that because there is a lack
   of access, copyright must be the cause. FIAD would like to point out that consumers are faced with
   issues that are not related to licensing. Consumers often experience connection issues when trying to
   access an online service in another Member State. The most prevalent of these issues are non-
   existent or weak internet connections and unexpected service interruptions. Access issues also arise
   from the high costs of internet access.


   2.     Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across borders in
   the EU?
   NO
   As we have explained above, the fragmentation of consumer preferences in Europe have limited the
   capacity of film distributors and service providers to provide content across borders. The limited
   demand for non-national content and the high costs of operating in several territories has meant that
   film distributors and service providers are generally national in scope. However, FIAD would like to
   highlight once more that consumers are generally well served with access to a wide range of services
   and content. New services are becoming available across Europe, reflecting the territorial and local
   nature of demand.
   Some issues do exist for service providers and for film distributors that are not related to licensing.
   For the industry, the viability of developing new business models and services is determined by the
   presence of piracy, VAT rates, micro-payment facilities, consumer protection rules and relevant
   hardware penetration. These raise the costs of providing services whether they are national or multi-
   national in scope.


   3.       How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if
   possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member
   State, the sector and the type of content concerned.
   As already illustrated in question one, licenses covering several territories are not prohibited by the
   current copyright framework. However, intrinsic cultural and linguistic diversity limits the potential
   for cross-border services. The fragmentation of demand in Europe has made it difficult for non-
   national content to cross borders, and it has raised the costs of distribution in multiple territories.
   Therefore, producers rarely grant licenses for multiple territories. Multiple territory licenses are
   usually limited to common linguistic areas where sufficient demand exists to make distribution
   commercially viable. However, this is not to say that cross-border distribution will not improve in the
   future. Whilst demand for non-national content is extremely low, the rise of multilingualism in the
   EU is promising.
   Whilst cultural and linguistic diversity limit the returns from multiple-country distribution, from our
   experience in the market, we see a number of other factors that affect the development of new
   business models. Micro-payment facilities, consumer protection rules and relevant hardware
   penetration all have an effect. Furthermore, the audiovisual industry finds itself on an uneven playing
   field due to the availability online of unauthorised content for free.




                                                                                                        4

   4.     If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above –
   what would be the best way to tackle them?
   The legal infrastructure does not create an obstacle to the cross-border distribution of content. The
   main obstacle is instead the culturally and linguistically diverse consumer preferences that are found
   in Europe and the high costs of distribution in multiple territories. This has limited the requests for
   multi-territorial or pan-European licenses. Nevertheless, consumers are generally well served with
   access to the national content they want.
   In many respects, the market is currently meeting the demand and is working towards developing
   new business models where necessary. For example, in the case of Diaspora communities we have
   been examining new ways to improve access. Whilst this demand is minimal, the progress made in
   Licenses for Europe will work towards alleviating any limitations to access. We also believe that new
   business models enabled by technological breakthrough such as cloud computing could provide
   access for such communities. Furthermore, the industry is looking into technical problems relating to
   geo-location, which could enhance access. The market is already moving in the right direction
   highlighted by the statement signed by the audiovisual industry. This will happen whenever there is a
   new opportunity created by sufficient demand for a particular service.
   There are however several other issues that affect the cost-benefit calculations when developing
   new services that the European Commission could examine. These include VAT rates, micro-payment
   facilities, consumer protection rules, relevant hardware penetration and piracy. The latter is a
   particular concern, as unauthorised content provided for free directly competes with new legal
   services. This distorts the market and undermines film distributors’ return on investment.


   5.      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all
   the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
   restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
   content is not possible in certain European countries)?
   YES
   As explained above, each Member State has different market and regulatory conditions that lead
   naturally to territorial licensing. However, it is also important to understand that territorial licensing
   is also based on a commercial decision. The producer and film distributor will examine the most
   optimal way to respond to local and national consumer preferences.
   Each film is a prototype, and the process of film making is a research and development intensive
   business which involves developing scripts, casting, location, scouting and production design. These
   activities can result in large costs before the first frame of a film has even been shot. In many cases a
   film will be abandoned because of these costs and the loss will be shouldered by the investors. In
   addition, because each film is a prototype it is very difficult to predict consumer interests which are
   often based on unpredictable factors such as social climate, fashions, the cultural ‘zeitgeist’ or even
   the weather. Only one in ten films actually makes a return on their investment.
   With high levels of finance needed and given the high risk involved, most productions will involve
   several investors from within the value chain and outside. Local film distributors are one of these
   entities, partly financing the production process through guarantees. Producers will sell the
   distribution rights by platform, language and/or territory to local film distributors specialised in
   marketing and distribution in their territories. This is based on a very specific business model where
   territories are identified specifically based on the local and national culture, and language.
   Furthermore, often territorial exclusivities will be granted to the film distributors in return for their
   significant investments. This system is a form of peer-review and private investors will look at the
   guarantee provided by the film distributor as evidence that they will recoup any investment they


                                                                                                           5

   make. The contractual freedom to organise the financing and future distribution of a film based on
   specific business models is the most optimal way to reach the largest possible audience. This
   financing structure ensures a high level of investment in the production process, contributing to
   European cultural diversity and creating greater choices for consumers.


   7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
   led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
   services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
   holders?
   NO
   The copyright framework does not prevent licensing in multiple territories. The fact that such
   licenses are rare is instead due to cultural and linguistic diversity and the high costs involved in
   distributing in multiple territories. Forcing the industry to change its established and optimal
   business practices based on a demand that does not exist would threaten the industry’s stability.
   Licensing models should be left to the market which is best placed to adapt to varying and evolving
   patterns of consumption. All parties are best served by arms-length commercial negotiations based
   on the principle of contractual freedom and the exclusive rights established and protected by
   copyright law.
   Pursuing legislative initiatives that merely make European content available in multiple territories on
   EU-wide platforms will have very little effect. The only beneficiaries of such a policy would be
   Diaspora communities and even then focusing on these communities would paradoxically reinforce
   cultural separateness. The industry is already developing new business models to improve access for
   these communities where it is commercially viable to do so. Legislative change does not make sense
   when there is no market failure. Any new policy must be based on an understanding of these
   culturally diverse consumption patterns, which are present in legacy media and are evident online.
   But the Commission should also be aware of the dangers posed by introducing pan-European
   licenses. The introduction of a pan-European license would undermine the very financial model
   employed by the industry which has made it so successful. Each film is a prototype and the process of
   film making is a research and development intensive business that involves developing scripts,
   casting, location, scouting and production designs. These activities can result in large costs before the
   first frame of a film has even been shot. In many cases a film will be abandoned because of these
   costs and the loss will be shouldered by the investors. In addition, because each film is a prototype it
   is very difficult to predict consumer interests that are often based on unpredictable factors such as
   social climate, fashions, the cultural ‘zeitgeist’ or even the weather. Only one in ten films actually
   makes a return on their investment.
   With high levels of finance needed and given the high risk involved, most productions will involve
   several investors from within the value chain and outside. Producers will sell the distribution rights
   by platform, language and/or territory to local film distributors specialised in marketing and
   distribution in their territories. This will be based on specific business models which identify the
   demand in specific territories and are based on the specific national culture and language. This
   system is a form of peer-review and private investors will look at the guarantee provided by the film
   distributor as evidence that they will recoup their investment. The flexibility of the current
   framework allows the development of business models around specific national market factors and
   cultural and linguistic specificities. Furthermore, the territorial exclusivity often granted to film
   distributors in return for high levels of investment ensures productions are adequately financed.
   The contractual freedom to organise the financing and future distribution of a film based on specific
   business models is the most optimal way to reach the largest possible audience. This financing
   structure ensures a high level of investment in the production process. Therefore, when examining

                                                                                                          6

   the opportunities that exist from the digital shift, it is important not to look at territoriality in
   isolation; without it, productions will attract less financing which could mean many distinct and
   economically- and culturally-significant productions are never produced. For a sector that had a
   turnover of €129 billion in 2010, was served by 126,000 SMEs and employed 560,000 people, any
   policy that could reduce investment in such an important European sector should be avoided.1
   Moreover, the introduction of pan-European licensing could undermine cultural diversity in Europe
   by leading to the homogenisation of language and culture. Very few platforms will be able to afford
   the acquisition and market costs of pan-European distribution which are particularly high in Europe
   due to specific market and regulatory differences. This would create commercial pressure to identify
   productions closest to a common cultural denominator. Under Articles 62 and 167(2)3 of the TFEU
   the Commission is required to “contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States,
   while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common
   cultural heritage to the fore.” This was also recognised in the Council Decision in 2006, which
   adopted the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural
   Expressions. Introducing pan-European licenses could undermine this important responsibility.
   We are aware that some US content aggregators are supportive of the removal of the territorial sale
   of film so that they can purchase content at a lower cost. The consequences could be the
   monopolisation of the market by those with greater purchasing power that tend to be US companies.
   This will be to the detriment of the many European SMEs as they try to compete with the larger,
   more heavily funded US companies.
   Consumers generally have access to the content they want on a variety of linear and non-linear
   platforms. Where demand for content across borders does exist, the market is moving in the right
   direction. More and more, the audiovisual sector is investing in new online distribution channels that
   complement existing linear channels. This growth is encouraging and provides consumers with a
   wider choice of content. We have taken steps to improve the access to content for Diaspora
   communities, highlighted by the steps taken during Licenses for Europe.
   However, this is not to say that the European Commission has no role to play. Whilst changes to the
   legal infrastructure are not the answer, the continued development of successful business models
   that provide culturally diverse content across borders is often affected by other factors. As explained,
   these include micro-payment facilities, consumer protection rules and relevant hardware
   penetration, VAT rates, and piracy. Furthermore, national and European funding mechanisms are
   also important. The new Creative Europe programme and the 60 percent ceiling for difficult cross-
   border films introduced into the Cinema Communication are important steps in that regard.
   It is the creativity and innovation of the audiovisual sector which drives the production and
   distribution across borders of content. The future development of the European film industry will
   depend on these qualities, and policy should focus on supporting the industry rather than inhibiting
   its development.

   B.    Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to
   be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

   1.        The act of “making available”


   8.    Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
   content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
   YES
   The scope of the “making available” right is sufficiently clear as it covers both the place of
   transmission and where the content is accessed. The exclusive right was set out in Article 8 of the
   WIPO Copyright Treaty 1996, subsequently integrated into the Information Society Directive
   2001/29/EC, and clarified in a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).4 The scope
   is intended to be flexible and cover both individualised streaming or downloading, and the
   transmission of that work to the public “in such a way that members of the public may access them
   from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.” 5
   The making available right is technologically neutral and demonstrates the different circumstances
   and processes involved in rights exploitation online. The inclusive scope of the right shapes both
   licensing practices and the court jurisdiction and applicable law when dealing with cross-border
   infringement of rights. The current scope of the making available right has benefitted our members
   and encouraged the creation of new and innovative business models for the exploitation of films
   online.
   A recent study by the European Commission suggests that the making available right is unclear and
   leads to legal uncertainty. The study considers a number of alternative solutions to this problem,
   including the application of the country of origin principle. However, it finds that these alternatives
   could create “new bottlenecks,” even more legal uncertainty and would require significant
   harmonisation of copyright law in other areas. Furthermore, the study ignores enforcement against
   intermediaries.6 Changing the scope by implementing any of these alternative approaches is
   therefore not advisable, as it could completely undermine an important right which our members
   rely on. Such a change would undermine the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms.
   From a licensing point of view we would also like to emphasise that the country of origin principle in
   particular is not a viable alternative. This would be modelled on the same principle applied under the
   Cable and Satellite Directive 93/83/EEC. However, we need to only look at the Cable and Satellite
   Directive to recognise that the country of origin principle will not create pan-European distribution of
   content. European broadcasting services have been extremely successful, but this success is based on
   their ability to meet real consumer demand, which is rooted in local and national culture and
   language. The demand for pan-European services is limited and difficulties in monetising these
                                                                                                          7
   services has prevented their establishment. This was highlighted in the KEA Study in October 2010,
   which illustrated that channels of international scope are limited to some information, adult-content
   and minority-language channels.

   9.       Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have an
   effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or
   not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your
   remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive
   relief)?
   YES
   Any attempted change which would undermine the current scope of the making available right
   should be avoided. In particular, extending the Cable and Satellite Directive’s country of origin
   principle to online would be particularly damaging to an important right that is protected by the
   Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and enshrined in the WIPO Copyright Treaty.
   This would limit the scope for enforcing the making available right, which is an important tool in the
   development of the digital world.
   In the audiovisual sector, all the necessary rights are generally held by the producer. Determining the
   author is therefore irrelevant to the financing, production and distribution of a film. Therefore, there
   are few issues with the making available right. Nevertheless, the freedom to manage audiovisual
   content both territorially and chronologically is crucial. Contractual and commercial freedom allows
   the rights holder to exploit their work in the most optimal way and is an important mechanism in the
   audiovisual industries financing model.
   The broad scope of the making available right is also important for the protection and enforcement
   of intellectual property rights. The court cases outlined in this document demonstrate the important
   role played by the current scope of the “making available” right. In Football Dataco v Sportradar, the
   decision recognised that online infringement can involve multiple and shifting servers, which can be
   elusive, anonymous and often located outside of the EU. Often, a rights holder will bring proceedings
   against an intermediary based on Article 8(3) of the Copyright Directive when the server is difficult to
   locate. To do this requires evidence that the subject is an intermediary and that a third party has
   used that intermediary to infringe copyright. Under the country of origin principle, it is much harder
   to satisfy this second criterion. If the server is elusive or based outside of the EU in a country with
   weak protections for copyright, successfully enforcing copyright is extremely difficult. The country of
   origin would lead to a race to the bottom. However, the targeted approach allows rights holders to
   seek jurisdiction in different European Member States, which allows them to ensure protection
   against unauthorised use of their content.
   The judgement raises questions about measures which would limit this scope of the making available
   right. We would like to highlight the Commission’s role in upholding the EU Charter of Fundamental
   Rights and Freedoms. The institutions are required to protect intellectual property under Article
   17(2). Any derogation from this would undermine the Charter. Whilst we recognise that this is not an
   absolute right, the country of origin principle would cause significant damage to this right. Limiting
   the scope of the right could lead to the complete collapse of copyright protection.
   For enforcement reasons, it is important to maintain the current scope of the making available right.
   Ensuring adequate financing and a level playing field in the distribution of audiovisual content is vital
   to the development of the digital single market, as it will encourage innovative new services and the
   production of diverse and imaginative content to serve consumer needs. Furthermore, limiting such
   a right would undermine European jurisprudence and EU law. In our opinion, the CJEU is best placed
   to interpret EU law and provide clarity. This is evident from its recent rulings, which are referenced in
   this document. Any limitation to the making available right must respect the Three-Step Test as
   established in international copyright treaties.

   2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


   10.    Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the
   online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?
   NO
   We do not perceive any issues when applying both the making available right and reproduction right.
   Unlike the music industry where rights can often be fragmented amongst multiple rights holders, in
   the audiovisual sector all the necessary rights are usually held by the producer. Determining who
   holds the reproduction right and who holds the making available right is therefore not an issue. The
   Commission has recognised this important distinction in a 2009 Reflection Paper.8 The Collective
   Rights Management Directive will alleviate the unique issues that exist in the music sector.
   We also disagree that the reproduction right and the making available right should be considered as
   a single act of economic exploitation. Reproduction rights are important in the act of uploaded copies
   to a platform’s server or to a consumer’s device. The separate forms of reproduction by the
   consumer and end user should not be confused and thought of as falling into a single act of economic
   exploitation.
   Therefore, legislative intervention to create a unitary right would not be advised as it could limit the
   scope of the reproduction and making available rights. Such action would only serve to undermine
   the freedom of the producer to license their works in a flexible and optimal way. Furthermore, any
   restriction on the protection of exclusive rights would be in direct violation of the EU Charter and
   relevant international treaties. Article 10 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty, Article 13 of the TRIPs
   Agreement and Article 9 of the Berne Convention prohibit removing a right which provides an
   important protection for exclusive rights, unless within the confines of the three-step test. There are
   no foreseeable alternatives which would be justified under this test.




   3.        Linking and Browsing

   11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
   protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
   the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES
   The provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject-matter protected under copyright
   should be subject to the authorisation of the rights holder as set out in current legislation and by the
   CJEU. Hyperlinking plays an important part in the dissemination of online content, and an exclusion
   of copyright protection in this area would drastically undermine both existing licensing practices and
   copyright protection for rights holders.
   The legal base can be found in Article 3 of the Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain
   aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society, which lays out the rights holder’s
   exclusive right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public. The Article leaves flexibility
   for the implementation of this right in national level legislation. In Article 4 of the same Directive,
   Member States are to provide for authors the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit any form of
   distribution to the public. This distribution right is not exhausted, except where the first sale or other

   transfer of ownership is made by the rights holder or with his consent. The distribution right thus
   remains with the original rights holder, unless he or she decided to sell this right.
   Apart from the legal base, the jurisprudence provided by the CJEU and national courts in a number of
   verdicts in the past provides some clarity in cases of linking to copyrighted content. The recent
   Svensson decision recognises that links to protected works do constitute an act of communication or
   “making available” to the public, irrespective of the type of link. We do have some concerns
   regarding the effects of this case and the introduction of a “new” public criterion. Nevertheless, we
   expect further clarification in the upcoming decision on the C More Entertainment and BestWater
   International cases.
   The existing flexibility provided by the CJEU is necessary because it makes it possible to judge
   individual cases and ensures the framework does not become outdated by technological
   developments. Since the 2001 Directive leaves enough room for technological developments, and
   the CJEU provides clarification where this is needed, FIAD does not see legislative changes as
   required.
   Obviously, linking is inherent in diffusing information on the internet and we firmly believe that the
   online world helps to promote creativity and cultural diversity. It is in the interest of civil society in its
   broadest sense to have a creative and cultural presence online. However, to keep Europe’s creative
   and cultural industries sustainable, as well as to ensure that cultural diversity is maintained, the right
   to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public - including the making available of owned
   works – should remain with the rights holder exclusively, as provided for in the 2001 Directive.
   Therefore, any provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject-matter protected under
   copyright as defined by current legislation and by the CJEU must be authorised by the rights holder.


   12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
   a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
   memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
   subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES
   The viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other subject
   matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer
   should, in general, be subject to the authorisation of the rights holder.
   Like in the case of linking to copyrighted content, the right to commission any reproduction, long-
   term or transient, is based exclusively with the rights holder. Article 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC makes
   clear that this right also extends to temporary reproductions. Article 5 on the harmonisation of
   certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society distinguishes ‘caching’ as a
   ‘transient’ reproduction of a work that enables web-browsing. We agree that at the moment it is an
   inherent feature of the internet. Since this leaves some room for interpretation for courts, we believe
   that the Directive gives a sufficient provision for the possibility of authorising caching.
   With the swift technological developments of the past decade in mind, we think that the
   supplementary jurisprudence provided by the CJEU clarifies temporary reproductions of copyright-
   protected content. The jurisprudence indicates that in general caching of copyrighted audiovisual
   content can only be lawful, as long as the whole process was lawful. If caching, or another form of
   reproduction needed for web-browsing, of copyrighted subject-matter is part of the action of piracy
   or other infringement of the rights holder’s rights, it should be able to take immediate and firm
   action to stop the infringement.

   4.        Download to own digital content

   13.   Have you faced restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have
   purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
   NO
   FIAD does not see the fact that consumers cannot resell digital content they download as an
   “excessive disadvantage”. Current licensing arrangements, based on the making available right,
   permit certain uses but prohibit the resale of a digital file. Consumers are made aware of these
   contractual terms in advance. Consumers generally have a wide degree of freedom with few
   limitations on personal use and they have the ability to download content to multiple devices.
   These contractual terms are also necessary to ensure business models are sustainable and
   consumers have access to the content they want. The fact that so many on-demand offers exist is
   due to the terms and conditions of specific licensing agreements. These specificities ensure flexibility,
   as film distributors can supply access based on specific consumption needs. For example, a consumer
   will have a choice of options, such as access to content from the cloud, choice of either long term or
   short term rental and the ability to view only or download a work. The current legislation ensures
   this flexibility, which facilitates the development of attractive and individualised offers for
   consumers.
   14.    What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the
   resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content)
   concerned.
   Under EU and international law, the principle of exhaustion does not apply to the right to
   reproduction or the making available right. This principle is currently applied to the distribution right
   and plays an important role in the distribution of physical copies and the development of the single
   market. The digital world is different and the exhaustion principle is not so easily applied.
   Juridical clarifications in the UsedSoft9 and TV Catchup10 cases have so far failed to justify the
   extension of this principle. For example, the former case concerns computer programs under the
   Software Directive 2009/24/EC and cannot be applied to other audiovisual works. Unlike physical
   distribution, in the online environment the making available right and reproduction right are
   involved, neither of which is exhausted under EU and international law. When a physical copy is
   transferred, the single copy moves from one person to another. In the online world, a unique
   practice of transfer takes place whereby a new perfect copy is made whilst the original owner is able
   to keep his/her own copy. Under international law,11 exhaustion of the distribution right is permitted,
   though exhaustion of the making available right and right to reproduction is prohibited. This is
   introduced into the EU copyright acquis, for example, where the making available right is protected
   from exhaustion by Articles 3.3. Therefore, preventing rights holders from prohibiting the resale of
   content would undermine both EU and international law.
   Any limitation to the scope of exclusive rights must comply with the three-step test. Compliance in
   this case is unlikely, given that “digital exhaustion” would clearly conflict with the second step
   concerning the exploitation of a work. The normal online distribution of a film in the primary market
   would face an unlevel playing field, competing against cheaper second-hand files in a situation of
   pure price competition. Unlike physical copies, there is little to distinguish new and used copies, as
   there is no change in quality after first consumption. We can also expect other negative market

   effects similar to what we observe in the video games industry. Due to unfair competition, rights
   holders would need to adapt their business model to take into account the losses caused by digital
   exhaustion. One consequence is that the price of a film will increase dramatically for the first sale.
   However, there will also be far greater consequences because of the release window structure on
   which film distributors base their exploitation. This model enables a longer life-cycle for a film than it
   does for video games where sales are usually concentrated in a small period of time. For film, the
   late windows are similar to second hand sales and prices are lower. Introducing an exhaustion
   principle would completely undermine the exploitation in these later windows, reducing revenues
   and raising questions about their sustainability. Therefore, the damage caused to film distributors
   and rights holders by changing the exhaustion principle would be far too high to comply with the
   three-step test.
   Furthermore, the idea that technical fixes can ensure that online resale replicates the physical world
   is unfounded. The idea of a regime of digital exhaustion based on “forward and delete” is
   unenforceable, as it would be impossible to verify whether the user reselling a file deletes the
   original file after it has been resold. Such a regime has no place in an environment based on licensing
   access to protected works and cloud based services.
   The current EU rules on the exhaustion principle are clear and recognise the differences inherent in
   the physical and digital channels of distribution. The application of this principle would raise concerns
   regarding its compliance with EU law, international law, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and
   national constitutions. As outlined in the first question, the current contractual terms support a
   diversity of business models providing consumers with a variety of different offers. Furthermore,
   allowing the resale of digital content would create an unlevel playing field, competing directly with
   film distributors and forcing them to rethink their business models. If the online market is to develop,
   rights holders must retain the ability to manage and develop new business models based on creative
   licensing.




   C.        Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?

   15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification
   and licensing of works and other subject matter?
   NO
   We believe that the market is already making significant progress in developing publicly accessible
   registries and databases that facilitate access to information about audiovisual works and right
   holders. For example, the internationally-recognised identifiers, the International Standard
   Audiovisual Number (ISAN, www.isan.org) and the Entertainment Identifier Registry (EIDR,
   www.eidr.org) demonstrate the steps the sector has already taken to ease the identification of works
   and improve public access to information concerning right holders in the digital environment.
   We would like to underline the importance of ensuring that any identification or registration system
   remains voluntary in nature.


   16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
   We support the Commission’s aim of facilitating the identification of works, and we suggest that
   existing identifiers such as ISAN and EIDR contain the necessary features of cost-effectiveness and
   flexibility. It is also important for any identification system of films and other audiovisual content to
   be reliable, secure, and have in place effective measures to prevent the misappropriation of rights.

                                                                                                          13
International Federation of Film Distributors' Associations (FIAD)
www.fiad.eu
   We believe that it is essential to allow the market to continue to develop voluntary and practicable
   solutions to facilitate the identification of audiovisual works.


   17.       What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
   It is essential that such a system provide a reliable and secure service in order to prevent the risk of
   abuse and the misappropriation of rights.


   18.       What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
   Any incentives for registration to right holders would need to come from the benefits inherent in the
   registration system itself.




   D.        How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

   19.   What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
   content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
   and permissions databases?
   The topic of identifiers is of importance to FIAD. An active back-catalogue is crucial for film
   distributors and other right holders in generating the valuable financing necessary to help develop
   new films. It is therefore advantageous for all participants in the film value chain to ensure that
   information about rights acquisition terms are easily accessible by potential licensees and that the
   licensing process itself is expedient and transparent.
   FIAD therefore supports the use of international identifiers designed to facilitate the identification of
   audiovisual works, such as the International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN) and the
   Entertainment Identifier Registry (EIDR).
   We do not, however, believe there is a need for further EU intervention in this area, such as creating
   centralised universal databases to act as automated marketplaces or clearinghouses. Such projects
   are cumbersome and burdensome to update, as rights ownership tends to migrate over time and
   require constant tracking.




   E.        Term of protection – is it appropriate?

   20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
   environment?
   YES
   We would like to recall Directive 2011/77/EU on the term of protection of copyright and certain
   related rights, which extended the term of protection for music performers and producers. This
   extension was not applied to the audiovisual sector, nor was such an extension considered by the
   Commission due to the significant cultural and commercial differences between the music and
   audiovisual sectors. This situation has not changed, and FIAD would therefore argue that this status
   quo should be maintained.


                                                                                                         14
International Federation of Film Distributors' Associations (FIAD)
www.fiad.eu
   All creative content however, whether in the digital or offline environments, involves a significant
   financial investment from film distributors and other right holders. This investment represents a risk
   and requires a sufficient period of time to allow creators to recoup their investments, which may
   take years, even in cases of success. Adapting to the digital age should certainly not involve any
   shortening of the terms of protection. FIAD sees no reason for the term of copyright protection to
   differ in the digital and offline environments, nor why the current terms of protection, which have
   become an accepted international norm, would need to be shortened. This would be in conflict with
   the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights (Art. 17) which guarantees the right to private property,
   including intellectual property.




        II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

   21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
   provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
   NO
   The optional nature of the exceptions and limitations set out by the 2001 Copyright Directive
   provides a sufficient level of harmonisation between the EU Member States while respecting
   subsidiarity and allowing for an appropriate degree of flexibility in terms of implementation. We
   believe that such flexibility is an asset rather than a disadvantage. In cases where clarification is
   needed, the three-step test and European case law act as useful tools to ascertain whether a fair
   balance between consumers and right holders is achieved and to make sure that exceptions are
   uniformly interpreted.


   22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
   a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
   NO
   The current flexible system of limitations and exceptions provides a practical framework for Member
   States, which is an asset rather than a disadvantage – there is no shortage of new content being
   created throughout the EU. The diverse legal systems and cultural traditions of the Member States
   would make it impractical and unnecessary to impose mandatory exceptions, while, as mentioned
   above, the three-step test and European case law are useful and pragmatic tools to ensure a fair
   balance between consumers and right holders and a uniform interpretation of exceptions.


   23.     Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
   existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
   FIAD believes there is no sound legal evidence to support the addition or removal of any exceptions
   or limitations to the existing catalogue. The current framework provides a practical framework which
   respects the diverse cultural and legal traditions of the EU, and which allows practical steps to be
   taken when issues requiring attention arise – e.g. the Orphan Works Directive and the Collective
   Rights Management Directive.




                                                                                                      15
International Federation of Film Distributors' Associations (FIAD)
www.fiad.eu
   24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
   degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
   NO
   Flexibility is a crucial element of the copyright framework. The current system, supported by EU case
   law and the three-step test, respects subsidiarity and allows Member States to implement limitations
   and exceptions according to their diverse national cultures and legal systems.
   Under the current framework there is no shortage of new content being created, and existing
   legislation such as the Copyright and E-Commerce Directives have allowed new services and
   technologies to develop and flourish in the digital environment. We therefore suggest that the
   current regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions provides a sufficient level of flexibility.


   25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
   interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives,
   interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair
   dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative
   advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the
   functioning of the Internal Market.

   We would argue that introducing a fair use or fair dealing provision would not be compatible with
   the legal traditions of the EU Member States, and could in fact lead to legal uncertainty – the US will
   assess fair use cases on an individual basis, which would be a practical cause for concern. Existing
   mechanisms within the EU such as the three-step test already provide a sufficient degree of
   flexibility.

   26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
   a problem?
   NO
   Since copyright is territorial in nature, it follows that limitations and exceptions will follow suit.
   Whether a limitation or exception is relevant to a particular act of exploitation is a question for the
   law of the Member State where protection is sought (which generally is where the use in question is
   taking place). We are not aware that this constitutes a problem and also have not seen any evidence
   or impact assessments that have indicated any problems.


   27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
   have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
   when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
   In this event, the question of fair compensation would be addressed in the Member State where the
   use occurs. This is in accordance with international norms and EU law.




                                                                                                       16

   A.        Access to content in libraries and archives

   1.        Preservation and archiving

   28.    (a) Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use an exception to
   preserve and archive specific works or other subject matter in your collection?
   (b) Have you experienced problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments,
   museum or archives of the preservation exception?
   NO
   29.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
   In FIAD’s view, for any success in achieving extensive preservation of and greater access to European
   cinematographic heritage works, there has to be a close collaborative relationship between rights
   holders, European film heritage institutions, and other relevant parties when and where applicable. It
   is felt that any problems encountered in the use of the preservation exception are adequately dealt
   with through close co-operation between the parties involved, or at least to the extent that
   legislation is unneeded.
   We emphasis in particular the good work achieved in Working Group 3 of the Licenses for Europe
   stakeholder dialogue, of which FIAD held observer status, where audiovisual rights holders and
   institutional users pledged to co-operate closely in order to facilitate the digitisation of and access to
   European cinematographic heritage works.
   One legislative development that we welcome is that relating to a diligent search as set out in the
   Orphan Works Directive. The provisions relating to diligent search contained in this Directive are
   highly valued, and we feel that a diligent search as an ideal is something to be applauded and kept in
   mind when searching for solutions to any problems experienced in the archiving of audiovisual
   content.
   Furthermore, we advocate the continued application of the three-step test to any solution adopted
   in this area, as we feel that the three-step test is a useful and proven tool for protecting the interests
   of rights holders.


   30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
   elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
   which conditions?

   FIAD would like to emphasise that a legislative solution is not the best manner in which to solve any
   issues encountered with the use of the preservation exception by libraries, educational
   establishments, museums or archives. We would refer you to the detail contained in our answer to
   question 29 of this consultation.

   31.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
   As noted in our response to question 29 of this consultation, we believe that a solution drawing upon
   a close collaborative relationship between rights holders, European film heritage institutes, and
   other relevant parties when and where applicable is the best solution to any problems encountered
   in the use of the preservation exception by institutions. In the past, rights holders have used similar
   contracts with archives and can be used again in the future with the possible assistance of
   stakeholder dialogues.


                                                                                                          17

   2.        Off-premises access to library collections

   32.     (a) Have you experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements
   with rights holders that enable you to provide remote access, including across borders, to
   your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
   (b) Have you experienced specific problems when trying to consult, including across
   borders, works and other subject-matter held in the collections of institutions such as
   universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of the institutions in
   question?
   (c) Have you negotiated agreements with institutional users that enable those institutions
   to provide remote access, including across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in
   their collections, for purposes of research and private study?
   NO

   33.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
   FIAD has some concerns regarding remote access and feels certain safeguards are necessary.
   Foremost, the library should undertake a detailed assessment into the effect remote access could
   have on licensing agreements already in place. Any competition should be avoided that would
   undermine a rights holders and film distributors’ ability to fully exploit a work. It is also important to
   determine who the owner of a digital copy is when both a library and rights holder has digitised a
   film. In this area, we largely welcome and appreciate the framework of guidelines that were set up in
   this area as part of the discussion in Working Group 3 of the recent Licenses for Europe stakeholder
   dialogue. This market-led solution comprehensively tackles these important issues.
   Another area of concern for FIAD is the potential increase in piracy that could result from remote
   access. We fear that outside of the controlled environments of library reading rooms and university
   computer clusters, it is more difficult to control the use of collections accessed by users. There is a
   danger that unauthorised and high-quality copies will be made.


   34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
   elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
   which conditions?
   FIAD does not personally feel that a legislative solution would be the best means to tackle any
   problems in this area, and would refer to answer question 33 of this consultation.

   35.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
   We believe that a solution drawing upon a close collaborative relationship between rights holders,
   European film heritage institutes, and other relevant parties when and where applicable is the best
   solution to any problems encountered in off premises access to library collections. In the past, rights
   holders have developed similar contracts with archives, which can be used again in the future with
   the possible assistance of stakeholder dialogues. Further details can be found by referring to
   question 33.

   3.        E – lending

   36.   (a) Have you experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements to
   enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or other
   materials held in your collection?
   (b) Have you experienced specific problems when trying to borrow books or other
   materials electronically (e-lending), including across borders, from institutions such as
   public libraries?
   (c) Have you negotiated agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or other
   materials electronically, including across borders?
   NO


   37.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
   FIAD believes that if problems exist for rights holders and libraries with regard to electronic lending
   of audiovisual material, the market is best placed to address these. Licenses are currently available
   for libraries and collecting societies and market-led solutions will appropriately deal with any
   possible future problems. Flexible licensing can strike a balance between protecting the rights of
   rights holders, as well as enabling the public to borrow works through libraries for a defined period of
   time. We insist that the rights of rights holders should remain exclusively with them, and cover the
   entire copyright of an audiovisual work. These rights should not be reduced to a mere right to
   remuneration. Strong copyrights are needed to guarantee the existence of the creative and cultural
   industries, which are valuable to the European economy, as well as to cultural diversity. We
   therefore see no need for a change in this respect in EU-level legislation.


   38.    What differences do you see in the management of physical and online collections,
   including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
   39.    What difference do you see between libraries’ traditional activities such as on-
   premises consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises (online, at a
   distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?

   FIAD and its members are very much in favour of the most diffuse distribution of film to European
   citizens as possible. Libraries provide the public with copyrighted works for a certain fee and under
   certain conditions that are plainly laid out in Article 2 of the Directive 2001/29/EC on the
   harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Although
   this already creates unfair competition for film distributors and other rights holders, licensing
   systems exist for libraries in all member states. These licensing systems are a part of the
   reproduction rights that have been established at the European level.
   Since every film is a prototype, as it has been elaborated on in answers to the previous questions, it
   is impossible to predict the success of a film. Film distributors take a high risk in order to make
   available audiovisual works to the European public, without knowing if their investment will be
   recouped. The use of release windows as a business model, which library licensing systems are a link
   in the chain, is the only way to provide for economic and sustainable distribution of films.
   Changing the library exception would circumvent the well-working reproduction right, harming film
   distributors who form an essential part in the dissemination of copyrighted audiovisual material. A


                                                                                                        19

   change in the library exception – where the reproduction right is circumvented – would mean that
   libraries get an economic advantage over other outlets for audiovisual content that are part of the
   business model of the producers of creative works. By letting a library member stream films for free
   at home, a library’s online database would function as a free video-on-demand (VoD) platform.
   We certainly see differences between libraries’ traditional activities and more modern undertakings,
   such as enabling off-premises consultation and e-lending. Off-premises access and e-lending increase
   the risk of unauthorised copying of material by individuals, since there are fewer restrictions that
   withhold potential pirates from doing so. FIAD members would like to ensure that its members’
   rights are protected under any circumstance and thinks that the 2001 Directive is sufficient in
   providing such protection with regard to exceptions for libraries. A change in these exceptions could
   mean a serious hampering of cultural diversity in the European Union.




   B.        Teaching

   42.     (a) Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other
   subject-matter for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
   (b) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which works or other
   subject-matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
   43.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
   44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
   illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
   45.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
   elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
   what conditions?
   46.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
   NO
   FIAD support the use of films in education as they are an important cultural medium which should be
   explored in the same way as literature. In our view, the current copyright framework is designed to
   promote the use of films in education as well as providing the necessary flexibility to address
   emerging issues such as distance learning and examinations which are currently setting the future
   agenda for the European education policy. Articles 5 and 6 of the Copyright Directive ensure there is
   a balance between the exception and licensing solutions. Educational institutions are permitted to
   use clips of works for “illustration” but a license must be sought for the use of an entire film. The
   framework sets these measures for both face-to-face and distance learning.
   This distinction is important as it defines the exception within the bounds of the three-step test. If
   the scope of the exception were extended the exception would fail the second step. Allowing a film
   to be accessed remotely by distance learners would conflict with the normal exploitation of a work
   by the rights holder. Such a provision would challenge the business models of commercial VOD and
   other home entertainment channels. Furthermore, some films are produced specifically for
   educational use and a film distributor’s revenue is reliant solely upon the agreement reached with
   the institution. By allowing an exception for an entire film their business model becomes
   unsustainable threatening the entire foundations of educational production. The current scope



                                                                                                      20

   therefore allows distributors to conduct arms-length negotiations which include quality controls and
   important technological measures.




   C.          Disabilities

   50.    (a) Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content, including across
   borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
   (b) Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
   special formats across the EU?
   (c) [Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the application of limitations or
   exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication of works published in special
   formats, including across borders?
   51.         If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
   52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
   How successful are they?
   NO
   We support practical solutions that will allow disabled users to have access to audiovisual content.
   Special subtitling and audio description tools are increasingly made available by film distributors.
   Moreover, the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC contains several provisions which facilitate access.
   Article 5(3)b allows different kinds of uses and provides a flexible approach that can be adapted to
   different categories of copyright works, forms of distribution and to the particular needs of the
   disabled. A new separate mandatory obligation to make content available in a particular format
   would be incompatible with technological developments and the current and future needs of
   individual disabled users. Individual and flexible contractual solutions are the most effective means
   of improving the accessibility of audiovisual content for users with disabilities.




        III.      Private copying and reprography

   64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
   the private copying and reprography exceptions12 in the digital environment?
   NO
   The current Directive is clear whilst allowing a necessary degree of flexibility for Member States. This
   is supported by recent case law which has provided adequate clarification. In Article 5.2(b) an
   exception takes effect for a reproduction that is made “on any medium” for private use, not directly
   or indirectly commercial, and as long as rights holders are fairly remunerated. Copies made by a third
   party or legal entity, for a third party or legal entities, or within legal entities are prohibited.
   Furthermore, conditions are introduced to protect rights holders for example by stating that the
   reproduction must come from a legal source and must adhere to the three-step test. Finally, Member
   States are required to implement legal protection of technological measures.

International Federation of Film Distributors' Associations (FIAD)
www.fiad.eu
   In the digital environment, efficient and cost effective licensing solutions are available. Technology
   and content management solutions that include direct payment to rights holders offer efficiency and
   reduced costs, invariably negating the need for levies. This is demonstrated in the cloud and digital
   lockers, where legal copies will be licensed copies and, therefore, no levies are necessary.


   65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
   a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
   minimal, be subject to private copying levies?
   NO
   As already illustrated, technology and content management solutions allow digital distribution and
   remuneration to be managed successfully. This is demonstrated in the cloud where legal content will
   be licensed content and so levies are not necessary.


   66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
   services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
   devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
   and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

   As FIAD has already demonstrated, current licensing practices that are effectively managed by
   technology and content management solutions are sufficient in the context of online services. In the
   case of the cloud, this is a reality, as legal content will be licensed content and therefore levies are
   not required. Both rights holders and licensees benefit when technological measures facilitate the
   direct exercise of rights. Furthermore, flexible licensing is the most effective means of providing a
   diversity of options for end users. This allows end users a number of choices such as view-only or
   download, and short and long term rentals.


   67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
   subject to levies?
   NO
   Whilst FIAD supports most transparency measures, in this case it is difficult to see how labelling
   would be beneficial. When considering this, it is important to consider whether such a display
   obligation is cost-effective. Considering the unreasonable burden this would place upon the market,
   FIAD would suggest that such a regulation could be particularly damaging not only for rights holders,
   but also for retailers and end-users. Not only will the costs rise for retailers, but users may feel they
   have bought the right to copy a work as they please. This could include making copies from an illegal
   source. It is important that the conditions laid out by the Directive are met.


   68.    Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
   undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the
   free movement of goods or services?
   NO




                                                                                                         22

      IV.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers

   72.    What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you
   receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?

   FIAD fully recognises that remuneration of authors and performers is a legitimate concern that can
   be addressed by a variety of formulas. One potential model is collective bargaining agreements
   reached with trade unions. We would argue, however, that the introduction of a statutory right to
   remuneration subject to mandatory collective licensing would be a disproportionate solution. Under
   such a scheme, Collective Management Organisations (CMOs) administrating the remuneration
   rights would seek payment directly from the platforms that license audiovisual content, regardless of
   the arrangements reached between producers and authors/performers, including collective
   bargaining agreements with unions. As a result, users would have to pay twice for the same content
   and the uptake of online distribution services would be impeded.
   A statutory remuneration right subject to mandatory collective licensing would diminish the value of
   the exclusive right that the producer obtains by operation of law and/or contract. The end result is a
   limitation on the author’s exclusive right, as well as diminishing the value of the rights the author can
   transfer to producers, which is potentially inconsistent with international norms. Collecting societies
   administrating the remuneration rights will seek payment from the platforms, not the production
   companies. This takes money out of the marketplace. Producers and film distributors would find that
   the platforms were willing to pay less for the content; to the extent residuals (the supplementary
   payments over and above the initial lump sum remuneration) were already being paid pursuant to
   individual or collective agreements, authors and performers would be getting double payments.
   Measures to avoid double payment risk further diminishing the value of the author’s exclusive right.
   The existing mechanisms provide upfront remuneration to authors and performers, unlike film
   distributors, who take risks in investing and are required to recoup their investments over a specific
   time period. The current system also allows authors and performers to receive further income from
   secondary or tertiary exploitation. This is a well-established, streamlined system, which should only
   be changed after very careful consideration.
   We believe right holders should not be forced into collective management or licensing agreements,
   except where exclusive rights are subject to mandatory collective administration for practical reasons
   under international law. However, these cases are the exception, rather than the rule.
   Though important in its own right, remuneration of all contributors, be they creators or other
   contributors to the collective work, is only one of the strategic issues pertaining to online distribution
   and the adjustments it will require. Of equal importance is the question of how transactional online
   distribution and publishing can, in the long run, develop the economic capability to be actively
   involved in the financing of new creative content. A mere remuneration model for authors and
   performers for future online distribution would fail to acknowledge the need for a broader return on
   investment necessary to make the audiovisual production, financing and exploitation sector
   sustainable, and to support the very high costs attached to the development, production, marketing
   and distribution of new audiovisual content. Further research and strategic thinking is required in
   this vital aspect of audiovisual policy strategy.
   Any future policy developments must create evidence-based solutions to concrete problems and
   must not upset the delicately balanced national remuneration schemes.




                                                                                                          23
International Federation of Film Distributors' Associations (FIAD)

   73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
   contracts)?
   NO
   The establishment of an EU-level “national” remuneration right, if subjected to mandatory collective
   licensing, would create yet a further layer of collective management and administration fees. The
   uptake of online distribution services will be handicapped by such an additional layer of
   administration. Such a system would serve further to undermine the value of copyright online by
   fuelling the current misconception that copyright is a mere right to remuneration, leaving the weight
   of the film production pre-financing responsibilities on the “classic” distribution channels (theatrical,
   physical carriers, TV). FIAD agrees with the notion that contractual freedom and personal autonomy
   should be respected and does not see the need to prohibit certain clauses in contracts, for example.




        V. Respect for rights

   75.     Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
   infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
   YES
   FIAD believes that the civil enforcement system in the EU could be rendered more efficient for
   infringements of copyright, and emphasises the importance in achieving this goal due to the
   importance of the cultural and creative industries for the EU. It has been demonstrated that
   copyright infringement and piracy endangers cultural development, jobs and growth. In addition, the
   significant monetary losses as a consequence of massive IPR infringements have a massive negative
   impact on investments, leading to reduced risk appetite in the media industry and making projects
   more difficult or impossible, which leads to overall budget constraints. This in turn has a chilling
   effect on the contribution of European cultural industries to the development of European culture.
   We appreciate the Commission’s efforts to improve the current legal framework on intellectual
   property rights. It is paramount that the Commission promote a sustainable European content
   production and distribution industry, allowing innovative services and products to create growth and
   jobs in Europe.
   The current digital age creates unprecedented opportunities for intellectual property owners and
   other stakeholders, including consumers. However, it also establishes an easy channel for the illegal
   use of copyright protected content that undermines the potential of the industry. Proper
   enforcement does not only support cultural diversity and innovation, but also creates jobs and
   economic growth. As a 2010 official study has shown, the core copyright-intensive industries
   generate 7 million jobs, contribute approximately EUR 509 billion and generate a trade surplus, while
   predicted losses due to copyright infringement piracy may reach by 2015 as much as 1.2 million jobs
   in the EU.13
   Creating more legal alternatives is often mentioned as a tool to address illegal use of copyright
   content. We believe this is just one of the solutions and one that can only flourish if there is a digital
   environment which respects the rule of law and where piracy is combated. This is essential to
   encourage and facilitate legal offers of content to thrive online and to provide the incentive to create
   new, innovative digital content services. For film distributors, piracy drastically impacts revenues and

                                                                                                            24
International Federation of Film Distributors' Associations (FIAD)

   investments in both physical and online distribution, as well as investment in content creation. Unlike
   some perspectives, intellectual property rights are by no means a barrier to access content. In fact,
   they are the solution by creating viable business models for creators and those who invest in the
   creation of content.
   Indeed, to demonstrate this point, in contemporary times there is a wide availability of legal services
   online and new services are constantly being developed in the audiovisual, music and publishing
   sectors. For example, the Council of Europe’s Audiovisual Observatory has revealed in a market
   survey that over 700 legitimate on-demand audiovisual services were available in 2009 and also over
   250 legal music services available in Europe. Nevertheless, even in countries with the highest number
   of legal online services, high levels of digital piracy continue to cannibalise legal offerings and thwart
   the development of a legitimate online marketplace for creative works. This clearly shows that, even
   if additional legal offers should continue to be encouraged, the problem of online piracy needs to be
   tackled in itself.
   To create a genuine Single Market in Europe, restrictions on freedom of movement and anti-
   competitive practices must be eliminated or reduced as much as possible, while creating an
   environment favourable to innovation and investment. In this context, the protection of intellectual
   property is an essential element for the success of the Single Market. In our growing knowledge-
   based economies, the protection of intellectual property is important not only for promoting
   innovation and creativity, but also for developing employment and improving competitiveness.


   76.     In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
   involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
   payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
   infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
   the cooperation of intermediaries?
   FIAD feels that while the current legal framework is largely effective in protecting copyright, there
   are certain areas where measures could be taken to improve certain aspects, particularly relating to
   the involvement of intermediaries. The role of ‘intermediaries’ is crucial in preventative measures
   against IPR infringement. Although the current Enforcement Directive does put tools in place to
   address IPR infringement, these measures do not achieve the desired results because they fail to
   properly address the crucial role intermediaries play in copyright infringements. Internet
   ‘intermediaries’ are in essence ‘the gatekeepers’ of the Internet and are indispensable to the goal of
   preventing IPR infringement. That is why the role these intermediaries play (and can play) in curbing
   digital piracy needs to be reviewed. It is our conviction that an effective and comprehensive solution
   to curb piracy can only be obtained through their co-operation. So-called ‘intermediaries,’ whose
   services are used in infringing activities, both directly and indirectly, bear responsibility and have the
   obligation to prevent such infringements.
   We feel that on the whole, Article 8(3) of the Copyright Directive is one effective tool in achieving
   cooperation from intermediaries against copyright infringement, but feel that in certain ways it is
   lacking. This is in particular due to the crucial issue that some Member States still have not
   implemented this provision and the corresponding provisions in the Enforcement Directive in a
   correct manner. As a result, some Member States’ legislative frameworks still require the finding of
   some form of liability on the part of the intermediary, such as in Germany and Sweden. The lack of
   implementation of Article 8(3) means that some national courts still hold that injunctions against
   intermediaries can only be granted if the intermediary can be imputed with liability. Of course,
   injunctions under Article 8(3) are granted on the basis that the intermediary is “best placed” (ref.
   Recital 59 of the Copyright Directive) to bring the infringement to an end, and this has been
   confirmed in the recent CJEU case law. However, national courts in Member States that lack



                                                                                                          25
International Federation of Film Distributors' Associations (FIAD)
www.fiad.eu
   implementation of Article 8(3) do not follow this precedent. We therefore call for the correct
   implementation of Article 8(3) by all Member States to foster cooperation by intermediaries.
   A second point is that right holders’ cooperation with Internet stakeholders in the fight against online
   infringements is also often frustrated by the fact that Internet intermediaries generally do not record
   client data or they record inaccurate client data. Internet intermediaries such as domain name
   providers, hosting providers, payment providers, and online ad-brokers should be subject to “know
   your customer” obligations (see Article 5 of the Enforcement Directive) and the money laundering
   Directives. In particular, right holders should have the legal means to identify and locate commercial
   scale infringers. The CJEU has confirmed in L’Oreal v. eBay that infringers operating in the course of
   trade must be identifiable (see paragraph 142 in L’Oreal v. eBay). The existing EU “know your
   customer” (KYC) legislation (see 3rd Money Laundering Directive) applies to banks, lawyers, real
   estate agents, and casinos; we suggest that it should also be made applicable to Internet
   intermediaries. Anonymous businesses prevent the legal system from working in a fair and balanced
   manner.
   Furthermore, mere notice and takedown procedures are insufficient to address infringements that
   are taking place on a massive scale; much greater clarity is needed in this area. We believe it is
   reasonable and appropriate to expect such ‘intermediaries,’ as lawful businesses, to aid in the
   prevention of abuse of their services for illegal purposes. As pointed out in the previous consultation,
   there are many steps they can take that have been proven to be effective without being unduly
   burdensome. Furthermore, we would also recommend adapting the Directive in a way that
   recognises the role that ‘intermediaries’ play and the responsibility they bear. Their responsibility
   should also be clear in relation to the liability exemption put in place by the E-commerce Directive.
   The term ‘intermediary’ is highly ambiguous and in practice often misleading. That is why the
   definition of an ‘intermediary,’ which is eligible for a liability exemption, requires clarity in order to
   distinguish them from irresponsible actors. It would be preferable if the Directive describes the types
   of activities that will disqualify this service from being able to invoke one of the liability exemptions
   under the E-Commerce Directive. This will prevent ‘intermediaries’ from taking advantage of the
   broad scope of the current definition.
   In addition, we argue that a service that structurally and systematically facilitates copyright
   infringement whilst generating revenues should not qualify for the liability privileges set forth in
   Articles 12-14 of the E-Commerce Directive. This principle is clear from both decisions by the Court of
   Justice of the European Union and the majority of national case law. However, certain decisions at
   national level have addressed this matter incorrectly. It would be helpful to clarify that such sites are
   not only subject to injunction orders requiring them to filter out infringing content, but that they may
   also be subject to criminal and/or civil liability.
   We wish to draw the Commission’s attention to a number of issues arising in connection with
   attempts to obtain injunctive relief against intermediaries. In several Member States, these attempts
   are severely undermined by the failure to implement the specific provisions of the Copyright and the
   Enforcement Directives. In certain cases, Member States have turned to general civil law rules.
   However, conflicting rules often create problems for the courts where an intermediary under civil
   law is not necessarily liable for the underlying infringements.


   77.    Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
   achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
   protection of private life and protection of personal data?
   NO
   The current situation in the EU is manifested in recent decisions made by the CJEU (Promusicae,
   L'Oreal v. eBay and Sabam v. Netlog) that have clarified that national courts shall apply the


                                                                                                          26

   proportionality test in adjudicating on matters involving a balancing of right to having one’s copyright
   protected and other rights such as protection of personal data. These decisions have emphasised the
   need to weigh all fundamental rights before coming to a fair and balanced decision. In doing so, the
   courts shall take into account the rights and interests of the parties and stakeholders concerned.
   Nevertheless, despite this situation we feel that there are certain issues in the current civil
   enforcement framework that need further refinement. The right to property is a fundamental right
   as much as the right to the protection of personal data, but there is a need for equal treatment and
   correct balancing of the different rights. It is clear that data protection rights cannot mean tolerance
   for illegal activities by actors who purposely hide behind this right, disqualifying in this way the right
   to property.
   Often the only tool available for rights holders to attempt to take action against infringers in these
   cases is the right of information, provided by Article 8(1) of the Enforcement Directive.
   Unfortunately, we see that in practice the right to obtain information about infringers has been put
   into question in some countries due to the unclear relationship between data protection rules and
   enforcement rules at EU level. In general, it seems that Article 8(1) is implemented differently across
   Member States, and in some cases is deprived of any effect. A number of Member States and/or
   national courts interpret data protection rules as preventing the acquisition of data that would be
   helpful in identifying online infringers. In such cases, this reduces the number of remedies right
   holders have to enforce their rights at national level. With regards to the first paragraph of this
   answer, which concerns the power of national courts use of the proportionality test, it is clear that
   there is the potential for great differences in approach across Europe and a deficiency in legal
   certainty for rights holders. In some Member States, the relationship between the right of
   information and data protection and data retention rules is unclear; in other Member States, data
   protection rules prevent disclosure. This is why it would be desirable to clarify the interaction
   between data protection rules and the implementation of the Enforcement Directive, making sure
   that data protection does not prejudice the possibility for right holders to protect their rights.
   However, while protecting copyright in support of creative industries should be a priority fulfilled
   through a more efficient civil enforcement system in the EU, it is just one component of the solution
   to address widespread infringement. We believe that a comprehensive approach that maintains
   proper protection of property rights, access to justice, freedom of expression and data protection is
   possible.




          VI. A single EU Copyright Title

   78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
   of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
   EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
   NO
   The question of the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title is one that needs more robust
   definition than that provided in this consultation.
   Were the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title to be done alongside national titles, FIAD
   would have particular concerns with the potential for such a situation actually adding a further layer
   of complexity to the copyright system in the EU. FIAD feels that such unnecessary complexity is best
   avoided.

   Were the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title to be created in replacement of each of the
   national copyright titles of the Member States, then this is something that would take decades to
   achieve. In addition, simply replacing current national systems with a European Copyright Title would
   appear premature and too complex, given the strength of national preoccupations expressed at the
   adoption of the EU Copyright Directive. Any initiative would require very careful and in-depth impact
   assessment in order to comprehensively assess the potential impact and asserted improvement of
   the current situation.


   79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
   current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
   term project?

   Title is one that needs more robust definition than that provided in this consultation.

   situation.
   Furthermore, we feel that it is not clear that the Lisbon Treaty confers specific competency to the EU
   in regards to copyright and whether Article 118 of the Lisbon Treaty can be extended to include
   “copyright.” From our understanding, this provision was in fact meant to address issues related to
   “industrial property rights.” Indeed, according the UK House of Lords, “the new Article 118 of the
   TFEU is a restatement of existing powers. Although the Treaty of Lisbon would not confer additional
   IP powers on the EU, it marks a statement of political intent and a commitment to achieving the
   Community patent.”14 To this date, the EU has adopted legislation in the field of intellectual property
   with the legal basis in the general internal market provisions, which remains the appropriate legal
   basis for intellectual property legislation today.
