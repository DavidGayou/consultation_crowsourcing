President of the Association of Television Programming Distributors Signal



      The non-profit Association of Television Programming Distributors
Sygnal was established in January 2002 with its mission to prevent from
television piracy.
      At present the Association consists of many members like  for  example
representatives of Cyfrowy Polsat, HBO Polska,  INEA,  VIMN  Polska,  Orange
Polska, Digital Platform nc+, Walt Disney Polska Fox International  Channels
Polska, Sony Pictures Television and BBC Worldwide Channels.  During  recent
General Assembly Meeting of the Members of Sygnal Association  in  May  2013
there were admitted successive  supporting  members:  Telewizja  Polsat  SA,
Irdeto, Nagravision and Redefine.
      Main goal of Sygnal is prevention from  thieve  of  television  signal
from CAT TV systems and DTH platforms, bequilement and forgery  of  original
equipment as well as admitting to trade counterfeit key words  and  set-top-
boxes. In order to execute this task,  every  year,  in  different  part  of
Poland, Sygnal organizes many seminars and training  courses  dedicated  for
specific  groups  from  police  officers  of  economic   crime   departments
at constabulary to  economic  crime  departments  of  municipal  and  county
police headquarters. Besides, in order  to  increase  the  effectiveness  of
Polish judiciary concerning TV piracy the Association  offers  and  conducts
conferences for both districts and provincials’ prosecutor’s offices.  Apart
from  the  above  mentioned  activities,  appointed  representatives  of our
Members together with the police, make findings,  carry  out  investigations
and take actions against television piracy mainly  by  monitoring  Internet,
but also visiting software fairs and warehouses of distributors of  set-top-
boxes. Such an activity reduces illegal production and manufacture  of  chip
cards and decoders/set-top-boxes as well as the amount of  illegal  software
available for downloading through different web pages.  Hence, daily  active
collaboration of our members with the police across Poland, only  last  year
contributed  to bringing  over  180  lawsuits  against   perpetrators   that
circumvented the conditional system access of DTH  TV  in  Poland.  In  some
cases of so called “sharing” there were over 100 criminals involved  in  one
lawsuit.
      Taking  into  consideration  all  the  above,  the  members   of   the
Association not only inform and bring the social  awareness  to  the  public
about the damages produced by so called piracy,  but  also  about  punishing
acts of legal regulations that come after.
Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules.

   1. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?



      One of the most important challenges both for the European  Union  and
the  European  countries  are  protection  of  local   companies,   domestic
economies and consumers associated  with  equal  opportunities  as  well  as
harmonized   conditions   to   run   businesses   in   the   EU    territory
by entrepreneurs having their  registered  seats  in  different  continents.
Course of action connected with introduction  of  the  Single  EU  copyright
title applicable in the entire EU territory  which  would  replace  existing
national copyright systems is  desirable  and  justified  as  long  as  this
solution applies not only to European registered business  entities  but  to
all entrepreneurs which  run  their  businesses  connected  with  the  works
exploitation in the EU territory. In case of  e-commerce  services  we  talk
about services directed to individuals within EU  territory  and  commercial
activity  connected  with  the  EU  market  (collection  fees  directly   or
indirectly from users, dissemination  of  advertisements  addressed  to  the
citizens of the EU). The Internet allows users to offer  its  services  from
any place in the world irrespectively of  the  server  location,  registered
seat of the subject (e.g. operator) who provides  above  mentioned  services
or the domain register location and its  technical  support.  A  significant
proportion of entrepreneurs are trying to avoid the legal liability  provide
its services to inhabitants of  other  countries  in  which  providing  such
services constitutes an infringement  of  applicable  laws  therein.   It is
therefore necessary to take steps to create a uniform  legal  system,  which
will provide a consistent way to protect  consumers  and  the  entrepreneurs
detached from the principle of territoriality.  This  action  is  absolutely
necessary not  only  on  account  of  the  more  effective  legal  copyright
protection, but also on account of the protection of  local  economies.  The
important issue on the market of online content distribution is also a  fact
that over the 50% of income from advertisements which are a main  source  of
financing the Internet’s projects, goes to  "large"  enterprises  registered
in the United States of North America (e.g. in Mountain  View,  that  is  in
one of the principal cities that  make  up  Silicon  Valley)  which  do  not
support the development of the local (European)  entrepreneurships,  and  do
not also provide the appropriate protection both for European consumers  and
entrepreneurs as well as for authors and other right holders.. The scale  of
this phenomenon is growing from year to year, and already at this  point  is
significant for the European economy.  According  to  the  IAB  Europe  data
concerning 26 countries, the value of  the  online  advertisements  in  2012
amounted to 24.3  billion  Euro.  Further  consent  for  entrepreneurs  from
outside the European Union to reap profits from provided  by  them  services
on the EU market without imposing on them the same responsibilities  as  the
ones that lies with European entrepreneurs would lead for further  weakening
of the European (including the Polish one) innovation and  economic  growth.
What is more, it would be  a  clear  signal  of  priority  attitude  towards
enterprises with global reach in relation to local entrepreneurs.
Key  issue  at  pursuit  of  the  civil  damages  actions  in  relation   to
infringement of the intellectual property rights in the digital  environment
is an international factor (e.g. in case when service provider’s  registered
seat is in one country, and  dissemination  (infringement)  takes  place  in
other country) and consequently the process of establishing appropriate  law
is being translated into real opportunity  to  pursuit  claims  by  entitled
right holder. As an example it is worth to note that the Article  3  of  the
Directive on electronic commerce provides that the applicable law in the  EU
Members State should be determined in conformity with  the  registered  seat
of the service provider.
The above mentioned rule, i.e. the principle of country of origin,  is  also
reflected in Article 3a of the  Act  on  Providing  Services  by  Electronic
Means which implements this Directive into the Polish  law  order.  However,
the principle  of  country  of  origin  does  not  apply  to  protection  of
copyright and related rights, databases and an industrial property  (Article
3a (2) (1) of the Act on  Providing  Services  by  Electronic  Means).  This
exclusion results from  the  principle  of  territoriality  in  intellectual
property law (lex loci protectionis principle).
Eventually the principle of the country of origin has been rejected for  two
reasons. Firstly, some  problems  appeared  in  determining  the  source  of
transmission due to the technical complexity of activity undertaken  in  the
digital environment. Secondly, adoption as relevant the law of  the  country
from which territory  specific  transmission  was  introduced  into  digital
environment, could result in the low level  of  protection  of  intellectual
property  what  could   be   regarded   as   favoring   infringements.   So,
consistently, pursuant to Article 33 of the Private  International  Law  Act
the law applicable to the obligation arising from the  occurrence  which  is
not a juridical act  shall  be  regulated  by  Rome  II  -  Regulation  (EC)
Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 of the  European  Parliament  and of the Council
of 11 July 2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual  obligations  (Rome
II) (OJ L 199/40, 31/07/2007, p. 40). Whereas pursuant to Article 8  (1)  of
this regulation the law applicable to a non-contractual  obligation  arising
from an infringement of an intellectual property right shall be the  law  of
the country for which protection is claimed.
Unfortunately it is not clear how to understand the extract "the law of  the
country  for  which  protection  is  claimed".  There   are   two   possible
interpretations that arise. According to the first one,  it depends  on  the
entitled which  law  shall  be  applicable,  because  the  entitled  finally
decides whether to seek the protection in general.  As  a  consequence,  the
person sustaining damage could also decide to seek the protection in law  of
a  country  of   its   registered   seat.   However,   this   interpretation
is unacceptable. Article 8(3) of the regulation forbids  concluding  freedom
of choice contracts in similar cases therefore an assumption  that  such  an
act could come into force  by  unilateral  operation  of  entitled  party  a
maiori ad minus cannot be accepted. And so the law of the country, based  on
which one  may  seek  the  protection,  should  be  indicated  according  to
objective criteria. Moreover, undoubtedly it should be the  country  somehow
related to the event being a subject of evaluation. Therefore it seems  that
the only option which remains is to  address  the  issue  to the country  in
which granting protection in a  particular  case  is  justified  (necessary)
that  is in consequence  the  country  which  legislation   was   infringed.
Consequently, the extract "the law of the country for  which  protection  is
claimed" should be understand as the law of the country  where  a breach  of
intellectual property rights took place.  Therefore,  as  the  domestic  law
protects the copyright only within the limits of  its  territorial  validity
an occurrence of this type of illegal  activity  on  the  territory  of  one
country (Poland) cannot be treated as  an  infringement  that  breaches  the
domestic law of the other country. This way the adoption as appropriate  law
of the country in which there had been no violation of law,  could  lead  to
refusal of protection (dismissal of action) on the basis  of  the  argument,
according to which that law was not infringed (and therefore  action  is not
from this point of view illegal).
It must be concluded therefore that  the  lex  loci  protectionis  principle
(Article 8  (1)  of  the  regulation),  which  should  cover  all  cases  of
infringement of intellectual property, is the rule clear  enough  only  when
the given right is protected exclusively in one country. Otherwise, that  is
in a situation  where  entity  who  infringe  the  owner’s  rights  has  its
registered seat in other country than the country in which  the  service  is
provided to by  the  entity,  the  applicable  law  for  the  protection  of
intellectual property rights will be domestic law according to the  location
where the infringement has taken place, because only on the  basis  of  this
law, seeking the protection would be possible.
Currently the companies that operate video industry most often have to  face
the second scenario. That is because, in case of rendering illegal  services
in language of users of the country to  which  such  service  (e.g.  running
website or distribution of audiovisual works)  in  fact  is  being  provided
(addressed) and other than the country in which the entity who infringe  the
owner’s right has its registered seat, it should be obvious that the  entity
who infringe the owner’s right is operating in reality in  the  country,  to
which  this  service   was   directly   provided.   However,   the   problem
is in the fact that the place of infringement is  established  according  to
the location of servers or the registered seat of the entity  who  infringes
the  owner’s  right.  In  such  case  the  local  substantive  law  is  also
applicable, and the possibility of  taking  legal  action  is  usually  also
possible only in this country, and not  e.g.  in  Poland.  It  is  therefore
necessary to  postulate  that  the  infringement  shall  not  be  identified
according to the place where entity who  infringe  the  owner’s  right  real
acted.  As the place of infringement should be treated also the place  where
some effects of the action occurred.
The basis  for  establishing  relevant  jurisdiction  for  infringement  the
rights should be the country in which  the  service  is  being  provided  or
reaches its “target”  and  not  the  country  of  domain  registration,  the
registered seat of the  entity  who  infringes  the  owner’s  right  or  the
country where the source of “transmission” is located.  The  European  Union
should aim for organization of the rules of cooperation between  Europe  and
the United States in scope of providing  Internet  services.  Lack of action
of local  European  governments,  as  well  as  the  entire  European  Union
resulted in the fact that half of the budgets  allocated  for  the  Internet
industry financed in the website advertising model are being derived  across
the ocean. As a result there is a lack of support for local markets  through
submission to the tax system, the  local  labor  market  is  not  developing
and customers  are  not  being  protected  in  accordance  with   principles
consistent  with  locally  applicable  laws.  In  the  situation  of  silent
agreement of local governments, preferential conditions for conducting   for
entrepreneurs   with   the   international   scope   of   operations   while
the competitiveness of local companies is getting smaller
It is a common practice that servers/domains of websites which are using  to
infringe  of  intellectual  property  rights  are  registered  in  different
country than the  country  in  which  the  owner  has  its registered  seat.
Besides, also the Internet itself is being  used  to  infringe  the  rights,
because of its strictly cross-border nature. Moreover,  the  profits  gained
from activity based on  infringements  of  the  law  are  being  transferred
through agents in different countries to  conceal  their  source  of origin.
Such as situation demands for cooperation between authorities  of  different
countries. Therefore,  it  is  increasingly  postulated  to  grant  to  “the
cyberspace" the status of different location (other reality) than  the  real
world and to create a separate, appropriate to  its  characteristics  system
of law. Such a system of law would regulate any legal  situations  that  may
be encountered on the Internet by its  users.  The  law  of  the  cyberspace
would include the following fields  of  the  law:  the  copyright  law,  the
industrial property law, the protection  of  personal  rights,  as  well  as
elements of the press law and the civil law. The aim of such a system  would
be to make liable all users of the Internet global network  so  that  nobody
could ignore regulations due to lack of knowledge on the foreign law.
In principle, the harmonization of copyright law in  the  EU  is  the  right
direction of action. The main advantage of such a regulation  would  be  the
exclusion of conflicts of various legal systems, elimination of the  problem
of choice of the legal framework applicable to the given facts, and  what is
the most important such a regulation  would  allow  to  develop   new  legal
structures  specific  only  for  international  computer  networks.   As   a
consequence, the number of infringements on the Internet  would  be  reduced
to a considerable degree. However, it would be necessary  for  this  purpose
to implement  mechanisms  facilitating  identification   of   entities   who
infringe the owner’s right, taken into account the fact that the  cyberspace
is devoid  of  any  physical  attributes  of  someone’s  presence,  such  as
fingerprints, voice or image.

11. Should the provision of hyperlink leading to a  work  or  other  subject
matter protected under  copyright,  either  in  general  or  under  specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

      Yes, all models of  distribution  or  content  cataloguing  (including
hyperlinks and cataloguing services of the content published by  the  users)
should be the subject to the same copyright regulations. Any exemption  from
these regulations for entities which offer access to content  based  on  the
specific business model (e.g. links’ catalogue)  leads  to  the  competitive
inequality as well as constitutes incentive  for  creation  of  non-licensed
systems of content distribution outside the law.
There should be two conditions, which should be met  simultaneously  to  use
the work of the rightholder. The first condition is  the  commercial  nature
of the activity while the second one is connected with  addressing  services
to citizens of the EU, irrespectively of either  the  country  of registered
seat of the  entity  that  offer  the  access  to  content  nor  the  server
location.  Providing or facilitating  the  access  to   content   (e.g.   by
cataloguing links or content published by users) for citizens of the  EU  in
order  to  gain  financial  benefits  (by  collecting  fees  from  users  or
presenting commercials) should constitute activity regulated both under  the
copyright law and the media law as well as  the  other  relevant  provisions
regulating services provided by electronic means.

15. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


      Provisions of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary  and
Artistic Works that  introduce  a general  rule  that  works  are  protected
regardless of the fulfillment of any formal requirements are an obstacle  to
enforce such type of regulation. Introduction of a  system  of  registration
of works would cause problems with  their  licensing  Main  disadvantage  of
such solution would  be  the  transfer  of  authority  on  making  decisions
whether the given piece of work meets the condition to  be  a  work  in  the
meaning of copyrights law to the body responsible for registration  (instead
of the court during court proceeding).Such approach may result in  the  fact
that many pieces of art  would  not be considered  works  (under  copyrights
law) or on the contrary too  many  of  them  would  be recognized  as  such.
Besides, as the works’ registration would  probably  require  relevant  fees
also the cost of license would have been  increased  accordingly.  Moreover,
currently a work is under the copyright protection since  its  creation,  so
the question should be raised whether in case of introduction  of  the  work
registration system, such a protection would not have been dependent on  its
registration and since when then it would have been valid. This in  turn  is
significant taking into account perspective of the  length  of  registration
of trademarks in the Polish Patent Office.

20.  Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in  the
digital environment?

      Proprietary copyrights by their nature  are  subject  to  a  temporary
protection.  Duration  of  such  protection  is  very  long.  It  should  be
emphasized that the majority of the  20th  century  artistic  work  is still
under the copyrights’ protection. Such a long  time  of  protection  is  not
adequate to the current reality. Assuming  that  an  author  dies  30  years
after creating a work (which is nothing exceptional), the  work  is  subject
to a hundred years' protection. However currently,  a  cycle  of  commercial
"living" of works is in majority being counted in years,  and  even  months.
Such a situation causes numerous practical problems - among  others  problem
of orphan works. Protection period that lasts 70 year since the death of  an
author usually embraces two generations,  and  reaching  rightholders  after
a dozen or so years is  practically  impossible.  For  the  above  mentioned
reason many former works are not being exploited (e.g. by hotheads or  those
ones who would like to “refresh" them).
The number of scientific researches confirms that the optimal period of  the
copyright  protection  should  last  between  15  and  38  years   that   is
significantly shorter than the currently valid  one  which  lasts  70  years
after death of  an  author.  It  is  worthwhile  to  stress  that  too  long
protection is not good for the authors  too  (see  the  Declaration  of  the
European    Academics     of     2009     –     available     at     website
http://www.cippm.org.uk/downloads/Press%20Release%20Copyright%20Extension.pd
f (2009).
Besides, the fact that the costs of too long period of  protection  have  to
bear recipients of works (consumers, users)  is  a  disadvantage.  Professor
Paul Heald demonstrated that in  case  of  the  majority  of  publishers  an
average price of copyrighted book was USD 8.90 while in case of  books  that
were not copyright protected - only 6.30 USD (see  Heald  Paul,  ‘  Property
Rights and the Efficient Exploitation of  Copyrighted  Works:  An  Empirical
Analysis  of  Public  Domain   and   Copyrighted   Fiction   Best   Sellers’
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=955954 available  on  the
website). Moreover, in the age  of  technologies  like  ebooks  and  ebooks’
readers, a lot of unprotected publications are available for free.
The long overdue copyright protection  holds  down/limits   availability  of
very works (see e.g. New York the Times 11th  December 2013 – European  Laws
Lead Copyright is Rare Music Releases  and Heald  ‘  How  Paul  Makes  Books
Copyright and Music Disappear '(2013)). Out of 10.027 of books published  in
1930, in year 2001 only 174 were  still  being  printed.  (yes:  Landes  and
Posner, The Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law, 2003, p.  212).
Besides, in regards to orphan works the long  overdue  copyright  protection
also leads to the escalation of these issues.

21. Are there problems arising from  the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
   exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for  the
   Member States?


      No, the EU copyright directives should not  oblige  Member  States  to
adopt all exceptions in the domestic law. This process should  be  regulated
in the  form  of  letting  the  possibility  of  putting  into  force  those
exceptions into the legal system of an individual Member State, but  in  the
form of a closed catalogue of strictly defined acceptable exceptions.

23. Should some/all of the exceptions be  made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

      The current scope of fair use seems to be correct. However,  the  term
“social relationship” should be clarified. Discussions like  whether  e.gthe
friend  from  the  social  networking  website  really   stays   in such   a
relationship has already appeared. Due  to  the  rapid  growth  of  Internet
activities the issue that refers to the interpretation fair use of  will  be
emerging much more often.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to  provide  for
a  greater  degree  of flexibility  in  the  EU  regulatory  framework   for
limitations and exceptions?

      Regulations of fair use should be possibly precise  and  universal  so
that they  would  not  become  outdated  in  environment  of  the  incessant
development of new technologies (including the Internet).
In a frame of fair use in the area of  digital  distribution  and  with  the
pressure on the Internet, the terms  and  conditions  of  use  of  the  work
require clarification. Firstly, the term “a copy” should  be clarified  with
reference to works in digital form -. The term “social relationship”  should
also be clarified in respect of the Internet relationship.
There is kind of uncertainty concerning the scope of fair  use  that  exists
in  the  valid  law  order.  Consequently,   above   mentioned   uncertainty
translates into substantial doubts concerning the scope and  level  of  fees
for devices and data storage media (technical measures), which  in  case  of
adoption the exception to the reproduction right by  a  given  Member  State
should constitute fair amounts of compensation for right holders.

Ad. 21 Independently from the questions above, is there a  need  to  provide
for a greater degree of flexibility  in  the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
limitations and exceptions?

Firstly, we should focus on  the  problem  of  terminology  applied  in  the
legislation  which  is  coming  from  notions  developed  in   times,   when
duplication occurred only in the analogue form.  Provisions  of  the  Polish
Act on the copyright and  related  rights  -  use  in  the  way  not  always
consistent notions  of:  "dissemination",  "reproduction"  and  "copy".  For
example Article (20) (1)  (2) of Act on the  copyright  and  related  rights
has introduced a fee from "(…) reprographic  devices  which  allow  to  make
copies of all or  a  part  of  a  published  work  ."  On  the  other  hand,
Subparagraph 3 of  the  Article  adopts  fee  obligation  on  “   (…)  blank
carriers used for fixing, within the scope of fair use, works or objects  of
related rights,”.  These concepts  are  starting  point  in  specifying  the
scope of the fair use.  There are some other doubts that arise in  reference
to the scope of  identification  of  the  notions  i.e.  fair  use  (broader
meaning) and one’s own fair use (notion being included  in  the  scope  fair
use).
Apart from changing terminology resulting  from  technological  development,
the  modification  of  means  of  distribution   and   content   consumption
(including  works)  should  be  also  indicated.  We  are  also   witnessing
progressive divergence from the model based on copy of the work towards  the
model resting on access (e.g. to cloud computing services)  what  ultimately
should reduce universality of  creating  (downloading)  traditional  private
copies. Therefore, there  is  a  requirement  for  diversification  of  work
reproduction cases and the distinct  decision  whether  in  particular  case
reproduction occurs as part of a fair use  as  well  as  whether  it  causes
damages on the part of a right holder.
The current lack of  the  harmonization  causes  the  legal  insecurity  and
substantial impediments for content providers and operators on  the  uniform
(unified) European market. However, adoption of new business models  to  all
Member States withholds this process too much. Moreover the current  absence
of the harmonization also strikes consumers as they are  being  deprived  of
clear and cohesive criteria  which  would  enable  them  to  exercise  their
entitlements of a fair use for example.
As an  example  we  could  cite  here  Report  of  A.  Vittorino  containing
recommendations concerning the fees for private copying of  reprography,  in
which the significance of licensing of digital services was emphasized.  The
process of  carrying  private  copy  out  based  on  provisions  of  licence
agreements should not – according to  the  opinion  of  the  author  of  the
report - result in calculating fees, because acting so does  not  cause  any
damages  for  right  holders.  On  the  other  hand  end  users  should  not
repeatedly pays for the same  activity/authorization  e.g.  in  the  licence
agreement and then in  the  price  of  every  device  which  meets  criteria
established by the law of a Member State.
In the analysed scope, pursuant to applicable regulations work  reproduction
may occur :
1. with copyright holder consent (principle) or
2. one of the following exemptions:
a. reproductions on paper or any similar carrier – Article 5 (2)  (a)  of  a
Directive 2001/29/EC (reprography)
b. reproductions  by a natural person for fair use - Article of 5(2) (b)  of
a Directive 2001/29/EC (fair use).
One should note  differences between above mentioned cases and at  the  same
time emphasize that the basic  form  of  a  remuneration  artistic  creators
should  result  from  the  licence  agreement  (based  on   the   right   of
reproduction exclusivity), rather than fair compensation resulting from  the
adoption one of exemptions provisioned by a  Directive  2001/29/EC.  In  our
opinion, in case when the issue of reproduction is regulated in the  licence
agreement there is no justification for mediums’ and  devices’  fees.  Thus,
due to lack of the damages on  copyright  holder’s  side  requiring  a  fair
compensation cannot be applied. Therefore, it is crucial to create  distinct
definition of the cases when reproduction occurs within the fair use.
Apart from the above remarks,  it  should  be  indicated  that  the  present
definition  of  fair   use   in   the   Polish   legislation   causes   many
interpretational problems. Above all, a character of the original work  used
for reproduction as part of own fair use still remains unsolved.  The  above
matter is also decisive for determining character of mediums’  and  devices’
fees. Depending on interpretation these charges can  assume  the  form  "fee
from piracy" - e.g. when the person as part of one’s own fair  use  performs
reproduction of work obtained  illegally  or  fee  from  work  obtained  and
reproduced in legal way. Companies associated  in  the  Polish  Chamber  are
explicitly in favor of the latter interpretation.

26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in   your
experience, constitute a problem?

This is the issue that could be solved (addressed) through  the  unification
of exceptions  on  the  level  of  the  EU  in  the  catalogue  of  optional
solutions. This solution  should  marginalize  the  problem  of  application
territorial exceptions and limitations.

30. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
   its main elements? Which  activities  of  the  beneficiary  institutions
   should be covered and under which conditions?

The exploitation of  works  and  related  rights  should  be  based  on  the
institution of fair use. The statutory licence  should  allow  research  and
educational institutions to  use  disseminated  works  in  original  and  in
translation and to make copies of fragments of the  disseminated  work  free
of charge. Obviously  such  regulation  should  be  applied  exclusively  on
condition that exploitation of works is permitted for teaching  purposes  or
in order to conduct their own research. This regulation should not be  based
on meeting requirements of not obtaining material benefits.
Disabilities
 (b) [In particular if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?
(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?
Article 5 (3) (b) of Directive 2001/29/EC  allows  non-commercial  using  of
protected works by people with a disability. However,  such  usage  must  be
related to the specific disability.
It is worth to mention that on 28th June 2013, in Marrakech  WIPO  organized
the Diplomatic Conference, which was concluded  with  the  adoption  of  the
Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published  Works  for  Persons  Who
Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled. This Treaty  will
enable distribution and public access to copies of works adjusted for  blind
or visually impaired persons both in the country and abroad. In near  future
this Treaty will be signed by the EU and its  Member  States  and  ratified.
Implementation of this Treaty may require an amendment  of  the  EU  law  in
particular with the aspect of cross-border use  of  works  of  the  recalled
exception.

50. What mechanisms exist in the market place  to  facilitate  accessibility
   to content? How successful are they?

It is noteworthy that Article  331  of  the  Polish  Copyright  and  Related
Rights Act  (as  a  part  of  fair  use)  allows  in  institutionalised  way
adjusting works to fulfill  accessibility need of  disabled  persons.   This
regulation enables largernumber of people  to  participate  in  the  current
information society. Consequently they can improve their qualification.

55.  Are  there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
   barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

We should promote the effective use of texts and data for  the  purposes  of
researches. Currently, usage  of  texts  and  data  requires  conclusion  of
agreements between users (usually research centers) and rightholders.  (e.g.
publishers of scientific journals) to establish  technical  aspects  of  the
terms of access to relevant database.
It is necessary to determine on the EU level the scale of demand for  access
to texts and data usage in relation to academic publications. There is  also
a need to asses adequate means that could meet this  demand.  Moreover  it's
necessary to examine possible limitations of the standard drafts of  licence
agreement  and  to  evaluate  the  ability  of  technological  platforms  to
facilitate the access to texts and data exploration.

60. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
   its main elements? Which activities should be  covered  and  under  what
   conditions?

The publication of content  by  its  owners  (e.g.  blogs,  podcasts,  video
streaming, photographs/pictures) in online network like Facebook,  Instagram
or Wordpress is  currently  very  popular.  Therefore,  the  European  Union
should commence and to regulate  these issues. It should be noted  that  the
owners of online services based on  creative  activity  of  its  users  gain
significant profits from such activity. That's whythe EU should  concentrate
on two crucial aspects of this phenomenon.
The first one refers to an infringement of the intellectual property  by  an
unauthorized usage of works. Illegitimated users in such cases refer to  the
freedom of speech. Due to the fact that the owners of online  services  base
their business model on the activity of users such explanation is  for  them
convenient, because they gain high profits.  Currently,  such  owners  avoid
liability despite receiving infringement notice, in accordance with  Article
14 Directive 2000/31/EC, arguing that they are  not  responsible  for  their
users’ actions. However, such owners should  participate  in  protection  of
copyrights.
The second one concerns providing adequate protection for users
disseminating their works in online services. Currently, the majority of
online services put in their terms and conditions the provision to assume
all rights to the content published in their services including its
commercial usage at a later date. The EU should notice such issue, because
it is connected with depriving authors of works of future profits from its
usage.

63. Should digital copies made by end users  for  private  purposes  in  the
context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and  where  the
harm  to  the  rightholder  is  minimal,  be  subject  to  private   copying
levies?[1]

Yes, the system of payments for of the private digital copying  should  take
into account situations in which reproduction of a  legally  purchased  copy
of work is made in accordance with rightholders  authorization.  This  is  a
typical situation  e.g.  in  case  of  the  Ultraviolet  or   multi-platform
content distribution business models.   Due  to  the  fact  that  legitimate
distribution of works  already  involves  relevant  fees  there  damage  for
rightholders in such models.
Failure to obey the above mentioned model despite  of  rightholders  consent
could  lead  to  duplication  of  obligatory  fee  received   by   competent
collective management  organization,  and  as  a  consequence  would  hamper
development of innovative business models.
Payments for carriers and devices should  be  applied  exclusively  in  case
where harm to the rightholders is possible to prove. The system of  payments
should also take  into  account  the  situation  when  reproduction  of  the
legitimate copy is  made  with  the  consent  of  a  rightholder  e.g.  when
obtaining access to works via streaming or cloud – since in this case it  is
difficult to find any damages to the rightholders.
In case of works reproduction there  are  several  more  examples  where  no
damages occurs to rightholders. These are as follows:
1. Conversions of contents/works to other format (format shifting)
2. Creating of backup copy
3. Using time-shifting technology in set-top-boxes and TV-sets which do  not
enable to create copies of which has economic value
Above mentioned cases should be included in regulations as  exceptions  from
the system of payment.

64. How would changes in levies with respect to the application  to   online
services (e.g. services based on cloud computing   allowing,  for  instance,
users to have copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the  development  and
functioning of new  business  models  on  the  one  hand  and  rightholders’
revenue on the other?

As far as it comes to the new models of distribution, as of the  ones  based
on the cloud technology  there  is  no  reproduction  by  copying  from  one
device/carrier  o  to  the  other..  Additionally,  legal  models  of   work
distribution in the cloud technology are defined  under  licence  agreements
between service providers and rightholders therefore cannot cause  any  harm
(damages) to the latter. Compensation due  to  the  private  copying  should
still refer only to the case when a work is copied from  one  carrier/device
to the other.. Therefore, the system of  compensation  should  unequivocally
exclude cloud-based services from the carriers and devices payment system.
New technologies change ways of distribution  and  consumption  of  content,
including of works. The following characteristic of such services should  be
noted:
1.  Access  of  works  is  based  on   copyrightholders   consent   (licence
agreements)
2. Cloud-based services are  carried  out  in   closed  ecosystems  enabling
precise control over the access to content (e.g. Spotify, iTunes, Ipla)
In  the  offline  (analogue)  environment  the  manner  that  could  provide
remuneration for creator (author) has not existed.  On  the  other  hand  an
online ‘sphere’ allows for very precise copyright protection  of  works,  as
well  as  for   the   convenient   way   of   making   payments   (including
micropayments). Current solutions allow to regulate  all  aspects  of  works
usage within of civil law licence agreement.
When it comes  to  the  above  mentioned  services  there  is  no  classical
reproduction of content. One should remember that compensation  for  authors
may concern exclusively a damage suffered in relation to  the  private  use.
Users activity  that violates applicable regulations e.g. illegal access  of
work to public - stay outside the scope of the system of payments.
We think, that implementing fees for services based on new business  models,
would  lead to increase of prices and decrease  competitiveness  of  service
providers operating in the European Union,  what  in  consequence  may  also
cause problems in combating piracy.

65.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on  the  invoices
for products subject to levies?[2]

Placing information on levies may  contribute  to  increasing  awareness  of
this issue among users and rightholders as well as to  raising  transparency
of the entire model of payments.
Such information would allow end users to efficiently seek the repayment  of
unjustified payments (e.g. in case when devices are not being  used  in  the
framework of exceptions indicated  in  the  provisions  of  Directive  2001/
29/EC), ensuring full conformity with the Padawan vs. SGAE  ruling.  Besides
it would enable to monitor allotting payments at the points of  sale   -  in
accordance with A. Vittorino recommendation.

69. If you have identified specific problems with  the  current  functioning
   of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?

In terms of provisions on works, reproduction Directive 2001/29/EC  contains
general  guidelines,  however  it  takes  into  consideration  technological
diversity associated  with  rights  to  the  access  of  works  (Article  5)
including devices for temporary storage of data (Act of 18th July,  2002  on
Providing Services by Electronic Means defines it as ‘caching’) in order  to
provide basic service or services when the data  storage  is  temporary  and
incidental.
Thus, according to intention of the European Parliament only  devices  which
in their assumption are used for reproduction of  works  are  subject  to  a
regulation and not the  ones  that  possess  such  a  functionality  (of  an
auxiliary/secondary character) or temporarily store the  data  in  order  to
provide basic service. Unfortunately national regulations in Poland seem  to
diverge from the guidelines  of  the  European  Parliament  and  Council  of
Europe and try  to  include  all  devices  which  have  data  carriers  that
hypothetically could serve for reproduction of works although it is not  the
main function of the device. Therefore,  first  things  first  it  would  be
essential to consider guidelines of  Directive  2001/29/EC  in  establishing
domestic (national) regulations.
On the Directive level one should clarify the  crucial  issues,  as  at  the
stage of definition different interpretations are already visible  on  local
markets. Of the  same  importance  are  the  following  questions:   how  to
determine when harm occurs in order to form the  grounds  for  compensation,
how to interpret the storage of data for reproduction with reference to  the
temporary data storage, how do the provisions apply to the  data  processing
in cloud technologies or  to  streaming  services  when  there  is  no  file
transmission/copying between data carriers or devices.
It is necessary to harmonise  Member States provisions on  the  compensation
on account of the private copying. The current legal status is  giving  rise
to doubts on many aspects. Firstly it should be indicated that the scope  of
a private use directly affects the damage suffered by rightholder.  Besides,
the definition of damage is recognized differently by the individual  Member
States. The present system leads to the number of disorders  with  reference
to  the  principles  of  operation  of  the  single  market.  Producers  and
importers of devices are  exposed  to  a  great  risk  associated  with  the
uncertainty as for the law (e.g. in Poland it  concerns  the  issue  of  B2B
exclusion) and dissimilarities between systems of  the  debt  collection  in
the individual Member States. In the  extreme  cases,  situations  described
above   refrain  entrepreneurs  from  selling  some  devices  in  individual
countries.
Another  issue  in  Poland  is  a  problem  of  multiple  value  added   tax
calculation for carriers and devices. In case of calculating  VAT  based  on
the gross sale price of device or carrier,  VAT  is  being  calculated  once
again upon a fee payment for the Collective Management  Organizations.  This
is a paradoxical situation and has no justification.
There are serious doubts  as  to  the  definitional  layer  in  relation  to
subjects  obliged  to  make  payment.   Situation  mentioned  above  can  be
reflected in the decision of the Supreme Court - of Civil  Division  –  case
no: III CZP 61 / 11:
However if one wants  to interpret the Article 20  (1)  (2)  of  the  Polish
Copyright and Related Rights Act bearing in mind all  motives  expressed  in
Directive 2001/29/EC and in the judgment in the  "Padawan"  case,  then  the
wording of this provision should have been different.  Determining   wording
of the provision belongs to the legislator that cannot be  replaced  by  the
court, as fairly stated Appeal Court justifying Its decision.  Regarding  an
Article 20 (1) (2) of the  Polish  Copyright  and  Related  Rights  Act  one
should go beyond the current wording and stipulate the sellers’  obligations
 in the chain of distribution rather than only a manufacturer and  importer,
moreover should  describe buyers that  use  reprographic  devices   for  the
private purposes through indicating their features.
Adequate remarks of  the  defendant  in  this  respect  consist  however  in
postulates de lege ferenda. ,  it  is  necessary  to  interpret  Polish  law
according to the system of provisions of the European  Union,  and   verdict
of the Court of Justice of the European Union,  however,  the  directive  in
the system of the EU law does not have direct effects in  the  legal  system
of a Member State. In addition, the current wordingof  Article  20  (1)  (2)
of the Polish Copyright and Related Rights Act is not in conflict  with  the
provisions of Directive 2001/29/EC, but does not correspond exactly  to  its
all   provisions. The same can be  referred  to  a  comparison  between  the
content and purpose of Article 20  (1)  (2)  of  the  Polish  Copyright  and
Related Rights Act with the EU Court of Justice position  in  the  "Padawan"
case.
Existing copyright system should carry out the purpose of  this  law,  which
is to protect the rights of authors and performers,  The  interpretation  of
the Copyright and Related Rights should follow the above mentioned rule.  By
the   predictions  of  reprographics’  fees  collection  imposed   only   to
manufacturers and importers, as it states de lege lata Article  20  (1)  (2)
in connection with Article 5 of the Polish Copyright and Related Rights  Act
 fulfills  the purpose of the law in this regard."
The Supreme Court has clearly pointed out the lack of coherence between  the
provisions of Directive  2001/29/EC  and  the  Polish  regulations  in  this
respect, and as a result decided to make the teleological interpretation  of
provisions in place for the EU interpretation which takes into  account  the
case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Polish law does not contain the distinct connection between the institution
of own private use and fees from devices and carriers - which raises
essential doubts about the nature of these fees. In particular it is not
clear how the fees from devices and carriers should be established.
Legislator laid down the following criterion: capacity of a device and
carrier to reproduce works, and the designed use thereof for functions
other than reproduction of works.
Therefore  there  is  no  reference  to  criteria  arising  from   Directive
2001/29/EC , and case-law of the Court of Justice of the  European  Union  -
such as the need to ensure fair compensation  for  rightholders  which  have
sustained damages  as a result of applying   the  exception  in  respect  of
reproduction for private use.
In our opinion directions of changes of the  current  model  should  include
the following assumptions:
1. Charges from carriers and devices should apply only in a  situation  when
there  is  possible  to  demonstrate  sustained  damages  on  the  side   of
rightholder,
2. Devices and carriers that were not used in a private  use  (B2B  and  B2A
sales models) should be excluded,
3. Charges from carriers and devices cannot interfere  with  the  principles
of the common market and lead to a situation in which the fee for  the  same
activity/authorisation is paid repeatedly,
4. In case  of  content/works  made  available  with  the  authorization  of
rightholder and within the framework of granted   licence no damages  appear
on the side of the subject of the copyright,
5. The model of payments should guarantee  an  "appropriate  balance"  among
businesses of rightholders and users of the protected objects,
6. Unification of applied wording that influence the scope  of  compensation
for private use is required,
7. Fees shall be charged at the point of sale – because only in this way  it
is possible to specify the target destination of the device or carrier,
8. Model of the fees’  payment   should  result  in  the  smallest  possible
burden for manufacturers and importers,
9. Provisions at the EU level should implement a common pricing  methodology
taking into account purchasing  power  of  consumers  in  the  given  Member
State.
There is no justification or the effective enforcement capacity  to  execute
charges in case of secondary transfer of ownership of carrier or device.

73. Should  the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
   efficient for infringements of copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
   purpose?

There is a need for a strong development of works on implementation  of  the
Pan-European procedures for reporting illegal content on  the  Internet.  We
fully endorse the recommendations presented by the  European  Commission  in
the "Digital Agenda for Europe" especially the implementation  of  "European
emergency  number"  for  notification  of  offensive  or  harmful   Internet
content. In addition around this peculiar alarm procedure we would  like  to
express the opinion that  it  should  also  report  gross  infringements  of
copyrights. Works  on  the  amendment  of  current  provisions  should  also
include facilitating the settlement of disputes in cases on infringement  of
intellectual property rights, for example  by  introduction  of  the  Online
Dispute Resolution (ODR) and,  above  all,  an  effective  system  of  legal
assistance in regards to copyright infringements and combating  pathological
phenomena accompanying them like e.g. money laundering, both on  a  European
and over European scale.
In the aspiration to ensure consumer protection in  frames  of  the  digital
single  market  one  should  take  into  account  also  the   interests   of
intellectual property rights. In accordance with EU Court  of  Justice  case
law (joined cases C-236/08, C-238/08 and C-278/08) an  average  consumer  on
the Internet should be seen as "properly informed, sufficiently careful  and
sensible Internet user" therefore we  should  not  restrict  the  consumer's
liability for  violating  intellectual  property  rights  on  the  Internet.
Besides, we  disagree  with  demands  of  the  prohibition  on  the  use  of
technical measures to protect a work from  copying  it  or  illegal,  online
distribution.
One should remember of the  need  to  provide  rightholders  with  necessary
instruments (measures) of protection without which their market activity  is
exposed to losses and in the long perspective may  shake  the  profitability
of business. As a result,  the  State  loses  revenue  from  taxes  paid  by
legally operating companies, employees of these companies  lose  their  jobs
or the new ones are not created and the Internet pirates gain profits  as  a
result of committed crimnal-tax offences.  The  scale  of  the  impunity  of
organised crime based  on  income  gained  from  the  illicit  practices  is
staggering. The problem  illustrates  for  instance  a  fact,  that  in  the
"Transparency  Report"  prepared  by  Google,   Polish   entrepreneurs   are
constantly  on  the  leading  positions  in  terms  of  number  of  reported
copyright infringement claims in the world. It illustrates how huge  is  the
scale of piracy  in Poland.
In 2011 the number of offences in cases of Articles 6-7  of  the  Act  of  5
July 2002 on the protection of some services provided  by  electronic  means
based on or consisting of conditional access increased up to 425.  According
to the 2011 Poland Safety Report   prepared  by  the  Ministry  of  Internal
Affairs it is a 76  per  cent  increase  comparing  to  a  year  2010  (242)
http://www.msw.gov.pl/portal/pl/2/10205/Raport_o_stanie_bezpieczenstwa_w_Pol
sce_w_2011_roku.html
It should be emphasized  that  the  piracy  is  very  often  connected  with
traditional crime, especially  with  money  laundering.  For  the  effective
combat against this phenomenon a cooperation of all  the  Member  States  is
essential, but  it  is  not  enough.  With  this   in  mind,  we  hope  that
establishing the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)  at  Europol  would  bring
measurable benefits recalling as well that in harmony with  the  Council  of
Europe Convention on Cybercrime  of   23rd  November,  2001  the  notion  of
cybercrime  also  applies  to  offences   associated  with  infringement  of
copyright and related rights.
In  order  to  ensure  transparency  of  principles  of  the  protection  of
intellectual property rights for rightholders as well as for  consumers,  it
is necessary to clarify the concept of a digital copy and  provide  a  clear
definition of boundaries between fair personal use and public  use  both  at
the  national  and  the  European  level.  Dilluting  this  division  to  an
unspecified number of copies  and  covering  them  up  with  the  notion  of
"dissemination" brings substantial losses for rightholders including the  TV
operators which broadcasts are illegally transmitted  on  the  Internet.  We
disagree to the practice of offloading onto the society costs of the  piracy
by raising and widening  on  more  and  more  new  fields  and  objects  and
economic phenomena of so-called reprographic charges.

74. In particular, is the current legal framework   clear  enough  to  allow
  for  sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as  Internet  service
  providers, advertising brokers, payment service  providers,  domain  name
  registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online  copyright  infringements  with  a
  commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to  foster  the
  cooperation of intermediaries?

The role of intermediaries was so far unjustly marginalised. An analysis  of
the most popular pirate sites  shows  that  entities  handling  payments  or
service providers are often connected in terms of capital with  the  subject
who infringes the intellectual property rights and they play a key  role  in
gaining financial benefit from running “pirates’” services.  Profiting  from
intermediation they participate in creation of  a  chain  of  services  that
forms the illegal circulation of  content.  It  is  therefore  necessary  to
enforce regulations that would hinder the practice of provisioning  services
by intermediaries for entities that illegally make content available to  the
public.
When it comes to the business models of  the  pirate  services,  firstly  we
should mention the paid model when a user pays for services. These types  of
payment take the form of subscription for site or service or the content  of
a higher quality, transfer fees for collected data, "voluntary" tributes  to
service providers, etc. From the analysis made by Anti-Piracy Protection  it
turns out that 30 per cent of the most popular pirate  services  apply  paid
business model. This practice is  enabled  by  payment  intermediaries  like
operators,  brokers  etc.  The  second  model  business  enabling  to   gain
financial benefits from the ‘pirate’s  activity  is  an  advertising  model.
These type of services are being supplied  by  advertisements  supported  by
advertising networks, affiliation programs etc. Some of them allow  for  the
direct  publication  of  a  banner  on  the  service  website  without   the
participation of intermediaries but  it  is  very  uncommon  situation.  The
model based on transmission of commercials dominates as around  70%  of  the
most popular pirate services apply  it.  Some  entities  use  both  business
model simultaneously.
In order to  break  up  the  funding  scheme  of  “pirate’s”  practices  the
implementation of some mechanisms that would force  intermediaries  to  stop
cooperation with services that illegally distribute  content  are  required.
e.g. upon obtaining relevant information from rightholder.
It should be emphasized that as far as it comes to the  national  (domestic)
subjects that register the Internet domains’  names  there  is  no  rational
grounds for the extension of a liability of the intermediary as  defined  in
Directive  2001/29/EC  and  Directive  2004/48/EC.  Role  of  the   national
operator of the register  of  domains’  names   comes  down  to  support  of
delegations names on to the servers which are servicing the registered  name
of the Internet domain, and which can also indicate  the  WWW  web  service,
used for publications of  materials  infringing  the  intellectual  property
rights.
Simultaneously it should be noted that in the event where the specific  name
of the Internet domain infringes intellectual property  rights,  the  person
recognizing oneself as injured party can initiate  a  legal  action  against
third party, which registered the given name of the Internet domain, to  the
court or to the one of permanent arbitration courts, dealing with issues  of
Internet domains.
