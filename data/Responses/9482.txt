 NO OPINION

 What should be remembered is that copyright actually gives solutions to a number of problems that would otherwise be left to law of contracts, which is exactly the case in relation to sports rights. Removing the possibility of territorially restricting copyright licenses might not have the intended effect, but may instead lead to more complex contractual regulation which could limit the access to cultural content from other European countries.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations  -  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  -  sufficiently clear? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

The making available right should and does apply in the country of upload and every country of reception, regardless of whether that country is targeted. Access and reception is at the heart of the right.  We think this principle is legally correct and supports the policy objective.  We strongly reject the "country of origin" and "targeting" models.
 Reasons not to apply the "country of origin" model to making available:
1.	The impact assessment for the CRM Directive considered and rejected the application of the `"country of origin" model. It noted that: "identifying the "country of origin" may prove particularly challenging for online services, notably when they operate exclusively online on a MT basis.  No technical criteria could be used without risking a degree of arbitrariness: Works available for download are stored and mirrored on a myriad of servers located in a variety of locations across the world." The arbitrariness of server location would lead to confusion and complexity. Servers can be difficult to locate, then can easily be moved. Single online restricted acts can take place across multiple servers distributed across multiple jurisdictions (e.g. Google Spanner).
2.	The arbitrariness of server location would lead to enforcement problems. It would mean that copyright-infringing businesses could place their servers in jurisdictions with weak copyright law or poor judicial systems. So enforcement would become more difficult for rightholders. 
3.	A country of origin approach encourages "forum shopping". Regulatory arbitrage could impact licensing as well as enforcement.  

4.  The application of country of origin could predictably lead to further fragmentation of repertoire in collective management organisations. Faced with forum shopping and the legal uncertainty outlined above, rightsholders and collective management organisations ("CMOs") might well withdraw rights from other CMOs in order to safeguard a high level of protection for their rights.
5.	The right of communication to the public under Art. 8 WIPO Copyright Treaty 1996, which the Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC implements, provides for a right that takes place both at the place of transmission and the place of reception. This has been made clear by those who attended the diplomatic conference and by leading academics. See, for example: The WIPO Treaties 1996, Reinbothe & von Lewinski, (2002), The Law of Copyright and the Internet  -  The 1996 WIPO Treaties, their Interpretation and Implementation, Ficsor, (2002), International Copyright and Neighbouring Rights  -  The Berne Convention and beyond Ricketson & Ginsburg, 2nd Edition (2006) and World Copyright Law, Sterling 3rd Edn. (2008).
6.	The application of the "country of origin" model was applied to satellite broadcasting by a special, express provision (Art. 1(2) of Directive 93/83/EEC). The absence of such a provision in relation to other rights implies that this special model does not apply.
Reasons not to apply targeting to making available: 
1.	It is often very hard to determine whether a website that is hosting copyright content is "targeting" a particular country or not. Language is often cited as a test for whether a website is targeted. This is not an easy test to apply for websites in English that can be accessed and used throughout the EU.
2.	Targeting is irrelevant to whether a copyright-infringing site is prejudicing the rightholders' rights in a given jurisdiction. Consumers access and download from illegal sites whether or not the site is in a given language or has advertising using a certain currency. Copyright-infringing sites often disseminate illegal content without a sales transaction taking place.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

There is no practical problem relating to the territorial scope of the making available right as presented in answer to Q. 8 above. 
Please refer to the explanations in our answer to Q. 8 above. We believe that there are no practical problems relating to the substance of the right when protected works are used on a cross-border basis, as the right itself is harmonised at EU level. 
Considering that all EU member States and the European Union are party to the Berne Convention and the fact that the CJEU has to a great extent harmonised the relevant rules, the above question raises issues that seem to be only theoretical and have no practical impact while, on the contrary, the options discussed in the DeWolf Study could create serious problems in terms of effectively protecting and enforcing rights. We refer in particular to the country of origin principle and the targeting approach which are not acceptable for the reasons set out in answer to Q. 8.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

Many businesses handle the clearance of multiple rights with ease, online and offline: this has always been routine administration for any copyright business. Therefore, we see no evidence, either now or historically, that the existence of two rights has provided a barrier to the licensing of works.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public  -  or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

"Hyperlink" is a very generic technical term, and a general exception on linking to protected works would have huge consequences, and make numerous types of circumvention of copyright possible. Certain types of linking definitely constitute "making available". The rights holders should in these cases authorize the use. 
A general exception on linking could create an unwanted effect of limiting the licenses being granted for use of copyrighted works e. g. images and visual art on open websites and thus prove counterproductive in institutions efforts to make Europe's cultural heritage available to the public.


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user's computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO OPINION

The question is best suited to be decided by the EU Court of Justice whom will take into regard specificities of different situations, which is not suitable for legislative solution.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by giving examples
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO OPINION


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

Extending the principle of exhaustion to digital delivery would allow the first purchaser of a film or a musical album via digital transmission (e.g. download to own) to share it immediately and legally with audiences around the world who would not pay for the content they are viewing or listening to.
The shared file will be a perfect copy of the original, with a virtually unlimited life span and the ability to be further distributed to an unprecedented number of viewers and listeners through broadband computer networks accessible to all. 
The exhaustion principle was meant for physical bearers of copyright-protected content in the analogue world. No valid cultural or commercial consideration speaks in favour of extending it to the digital environment where it could completely undermine any commercial cultural production.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of works and other subject matter? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

Collective management organisations are already a source of comprehensive rights information and they are constantly working on addressing the evolving needs of the market. Their industry databases are dynamic and have the critical functionality to determine rights ownership status of the works at the time when they are used, and thus supporting efficient licensing and accurate payment. 
In order for a database to be effective and functional for licensing it needs to be dynamic, elaborate, fit for purpose and interoperable with the other metadata databases, reporting and dispute resolution processes used by the sector or industry.
Therefore, this issue can best be dealt with by the industry in each sector according to the needs of that sector in a way that is functional and purposeful for both users and right holders.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What would be the possible advantages of such a system? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

With regard to audio- and audio-visual works, a lot of works are created during or immediately before live broadcast and simultaneous retransmission.  The numerous contributors, and possible right holders in preexisting works used, in these work are impossible to know beforehand, and a registration system would not help the licensing of for instance cable-retransmission.
In relation to works existing prior to the creation of such a system, vast funds would be required, in order to have a covering registry.
The registry would not be operational before a very large share of the enormous number of existing works had entered into the system. Even then, the creation of an EU system could lead to a de facto "formality" for the protection of a work, as users could deny payment for the use of rights, in cases where works have not been registered, or single contributors in a work has wrongly not been registered. It is not feasible that a system could be accurate and operational enough to justify the enormous cost of establishing it.
As shown under question 15, collective management organizations have already well-functioning databases.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

With reference to the answers to Q. 15 and 17, DAF believes that the industries are guarantors to effective and dynamic registration systems. It is important to ensure that rights holders receive remuneration for the use of their works why identifiers is a useful tool. Therefore, the various industries where our members are represented in have developed registration systems. We are confident with the way it is administered.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?

* Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

The optional list and the differences between national rules implementing copyright exceptions do not present difficulties for the use of works, cross-border copyright licensing or the market for copyright works in general.  
Copyright owners routinely grant licences covering many jurisdictions, whether it is a group of territories, the entire EU or the world. At no time does the fact that an exception in one EU member state differs from the equivalent exception in another member state give rise to complexity or problems in practice.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

There is no reason to make some or all of the copyright exceptions mandatory.  Further harmonization would not deliver any tangible benefit to the Digital Single Market, since there are no problems in practice and no evidence in favour of change.  

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

There is no need for new limitations or exceptions.  Change should only be considered with strong supporting evidence and only if it is clear that licensing is not an appropriate option for clearing rights in the market.
We think the best approach is to seek to strengthen licensing solutions though positive and constructive initiatives such as licensing for Europe. 
Moreover, we also believe that collective licensing of rights is a better alternative to an exception since it provides users with an easier access to protected content, offers them with the needed legal certainty, while protecting the legitimate interest of rightsholders.
In several countries in the EU the concept of Extended Collective Licensing (ECL) is used as a tool to enable licensing in various areas where both users and the rights holder community benefit from easy access and payment for usages in areas where the rights holders might not be able to address the licensing directly.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain why 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

DAF believes there are no benefits in providing greater flexibility in the application of the limitations and exceptions. Indeed it is more likely to create greater uncertainty, which would increase commercial and litigation costs.  
The system for interpretation of law through the courts and CJEU has provided a line of cases interpreting the principles of directives.  
Specifically, the introduction of the fair use doctrine would not be an appropriate approach to introduce flexibility.  There is empirical evidence from the US of the high cost of litigation involving fair use. The costs mean that only the largest companies are confident to rely on the doctrine, with smaller users and smaller rights holders disadvantaged.  Even then, fair use is only workable in the US because of the substantial line of jurisprudence interpreting the concept. There is no case for implementation in the EU; this conclusion is backed up by the analysis in the De Wolf report. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question] 

A fair use exception does not fit with the European law tradition. Even in the USA, where common law is used, significant uncertainties still prevail, especially regarding new forms of use, even with decades of judgments concerning fair use. Periodic revision would be a problem as well, as revising the law could disrupt the perceived balance of thousands and thousands of contract concerning rights. DAF believes that specific exceptions combined with flexible licensing solutions will meet the demands of users, rights holders and the market better than a general fair use exception.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

DAF does not believe the territoriality of limitations and exceptions constitutes a problem for rights holders, businesses or consumers.  In fact consumers benefit from the main public policy exceptions in each territory, while the system allows for specific adaptation of exceptions in national laws in line with national policy.  

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of "fair compensation" be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [Open question]

DAF is of the opinion, that current EU law and international treaties provide the necessary flexibility for copyright and exceptions and limitations thereto. There is currently no need to introduce any new exception or to introduce a fair-use doctrine. 
Collective Management Organizations provide the necessary solutions through detailed licensing. The general Extended Collective Licensing provision in the Danish Copyright Act can and is frequently used as the legal foundation for an agreement between institutional users and the Collective Management Organizations. Both users and rights holders achieve in this manner a more flexible system. This was also a conclusion in the Commission's Licences for Europe project.
The Danish Ministry of Culture's website publishes their approvals relating to the management of both extended collective licenses and specific collective licenses: http://kum.dk/Kulturpolitik/Ophavsret/Godkendelser/. 
The Danish Ministry of Culture states it this way at their own website:
"Copyright is an important part of the knowledge economy. Well-balanced copyright makes it possible for the authors to earn a living from their works at the same time as securing the access of the general public to a wide range of these works. 
The task of the Ministry of Culture is to contribute to making copyright function as well as possible in practice. This work takes its point of departure in a Nordic legal unit and within the framework of EU directives and international conventions concerning the area. 
One of the special features of Danish copyright is the use of extended collective licenses, which make it possible to license the use of a large volume of works protected by copyright. The extended collective licenses are published on the website of the Ministry of Culture".

(a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide remote access, including across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of research and private study? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of the institutions in question?

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across borders,  to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private study?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

Collections in national institutes are often in the national language. Therefore there is no significant demand for access to Danish collections from other countries. In Denmark, there are numerous agreements regarding the mass use in libraries and archives. The budget of these are often linked to public service obligations  -  which are limited to the relevant member state, and their funding therefor does not allow for entering into cross-border licenses.
The general ECL provision in the Danish Copyright Act can be used as the legal foundation for an agreement between an institutional user and Copydan Writing (or another CMO) for giving access to a collection or parts thereof. 
It is mentioned in the explanatory notes to article 50,2, that the provision can be applied when wanting to digitize cultural heritage.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

The orphan works directive is being implemented in member states, and relevant stakeholders have agreed upon key principles on digitizing and making available of out-of-commerce works in 2011 MoU. There should be a follow up on the legal basis of the cross border availability as regards the 2011 MoU which would create more legal certainty and facilitate licensing.

If there are problems, how would they best be solved? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [Open question]

With the 2008 amendment to the Danish Copyright Act introducing the general Extended Collective Licensing (ECL) provision (sec. 50(2)), users such as libraries and collecting societies were enabled to enter into mass digitization projects. The provision was introduced as a means to help facilitate digitizing the Danish cultural heritages and mass digitization projects which include orphan works. Since 2008 the Danish CMO's (e.g. Copydan Writing) have entered into a number of licenses regarding mass digitization and making available.
The licenses that are based on the ECL system cover the use of works in Denmark. Such ECL licenses are limited to national use, because the extended collective licensing (ECL) only applies within the Danish territory. To be able to give such licenses cross-border effect, it would require that licenses based on ECL or other forms of collective rights management issued in one member state to be recognized in other member states. In the 2011 MoU it is written in preamble 11 that they are "calling on the European Commission, to the extent required to ensure legal certainty in a cross-border context, to consider the type of legislation to be enacted ...".
In Denmark the legislation is in place, but whether or not national legislation is required can only be answered when the EC introduces a solution in relation to the 2011 MoU.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

With the 2008 amendment to the Danish Copyright Act introducing the general ECL provision (sec. 50(2)), users such as libraries and collecting societies were enabled to enter into mass digitization projects. The provision was introduced as a means to help facilitate digitizing the Danish cultural heritages and mass digitization projects which include orphan works. Since 2008 the Danish CMO's (e.g. Copydan Writing) have entered into a number of licenses regarding mass digitization and making available.
The licenses that are based on the ECL system cover the use of works in Denmark. Such ECL licenses are limited to national use, because the extended collective licensing (ECL) only applies within the Danish territory. To be able to give such licenses cross-border effect, it would require that licenses based on ECL or other forms of collective rights management issued in one member state to be recognized in other member states. In the 2011 MoU it is written in preamble 11 that they are "calling on the European Commission, to the extent required to ensure legal certainty in a cross-border context, to consider the type of legislation to be enacted ...". 
In Denmark the legislation is in place, but whether or not national legislation is required can only be answered when the EC introduces a solution in relation to the 2011 MoU.

In Denmark, the system of ECL licensing agreements with schools, universities etc. functions very well to the benefit for both rightsholders and educational institutions. Licensing means flexibility and avoidance of uncertainty regarding the understanding of an exception limited to "illustration" for educational purposes.

In our experience, collective licensing facilitates easy and straight forward access to content, while ensuring the rightsholders are remunerated for the exploitation of their works.
There are licenses for numerous uses of audiovisual material in teaching, through the extended collective license (ECL) and individual mandates in Denmark. This includes the recording and streaming of TV and film in schools, by teachers and students. This also covers the use of large amounts of European content, which exceeds the actual demand, why cross-border access is not a pressing issue for schools.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

In Denmark, we apply extended collective licensing (ECL). Because ECL based licenses include all works of all artists of a defined type it can provide the broadest possible access to use of content and a high level of legal security for the users. At the same time it provides rightsholders with fair remuneration for the exploitation of their works and support that content creators are able and encouraged to continue creating new works. The system is accepted by both educational institutions and rights holders and has been for many years, which is the best testimony of its success.
The use of the ECL is consequently very successful, and enables Copydan to clear the rights for a lot of different uses in schools, but as mentioned individual mandate agreements are also used. The agreements are very successful, and the main licenses cover almost 100 % of all schools in Denmark.
Copydan in general collects annually millions of euro in remuneration to Danish and foreign rights holder for use of protected subject-matter in educational institutions. Hence, these funds are important for the possibility of producing and distributing new creative content to the benefit of the educational system. 
The development of the licenses is ongoing and occurs through continued discussions with the educational sector and the rightsholder organizations. 
All licenses allow the institutions to copy for educational purposes and for internal administrative use.

In our experience, collective licensing facilitates easy and straight forward access to content, while ensuring the rightsholders are remunerated for the exploitation of their works.
Also, uses for scientific and research purposes are licensed through the Extended Collective License (ECL) and as well as through individual mandates. 
We are of the opinion that current EU law and international treaties provide the necessary flexibility for copyright and exceptions and limitations thereto. There is currently no need to introduce any new exception or to make the available exceptions under InfoSoc Directive mandatory, since there is no evidenced need for such a legislative change. Moreover CMOs provide the necessary solutions through licensing solutions.

Please find below DAF's views on and answers to questions 58 to 63.
The question of User Generated Content (UGC) is an almost impossible question to address at a European legal level. Not only do we not have a commonly accepted definition of UGC, but since the issue has not yet been the focus of European court cases, lengthy surveys on the issue concluding that copyright provisions hinder the freedom of expression, or broadly accepted conclusions from the License for Europe initiative, it seems an impossible  -  and highly unnecessary  -  initiative to introduce provisions regulating this. And definitely impossible on these grounds to introduce an EU-exemption on UGC use.
One of many questions that arise when investigating UGC is that the initial use might be initiated by a private individual, but the distribution to the public takes place in forums controlled by highly commercial global internet service providers (ISP's). These ISP's do not accept any responsibility for the content on their platforms, but hide behind the provisions of the E-commerce directive, which makes it very hard for authors and their representatives to make licensing agreements about the use (and micro-use).
Another important question is the very different perception of the use the author can have compared to the user. What might seem non-commercial to the user can very well be commercial for the author and provide a means of income for him/her in the years to come.
The author will also have an interest in being able to control how the work is being used according to the droit moral rules and this need has repeatedly been stated in various copyright conventions, such as the Bern convention, the Humans Rights convention etc. A film director or a writer or journalist will have a clear legal and personal interest in being able to protect the work, and the way the work is presented. Not to mention the importance of any democratic European society of being introduced to credible information that has a clear "return address". 
Notwithstanding the above mentioned arguments, many European countries have private use provisions in their copyright legislation which thoroughly regulate the possibility for private individual's to express themselves through UGC. In almost all of these countries there exists CMO's who are more than willing to issue licensing deals for the use  -  especially in the area of music. What is needed is the acknowledgment that this use can be potentially detrimental to the author (and in the end to the society) and provisions that take this fact into account. The making of yet another exemption does not solve the issue.

There is at present no need to clarify the scope of private copying, since the EU court (CJEU) in a number of both resolved and pending cases have been asked to give the needed interpretation of the private copying exceptions. Cases such as the Amazon ruling (C-521-11), the Padawan case (C-476/08), the Opus decision (C462/09), the VG Wort decision (C-457/11-460/11) and the pending Copydan case (C463/12) have (and will) clarify potential legal uncertainties.

It is very important to bear in mind that the existence of exclusive rights/contractual rights/licensing schemes in no way is contradictory to the possibility for member states to have private copy levies schemes.

* Fair remuneration of authors and performers

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]  

DAF believes that best mechanism to ensure audio-performers an adequate remuneration for primary exploitation is strong exclusive rights. Nevertheless, regarding secondary uses, DAF does recognize that the best way to ensure performers is a combination of exclusive rights and remuneration rights.
It is, however, important to take into account the special circumstances in the audio field.
Different audio performers earn their living in different ways. Whereas session musicians receive a fee when they go into the studio, featured artists on the other hand rely on royalties. And often royalties are only paid after recoupment of recording and marketing costs. It is important to underline that these conditions are not related to the level of income of performers. The described structures does not merely apply to top-selling artists with substantial revenues but, indeed also to low-level artists, upcoming artists and artists performing niche-repetoire, who are currently struggling to make a living at all from their recordings.
The cash flow regarding primary exploitations has been like this for decades in the audio field. This has been the case, both for traditional sale and in relation to new exploitations that will over time substitute physical phonograms, e.g. on demand services such as iTunes and Spotify.
When the market evolves in a manner where one primary use replaces another, it is important that the legal framework supports that the balance between different stakeholders can be upheld. Should a remuneration right be introduced, it is consequently important that this new right does not destabilize existing models to the detriment of featured artists. In the audio field many European performers may have a need for a supplementary remuneration right to provide them with a much needed income in respect of the use of their performances on the internet. It is important, however, that existing regimes of individual or collective bargaining for primary royalties applying to featured artists should not be undermined, and that the unwaivable remuneration right against users for online exploitation should in practice supplement existing exclusive rights, whether or not they have been transferred or assigned to the producer for a primary royalty.
Thus, it is of utmost importance that a new legal framework does not put the featured artists' rights and current income from primary uses under pressure, without a legal certainty that their share of a supplementary remuneration compensates the decline in primary income.
In relation to more secondary exploitations that will over time substitute e.g. broadcast as we know it today and similar secondary uses, it is in DAFs opinion more difficult to secure audio performers payment, solely on the basis of exclusive rights. With respect to such uses, audio performers typically constitute a more homogenous group with a similar cash flow. Accordingly, there is not the same need to take the balance between different categories of performers into account in the secondary markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

The civil enforcement system in the EU should be made more efficient so as to effectively address and deter services that offering infringing material to their users, whether funded by subscription, donation or advertising.  These types of services should not be entitled to the immunity from liability offered by the Article 14 hosting exception of the E-Commerce Directive.  The Directive was intended to award immunity to particular activities carried out by neutral internet intermediaries and recital 42 of the Directive refers to a protected service as being "merely technical, automatic and passive."
The current system of notice and take down puts all the resource and financial burdens on rights holders while services have no incentive to assist in detection of illegal content, even through the technological means are available.  
There are technological measures available for service providers to allow them to easily and effectively identify files and infringements, based on prior notifications given to them by rights holders.  Many services now employ such measures, but unfortunately most providers still do not adopt this technology or take these steps. 
The system of notice and takedown is ineffective to address the problem of illegal content appearing online. Once files have been removed through a notice and takedown procedure, they can quickly re-appear: either being re-uploaded by the same internet user, or by a different user of the same online service, or alternatively by a user of an entirely different online service or platform.
We need clarification that the hosting exemption is only available to particular activities which are merely technical, automatic and passive, where carried out by neutral online services, and not to platforms which are designed or optimised to make available or facilitate the making available of illegal content, such as material which infringes copyright.
Also, we need clarification that notice and takedown means "notice and stay down" and that service providers are required to remove not only an example URL but all instances of the specific infringement or illegal content once they are notified and/or become aware

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough to allow for  sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We believe that the legal framework which establishes the liability of intermediaries has created the wrong balance. It creates incentives for intermediaries to be entirely passive so as to avoid liability for licensing.  They have no incentive to inform their customers and consumers or to help with awareness and education of consumers.  The notice and take down system is placing a burden on rights holders but is not operating to its full benefit.  The responsibility of other intermediaries, such as advertising or payment services, must be more clearly defined, perhaps in the form of a joint agreement or MOU to ensure they take active role in preventing their services being used to support unauthorized and illegal businesses.

Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question] 

No, the differences between Member States' legislation are not problematic. The addition of a second, parallel EU copyright title is unnecessary and would create confusion and cost. The existing EU legislative acts already ensure a high standard of copyright protection.
Also, it is widely recognized and also mentioned several times in the DeWolf Study that the rights provided by copyright already to a great extent are harmonized at EU level. They also follow in most instances the EU's international obligation under copyright treaties.
We recognize that there may be some theoretical benefits in establishing a European copyright code but it is not clear that it would deliver a single market in practice.  Also, a single copyright title would not per se deliver a single market to consumers.  The factors that divide markets now, such as language, culture, or inhibit roll out of services, such as payment systems, will continue despite changes to IP and they are the critical challenge for policy makers. Therefore, at a time when the efforts and actions of policy makers across Europe are better focused on practical solutions, we believe the copyright code is not a priority.

Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

A secure copyright regime is essential to Europe's economic stability, future growth, and the cultural diversity of the EU.  This is because it ensures that creators are paid for the use of their works and incentivises them to free up access to works, which in turn stimulates innovation, investment and ultimately the creation of new works.  
Any programme which seeks to ensure a copyright framework for digital markets must be based on two primary objectives.  First, to facilitate a rights regime which means consumers can legally access content, when and how they want it.  Secondly, and importantly, ensure that rights holders are fairly remunerated in a digital market when their works are used and monetized by other providers.     
The value generated by digital technologies that owe their success mostly to access to creative works is not fairly shared with the creators of those works. There is a transfer of value in favour of technical intermediaries in the online environment and adequate remuneration of authors and artists, and rights holders in general, for the use of their works on digital platforms is not secured. The digital exploitation involves its own players - host providers, access providers, search engines, etc. which generate high revenues thanks to the use of copyright protected works and demand of consumers for `broader'-bands to use creative works. 
The activity of many of these service providers is not limited to a mere conduit or stocking of information: they are designed to make content available, organise the means they put at the public's disposal to access such content, develop special search engines, develop software to enable consumers to view and listen to the content, seek to develop the widest audience possible and seek to valorize the access given to protected content through advertising strategies. These intermediaries carry out acts of reproduction and/or of communication to the public for which they would be considered liable if they did not benefit from the "safe harbour regime" under the E-commerce Directive.
We believe there remain significant questions whether the current framework is creating sufficient value for rights holders. The current digital ecosystem allows providers and intermediaries to monetize rights protected works without adequately remunerating rights holders.  If the EU is to continue to enjoy the benefits, in jobs and economic growth, of a world leading cultural sector this must be addressed
