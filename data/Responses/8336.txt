     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore

modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).



9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of

content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)

2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
         - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
The biggest problem right owners face when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU is the
vast amount of easily accessible illegal content. This has a direct impact on the willingness of investors to invest
in online services and the Commission should take an urgent look at the impact piracy has on the development of
new services. Recommendations as to the measures the Commission should implement can be found in our
response to Q75 and 76.

4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
   YES – Please explain by giving examples
Problems with territoriality, and a supposed incompatibility with the digital single market, are often cited as
reasons to re-open the Directive.
While some sectors license on a pan-European or even global basis, many rights owners sell rights on a territory
by territory basis for a number of reasons. However, where it makes sense, financially and culturally, such pan-
European licences exist.      For example, the music industry issue multi-territory licences to companies like
Spotify, Deezer or iTunes, allowing their customers access to their music outside their home countries.
Sports broadcasters and the film and TV industry do not always license in such a pan-European way for a
number of non-copyright related reasons.
The most important reason why a rights owner may license territory by territory will be to provide the return on
investment required to fund the production of the content. The financial eco-system of, say, a film or TV
programme is such that it is usually not possible to secure 100% of the funding needed to finance the production
from a single source. Instead, production begins with the funds available and, using the ‘promise’ of the high
quality content being produced, further funding is then achieved via the selling of rights for a specific territory
on a territory by territory basis. If such territory-specific licensing was not possible then the level of funding that
could be achieved would be grossly reduced, thereby significantly reducing the viability of the production.
Damaging, in such a way, how finance is generated is not in consumers’ interests as it will result in lower quality
and less content being made.
For sport, member states have heritage in different sports. It would not make commercial sense, for example, for
the England and Wales Cricket Board to be required to sell a pan-European licence.
Even for football, pan-European licensing doesn’t necessarily work. In past calls for tender, the Premier League
offered a pan-European licence but has never received a single bid. If the Premier League was legally required
to only sell its rights in such a way, numerous single country broadcasters would not be able to afford to buy this
leading UK content. This, in turn, would likely lead to a reduction in consumer choice in these countries and an
increase in price for many consumers (at present the Premier League is able to sell rights to certain matches to a
broadcaster in a country which has a potential small audience for a lot less than they sell the rights to, say, Sky or
BT in the UK).
Film and television programmes have similar cultural differences across Europe, resulting in different audience
levels according to the country and the film or TV show. Viacom first launched MTV in Europe as a single pan-
European channel. However, due to member states having different cultural heritages, different consumer tastes
and needs, this has since been devolved, with bespoke MTV channels launched in each country. The
Commission must recognise that a single European licence is not always in the best interest for consumers’ and
it must ensure that the system remains flexible enough to take account of this.



                                                                                                                     9
Likewise, many businesses launch services on a territory by territory basis. Again the reasons for doing so are
varied and not related to copyright. Marketing and promoting new services requires significant investment.
Adapting technical coding to take into account different IT infrastructures, languages and content regulation
requires the time and attention of skilled professionals. A new online service may simply not have the resources
and finances available to launch in every European market simultaneously, as it would be required to recoup
investment on a pan-European licence. The only services likely to be able to fund such licences would be large
global companies, placing smaller domestic services at a disadvantage.
It is also very important for new services to be able to test a market and be able to take into account consumer
feedback. This is why, even though they have a pan-European licence, services such as iTunes and Google Play
have opted to roll out their service across Europe in stages, as opposed to launching simultaneously in all
member states. In addition, some services are designed to be regional and, therefore, have no need of a pan-
European licence. The Commission should not mandate pan-European licences, as ultimately it will make the
provision of territorial licences less attractive, reduce consumer choice and leave purchasing power to acquire
rights and build platforms in the hands of large global businesses.

6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
         – Please explain by giving examples

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
   YES – Please explain
There are a number of non-legislative measures which could be introduced which would increase the cross-
border availability of content services. In response to Q2 we highlighted the damage caused by piracy. If rights
owners were better able to protect their IP rights, this in turn would make the development of new services more
financially attractive and viable. Please see our response to Q75 and Q76 for further recommendations in this
area.
However, measures that would really increase availability lie outside the IP framework. For example, the lack of
harmonisation of VAT causes confusion and complexity for online retailers, resulting in making content
available cross-border a less attractive business activity. Differences in consumer protection regulations and
mobile roaming charges are all issues which directly impact the availability of content across borders.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online

9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
Alliance members are clear that the “making available” right is sufficiently clear, based on the current Directive
and subsequent decisions from the EUCJ and are therefore extremely concerned that any changes would result in
it being weakened. This right must remain in the country of upload AND access, not just in the country of origin
and apply everywhere that the content can be accessed, not just the market to which it was targeted. The impact
on the ability to license new and evolving digital services as well as enforcement, should this change, would be
significant. In terms of enforcement, problems would be caused because:
-     Servers can be moved swiftly and in an arbitrary way
-     Pirate websites will move their servers to countries which have weak IP regimes
-     Unlike the marketing of physical goods, it is difficult to tell whether a website is targeting a particular
      country or market. In the context of digital content and the internet this is also irrelevant, given the
      immediate receipt of the content.

2.         Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the

   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

3.       Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
  YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why
Websites that index hyperlinks to infringing content present a huge commercial problem for rights owner as
evidenced by R v Vickerman (a successful private prosecution the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT)
brought against Anton Vickerman who was running a site called Surf the Channel). Vickerman was found guilty
of conspiracy to defraud and sentenced to 4 years imprisonment. These websites profit from advertising
surrounding such links while diverting consumers from legal offers. Vickerman was making £50,000 a month. It
is important that the legal framework clearly ensures that rights owner can enforce their rights against such sites
and support services that legally provide links to content made legitimately available.
In our view, the provision of a hyperlink should be subject to the authorisation of the rights owner when it links
to content that infringes copyright, content behind a paywall or content where website terms restrict linking.
EUCJ decisions on “making available” and the impending decisions on linking give the necessary guidance on
when linking constitutes making available, therefore no changes to the legislative framework are necessary.
The UK High Court adopted this approach in Football Association Premier League Ltd v British Sky
Broadcasting Ltd & Ors [2013] EWHC 2058 (Ch), reasoning that a link to such content is a communication to

the public because it gives access to a ‘new public’, one not taken into account by the rights owner (Football
Association Premier League, Case C-403/08, paragraph 197).
We acknowledge that search engines play a vital role in the infrastructure and navigation of the internet and
suggest that the rules applicable to search engines are given separate consideration. Though search engines must
act responsibly and accountably, blanket liability for all links to infringing content may not be a practical
outcome.
In this regard, effective causes of action and remedies should be to deter and stop bad actors who provide
hyperlinks solely for the purpose of pointing users to illegal material, including copyright infringing content.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
  YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why
Yes, a reproduction of a work on a user’s computer screen or cache should require the authorisation of the right
holder. However, in certain circumstances where content has been placed on the open internet with the right
holder’s authorisation, there must be an implied licence to view it, so the authorisation for temporary screen and
cache copies has been given (as per Article 5(1) of the Copyright Directive provided it is for a lawful use, i.e.
where the copies do not stem from illegal sources or are designed to enable an unlawful use).
The implied licence may also be constrained by the website terms and conditions preventing, for example, use as
part of a commercial enterprise which the right holder may himself wish to exploit. If the copies made by users
for viewing unauthorised content were to become legal, it would send out a damaging message that copyright
infringement is legal and acceptable. This would undermine legal business models. A copyright exception that
covered such copies would not be compliant with the Three-Step Test as such copies are not a ‘special’ case (i.e.
narrow in scope), would conflict with normal exploitation and prejudice legitimate interests of right holders.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

4.         Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can

27
     See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                                                                                                              14
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO
     NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
Changing the legal framework to enable the resale, either commercially or privately, of digital content would be
seriously damaging to not only rights owners but creators and, through the reduction in revenues to invest in new
content, to consumers.
A digital file is not the same as a physical product. It does not degrade and copying it results in a perfect copy,
indistinguishable from the original. For example, a second- hand book can become battered, torn and well-
thumbed. Such a less-than- perfect product is not competing on a comparable level with a brand new copy of the
same book and therefore a valid secondary market exists. However, a copy of an e-book would be exactly the
same even if you purchased it ‘second-hand’. This would have a dramatic impact on pricing, as its quality would
remain the same no matter how many times it was resold. In addition, even if the number of times a piece of
content was sold meant that the overall total sales value achieved for that content remained the same, the vast
majority of these sales would see no revenue to the creator, thus making earning a living from creating content
very difficult.
It would also create significant enforcement problems as, unlike with physical products whose ownership is
obviously relinquished once sold, it is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to confirm that the seller no longer
holds the original digital file.
We also question how such a move would comply with international obligations under TRIPs and meet the
requirements of the Three-Step-Test given that, for the reasons outlined above, this would certainly conflict with
the normal exploitation of the work.

C.        Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.


28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                                15
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
     NO
     NO OPINION


16.        What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
17.        What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
A number of initiatives are underway, designed to help in the identification and licensing of works. Importantly,
these are all voluntary and for the most part industry-led. This is crucial, given copyright’s established legal
position as an unregistered right. The Berne Convention and TRIPS are both clear that registration or any other
formal requirements are not necessary to protect copyrighted works.
The UK is already making great strides in this area with the creation of a Copyright Hub
www.copyrighthub.co.uk. When completed, the Hub will be a portal with intelligent connections to a wide
range of websites, digital copyright exchanges and databases in the UK and around the world, with the focus on
making copyright licensing easier in the digital age. A parallel EU system is not needed and would result in
unnecessary bureaucracy. Instead, the Commission could play a valuable role in evaluating the different systems
in existence and consider initiatives to link these together.

D.         How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are



29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                              16
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
See answer to Q17. Identifiers are being adopted and expanded. The Commission could play a valuable role in
funding the development of some of these initiatives and promote them across member states.

E.       Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain

     NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there

   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
38
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
39
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            18
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
   YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
   NO – Please explain
The Alliance represents 23 UK trade associations representing businesses across the music, audiovisual,
publishing, video games, software and visual art industries. The fact that most limitations and exceptions are
optional for member states has not been raised as a problem by members; neither has the fact of differently
implemented exceptions created any problems as the Directive is clear as to the purpose of the exception. The
current system provides flexibility as to how the exception or limitation is implemented, which allows for
differences in legal traditions and existing law to be taken into account.
   NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
   YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
   NO – Please explain
There is no need for some or all of the exceptions to be made mandatory. The European legal system co-exists
alongside national legislation and legal systems in each of the 28 member states. As explained in response to
Q21, in the absence of any evidence that the current framework is creating problems the status quo must be
retained.
   NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
No new exceptions are required.

First, as explained earlier, the current set of exceptions allow for flexibility and were arrived at following lengthy
discussions and negotiations to ensure that the interests of rights owners and citizens were both protected.
Copyright is a property right and, as such, any intervention on the part of government requiring the owner of that
property to allow others to use and access it without permission or payment must be undertaken only where there

                                                                                                                  19
is a clear need for such use/access, an absence of any other market-led solution and following a full and thorough
assessment of the economic impact.

Second, licensing and technology is developing in such a manner as to make further exceptions unnecessary.
Exceptions are a blunt tool and legislating for them a lengthy process. Licensing allows for a more nuanced
approach to be taken which takes on board different needs of creators, businesses and citizens.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
   YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
   NO – Please explain why
As discussed above, there is no need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility. The current system allows for
member states to implement the exceptions in a manner which bests suits their individual requirements. We
would be interested to see any evidence which is contrary to this view and supports such a need.
‘Greater flexibility’ would lead to greater uncertainty. This would impact investment decisions and result in
increased litigation costs. The result would be a legislative framework weighted in favour of large companies
with litigation war chests over small businesses, start-ups and individual creators.
   NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the

A.        Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.        Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to

3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible

a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-

B.       Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework


45
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with

implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

E.       Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to

F.       User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort

53
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           30
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
Alliance members are clear that no legislative change is needed to accommodate people uploading user
generated content (UGC) onto social media and other platforms, for reasons explored further in our answer to
Q63. The current framework has not prevented the explosion in UGC content and it also allows for licensing
schemes, such as that which exists with YouTube, to evolve. This ensures users can upload content while
ensuring rights owners who have logged (or ‘claimed) content under the scheme to receive payment. The
importance of this is evidenced by that fact that, in a changing market, YouTube is the third largest source of
digital revenues for the music industry. This is a business-to-business arrangement between the rights owner and

exception.
However, even though licensing arrangements are in place with YouTube, Alliance members report that a
number of sites are refusing to take a licence, citing the Hosting Defence (Directive 2000/31/EC, Article 14).
This needs to be looked at and UCG sites should be encouraged to engage in licensing.

61.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Any perceived problems with citizens’ increased engagement with UCG and their desire to share and
disseminate such content can be solved by licensing arrangements under the current framework. An additional
measure that may assist consumers would be for hosting websites to be obliged to display their licence. This
would allow users to know whether it was legal for them to upload another’s copyright content to the web or not.
Such information would play an important part in educating users and enable them to make a better informed
choice about whether to upload or not.

elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?

63.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Legislation, whether via a new exception or other method, is not needed. Such regulatory intervention where a
licensing / market solution exists would be a gross interference in rights owners’ ability to receive remuneration
for uses of their works and be too blunt a tool when a solution is already in place.

UCG sites are commercial entities. Therefore, the only beneficiaries, were an exception to be introduced, would
be these businesses. Creators would lose out as they would no longer receive revenue from their content being
used. Consumers would be unaffected as rights owners’ ability to license such sites has no impact whatsoever
on their actions.




     IV.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

     VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
Whilst, on the whole, the civil enforcement system in the EU works well, there are a number of things the
Commission could do to make it more efficient.
Ensure that Article 8(3) is properly implemented in all Member States. The UK implemented Art 8(3) via
section 97A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. Using this provision rights owners in the UK have
successfully blocked websites which were causing significant damage to legitimate businesses by distributing or
linking to illegal content. The BPI alone has blocked 25 websites and their associated proxies and the film
industry 11. Such injunctive relief, as required by the Directive, is not available in all Member States. This
makes the ability of rights owners to enforce their rights inconsistent.
Ensure that the EU’s enforcement framework is properly implemented across the Member States. At the
moment, the Enforcement Directive is not consistently implemented across the EU – especially with regard to
damages, which should both compensate for the damage suffered by the rights owner and also have a deterrent
effect for IP theft.
Ensure rights owners are able to access the injunctive relief provided for in 8(3) at a speed which is
necessary to stop the harm the infringement is causing. This is of particular importance in instances of illegal
streaming of live content. For rights owners such as the UK Premier League the value in their content is in
watching live matches. Therefore, they need to be able to stop an illegal stream extremely quickly.
Create an EU-wide centre of excellence dealing with online IP infringement. The cross-border nature of
online crime creates challenges for law enforcement. The UK realised this on a national level (responsibility for
IP crime traditionally lying with regional trading standards units) and created a national Police IP Crime Unit
(PIPCU). Operating out of the City of London Police, this unit is dedicated to combatting online IP crime. In
the short time it has been operationally it has already achieved significant success. However, just as online IP

66
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
67
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                              37
crime doesn’t respect UK local authority boundaries, neither does it respect national boundaries. A dedicated
centre within Europol or the EU Observatory on the Infringement of IP Rights tasked with pulling together
intelligence would greatly increase law enforcement and rights owners’ ability to stop this criminal activity.
Encourage member states to adopt rules for small claims proceedings. The UK has introduced an enhanced
fast track for small claims which is designed to makes the court process cheaper and easier. It de-formalises the
process and allows parties involved to participate without lawyers. Smaller companies often feel excluded from
the legal system and find enforcing their rights too costly and time consuming. The EU must ensure that
companies of all sizes have access to justice.

   NO OPINION

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
The ease with which people can find and access illegal content online remains a huge problem for rights holders
and represents unfair competition to legal online services. We believe there is a valuable role for the EU to play
in ensuring the online environment is one which is safe for consumers and fair for businesses.
Intermediaries are important partners in tackling infringement:
- Search engines enable fraudsters to attract internet users to their sites offering access to illegal digital content
- ISPs’ services are being used to illegally share copyright protected content via peer-2-peer networks
- Online sites are hosting or facilitating the online distribution of protected works without the consent of rights
owners
- Advertisers are serving adverts to illegal sites thereby providing their operators with the revenue that enables
them to make profits without investing in the industry or paying producers
- Payment service providers are allowing their services to be used to purchase illegal content
There are a number of measures the Commission could implement which would not require the Enforcement
Directive to be reopened but would have a positive impact on rights owners’ ability to protect their content from
commercial infringers.
Clarify against whom injunctions are possible. The development of the internet has led to more services
which potentially fall into the Enforcement Directive’s definition of intermediary. The Commission should
make it clear that injunctions are possible against all of these parties. This would not change the rule around
liability and would not require a review of the safe harbour provisions under the E-Commerce Directive; a court
would still be required to assess whether an injunction is appropriate in the specific circumstances. It is vital,
however, as rights owners need to be able to seek appropriate injunctive relief from those entities best placed to
stop infringing activity.
Encourage the development of voluntary arrangements. The UK is seeing significant success with the
creation of voluntary agreements between intermediaries and rights owners. For example, during an innovative
three month pilot where the City of London Police and the creative and advertising industries worked together to
reduce the number of adverts from legitimate companies appearing on pirate websites, the number of adverts
from well-known brands across 61 websites which had been identified as infringing decreased by 12%. Similar
work is underway with the payment service providers.
Promote initiatives which raise awareness of the importance of intellectual property and educate the
public as to where to find legal content. A major problem for both consumers and rights owners is the
continuing appearance of illegal sites in search results. Representatives of content industries have developed a

                                                                                                                     38
number of initiatives to aid consumers in their search for legal sources of content. PRS for Music has promoted
a ‘Traffic Lights’ system for search engines which would inform users which sites were legal. The Alliance has
also developed a web portal which lists legal services across music, audiovisual, ebooks, video games and sports
broadcasts. The Content Map (www.thecontentmap.com) also provides information on copyright via FAQs and
jargon busting sections. A Dutch version has recently been launched at www.thecontentmap.nl.
Require hosting providers and domain registries to have in place robust data verification procedures.
While it is relatively easy to identify the ISP used to host an infringing website, problems often arise in finding
out who is actually responsible for the site itself. Inadequate checks are undertaken by the hosting provider and
domain registrars to confirm that the site operator’s/registrant’s information, personal and financial, is correct.
The Commission should also work with ICANN to ensure the information on the WHOIS database is correct and
up- to- date.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
