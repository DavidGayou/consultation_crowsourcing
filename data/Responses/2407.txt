            Dear Ms ma, (LeJ1m1Z_%.
                       /              7/
            BUSINESSEUROPE welcomes the Commission public consultation on the review of
            the EU copyright rules. A well-functioning copyright system including effective
            enforcement is a key enabler for the development of the Digital Single Market.
            BUSINESSEUROPE will not provide a detailed response to the Commission
            questionnaire but would like to share some key observations on the future of the EU
            copyright policy.

            We believe that a fit-for-purpose EU copyright policy needs to be based on a long-term
            vision going beyond a single Commission term while ensuring the principle of
            continuity. Any legislative proposals that the Commission might decide to put forward in
            this area need to be evidence-based.

            We have repeatedly voiced the need of a flexible legislative framework that facilitates
            and is a driving force for the digital economy. EU businesses should be able to
            compete at a level-playing field with non-EU players under clear and enabling rules.

            Any harmonisation of the copyright legislation designed to adapt it to the digital
            environment must take into account participation of all parties involved in delivering
            digital content and fostering the Digital Single Market. This should extend to authors,
            creators, rightholders, users, service providers and other industry players in the
            copyright value chain as regards their investment in new technologies. Rules should
            strike a balance between providing rightholders with a high level of protection and the
            development of innovation in the digital economy. Illegal downloads on a large scale
            can jeopardize the development of an economically viable Digital Single Market.
            Therefore, the increase of legal offers is essential to strike the balance mentioned
            above.

            In this context, fair reward for rightholders should be ensured as it also contributes to
            the development of new business models and the evolution of the Digital Single
            Market. At the same time, the recommendations of the EU Mediator Mr Antonio

Vitorino on private copying levies in Europe should be taken into consideration,
including possible alternatives to device-based levies systems.

Any review of the copyright regime must take into account the consequences of
harmonising exceptions having an impact on the Single Market. This is a prerequisite
for legal certainty for all interested parties. The consideration of future exceptions to
adapt to technological developments should be evidence-based and only if licensing
cannot achieve the same results. Any new exceptions should follow the same test as
under Directive 2001129/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May
2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the
information society and should be introduced on a harmonised basis.

We are looking forward to continuing a positive dialogue with the Commission on the
future steps it might decide to undertake in the area of copyright.
