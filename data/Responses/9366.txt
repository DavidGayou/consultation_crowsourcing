Introduction




Orange thanks the European Commission for the opportunity to provide inputs to its public
consultation on the review of the European copyright rules.

Orange would like to reaffirm that copyright is fundamental to innovation and copyright
owners need to be properly remunerated for their works. As part of an innovative industry,
Orange supports a sound regulatory framework for copyright and an appropriate protection
mechanism. But the current regulatory framework for copyright faces many challenges in
the internet era. Orange thus believes it is appropriate that the European Commission
questions the adequacy of the current regime in the digital context.

We would also like to highlight that Information and Communication Technologies are an
enabler of new content distribution mechanisms and services bringing enormous
opportunities. As such, Orange is investing heavily to ensure that the underlying
infrastructure is in place to support this innovation and believes that all players benefitting
from the digital environment should contribute to its growth and investment.

In the following, Orange provides insights on the questions which are relevant to Orange’s
activities, namely: provision of content, exceptions and limitations to copyright, copyright
levies and enforcement of rights.




Answers


Question 2: Have you faced problem when seeking to provide online services across
border in the EU?



Although Orange operates in seven countries of the European Union1, cross-border trade is
currently limited in our organization. Copyright is one of the reasons of such limited
development but barriers to cross-border trade go far beyond copyright issues.

Cross-border availability of content is essential for the development of cross-border services
and must be facilitated: 1/ when customers that have subscribed to online services in the
Member State of their residence want to access these services when travelling abroad (via
roaming, Wi-Fi connections, fixed access, etc.); 2/ when customers wish to access content
distributed by a provider based in another country. Orange shares the view that European
customers need a content single market.

The fact that copyright and licensing are national-based is an obstacle to the achievement of
the European single market. But series of other obstacles do exist such as the existence of
national cultures and languages; the need for the adoption of open standards for content
delivery; the cost of compliance with different national consumer protection laws and fiscal
regulations; the cost of providing customer care and customer complaints in several
languages; the risk of fraud and non-payments and the diverse economic realities which
make a single price impossible.




4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above –what
would be the best way to tackle them? [Open question]



  I.    Identified issues
National cultures and languages

European content is nationally segmented because content is related to national cultures
and languages. This is particularly true for audio-visual works. Subtitling and dubbing films
helps to overcome these difficulties but these solutions carry a cost which online distributors
are not always able to support, especially when consumers’ interest is low. Also for
marketing and budget reasons, European works are not as attractive as US ones outside
their country of origin. This is true not only for television programs (news, games, etc.), but
also for most films.

Distributors will typically not take the risk of financing films produced in other Member
States as it is also difficult for those distributors to find interested advertisers. In this context
and considering these barriers, distributors are legitimately reluctant to undertake
international online provision of content in other Member States of the European Union.



Standards for content delivery

Standardization is necessary to achieve convergence in the audio-visual business. These
standardization processes should involve all the stakeholders of the value chain, from
content providers to Internet Service Providers and home network technology vendors,
including transit network operators. This is crucial to make cross-border distribution to end
users efficient.

Industry initiatives are important and should be accompanied by institutional efforts focused
on achieving and ensuring adoption of open standards for online services. The European
Commission should nonetheless refrain from mandating any standard which has not proven
to be widely accepted by the market in terms of market share and sales figures. Indeed,
mandating standards can hinder innovation.

The promotion of standards via bodies such as ETSI could foster market penetration of
standards on a voluntary basis and thereby help to achieve more interoperability. This
definitively enhances the competitiveness of telecom and content industries in the European
Union.

                                                    3/13
Many standardisation activities are developed in order to enable the provisioning of
NGA/NGN services across networks in a multi-carrier environment. Some of these standards
dedicated to the future networks could also facilitate content delivery and online
distribution of audio-visual media services.

As identified by one of the 11 proposals of the industry in their “How to achieve the 2020
European Digital Targets”, there is an immediate need for Europe to promote open and
interoperable standards for IP-based Quality of Service Interconnection (such as IPX) as well
as for next generation bit-stream access and other NGA products. They are essential to
enable the provisioning of NGA/NGN services across networks in a multi-carrier
environment.



Consumer protection law

Notwithstanding the Citizen Rights Directive2 to be implemented this summer, the laws
regulating consumer contracts are varied across Member States. This constitutes an obvious
barrier to cross-border trade. The lack of harmonisation generates legal uncertainty for
service providers, as well as additional costs, and impedes the development of cross-border
online distribution of works.



Personal data protection and privacy

Creating, promoting and adopting a global set of principles based on a harmonised and
consistent approach to privacy would primarily benefit users. Enjoying the same level of
protection no matter where the websites are based is a crucial issue. European businesses
should also be able to compete on the same level playing field with non-European market
leaders. Harmonisation would greatly reduce privacy compliance costs, which is an
important step for the take-up of new activities, such as cloud computing, in the European
Union.

On this issue, Orange welcomes the ambitious plan to revise European data protection rules,
among whose clauses there are measures the telecoms industry has long wanted to see
improved.



Tax issues

The current tax system in place in the European Union is an obstacle to the development of
cross-border content offers. Opportunistic companies distributing content cross-border may
escape European tax obligations. The changes in the European Value Added Tax (VAT) rules
are an important step in the right direction to limit VAT forum shopping for those players
that are not linked by establishment in a specific European Union country, such as some
“Over The Top” internet companies.

Cross-border payments

Reducing the compliancy costs of online cross-border payments is another key target for
regulators.



  II.   Proposal for improvements


Orange believes that transparency in the process of establishing “who owns what rights” is
key. It is essential to both define the scope of the rights and identify the collecting
society(ies) or the rights holders competent to grant a license. In cross-border businesses,
this is even more important. Currently, developing cross-border services requires providers
to repeat costly and time consuming negotiations to clear distribution rights in each
Member State where the service is to be made available. This is clearly unsatisfactory.


In relation to on-line music content, the new Directive on Collective Rights Management
could help to solve some problems such as the lack of transparency, the excessive
transaction costs in the negotiation and implementation of license agreements with
collecting societies, the lack of clarity on rights ownership and the complexity of rights
management. In this respect, national implementations will be key and Orange calls on the
Commission to closely monitor the different national transposition processes.


As regards the introduction of pan-European licenses for audio-visual works covering the
entire European Union’s footprint, Orange questions whether it would be an appropriate
solution. It would not suit the reality of the market and would impose on distributors
clearance of very expensive rights available in 28 Member States with no guarantee of
return on investment in each of them (return from consumers' subscriptions, advertising,
etc.). Pan-European licencing would rather tend to benefit only to large players that are
already established in the market or which have the economic capacity to bear the related
investments. The revision of the European licensing schemes should therefore consider the
current market structure in order not to grant competitive advantages to selected players.


Regarding taxes, Orange considers the current fragmented system as an obstacle to the
efficient and competitive development of the media services industry in the European
Union.

Such a fragmented situation allows either undertakings from outside the European Union or
opportunistic European players to provide services from the most advantageous Member
States regarding taxation, even more because Member States can only levy a tax on a
company turnover if it is established on its territory.

That is why Orange supports the planned evolutions of taxing rules and in particular the
country of consumption of services principle. Implementation of the European principle of
the taxation in the country of consumption in 2017-2018 will be a first positive step to
improve the situation. In addition, implementation of a harmonized European VAT for online
content would not only reduce costs of managing cross-border trade but would also remove
a source of competition distortion. The process should consist in applying a harmonized
reduced VAT rate to the online and physical versions of the same content and to linear and

                                                   5/13
non-linear services. Last of all, corporate taxes are not harmonized in the EU and apply
differently between Member States where companies are established.




6. Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights
for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose
territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the
consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


Creating a single market for content in the European Union by improving the licensing
framework may tend to favour large players that are already established in the market or
those which have the economic capacity to bear the related investments. Maintaining some
territorial restrictions would be beneficial for those actors that need, as a first step, the
removal of non-copyright related barriers in the single market to develop. Orange is in
favour of this second approach.




21        Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
22       Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need
for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
 24      Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?



Ideally, the European single market should be based on consistent and harmonised rules.
The fact that limitations and exceptions vary from one Member State to another does not
encourage nor facilitate pan-European business models and cross-border trade. However,
we acknowledge that, in the field of copyright, Member States have their own specificities
and that it would be very difficult to achieve a mandatory and unique regime of limitations
and exceptions.

Orange believes that a reasonable way out would be to maintain exceptions and limitations
to copyright rules optional for Member States but having a full harmonised regime in case
they decide to implement exceptions and/or limitations in their national legal system.

As an example, in Member States where the private copy regime is applied, this regime
would have to be the same with full harmonisation, especially in relation to the criteria for
the determination of the tariffs, the fair compensation principle, the double compensation,
etc.

26      Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?


The territoriality of limitations and exceptions creates uncertainty for distributors. It is
difficult to have a full knowledge of the applicable regime in place and to understand the
conditions under which content/product can be legitimately distributed in each Member
State a distributor operates or wishes to operate in. The private copy levy regime is one of
the most striking examples of fragmentation: this exception is not provided for by all
Member States (e.g. in the United Kingdom), but also the conditions for its application vary
significantly. Both the requirements triggering its application, the devices it applies to and
the amount of fair compensation differ from one Member State to another.




27     In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed ,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)



The concept of ‘fair compensation’ should be addressed at European level. Orange reminds
that the ‘fair compensation’ is an autonomous concept of European Union law since the
ECJ’s Padawan decision3. This requires a uniform interpretation for Member States having
introduced the private copy exception. A uniform approach is essential to ensure an efficient
functioning of the copyright regime in the age of cloud computing developments (for further
development on the issue, please see Annex 1).




64      In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?


Both the scope and the application of private copying and reprography exceptions need
clarification at European level. This is a fundamental requirement to ensure legal certainty.
Currently, we face diverging national systems targeting different products and applying
different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the
Single Market.
In addition, some Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private
copy levies to transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product is sold (e.g.
private person or business). Orange reminds that the Padawan decision4 has clearly stated
that private copy levy does not cover professional uses. But not all Member States have ex-
ante exemption and/or ex-post reimbursement schemes to remedy these situations and

reduce the number of undue payments. It is therefore important to ensure this is
implemented in a harmonised way in order to avoid competition distortions. It has to be
unambiguously confirmed that compensation for private copying is exclusively targeted to
private copy and must not be extended to professional use.
Compensation should be based on real harm and should therefore not exist if there is no
proven substantial harm to right holders. In addition, private copy levies should be paid
once: double payment in the context of cross-border transactions must be avoided.




65      Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?5


No. In cases where a service has been licensed by right holders and includes a number of
digital copies which generates minimal harm to these right holders, imposing private copy
levies is not justified. Compensation should be based on real harm and should therefore not
exist if there is no proven substantial harm to right holders. Considering that compensation
is needed would run the risk of hindering the digital distribution economy.




66      How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on
different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the
one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?


The extension of the current levy system – which was conceived within the analogue world –
to the online environment needs to be properly assessed, in order not to hamper the
development of innovative technologies and services. The Vitorino report6 presents
arguments against the extension of levies to services based on cloud: attempts to broaden
the interpretation of the private copying exception are not only to the detriment of rights-
holders and legal offers based on license agreements, but are also legally questionable.

The development of innovative technologies and services, in particular on demand services,
allowing users to enjoy digital content over different platforms and devices has led to the
emergence of new business models, in particular around music and audio-visual works.
Consumers want to be able to access digital content from several connected devices, at all
times and from where they want. In that sense, cloud computing responds to their demands.

It allows users to enjoy digital content they recorded without having to store it on a physical
support. European consumers and Internet users would therefore be the first victims of the
imposition of levies on cloud services since prices would most certainly rise because of
levies.
Imposing levies on cloud services would also have a negative impact on European cloud
service providers. The obligation to pay levies added to new administrative burden would
significantly limit their competitiveness on the global market. The negative impact would be
immediate, as levies would raise prices and thus limit the attractiveness, competitiveness
and future development of business models based on new technologies.

Moreover in the digital world, rights-holders already receive compensation for licensed
content including subsequent copies in the framework of licensing contracts. In these cases,
applying the copyright levy system to cloud services would result in an unjustified triple
payment by consumers (i.e. for the licensed content, for the connected device, and for the
cloud service).

If such a system would nonetheless be envisaged, calculating the amount of the
compensation based on the general capacity of a server to store digital content would not
only be contrary to the basic principles of the private copy levy but would also seriously
threaten innovation. Moreover, due to the global nature of cloud services, imposing
territorial/national levy systems on global services would require to overcome the lack of
harmonization of the private copy levy system, in particular for the calculation of the tariffs.
In addition, offers of cloud services have been launched throughout the European Union but
are subject to different regulatory regimes. There is a strong need to ensure that the
regulatory framework applicable to this kind of service is future-proof and fosters
investment in innovation.




67      Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?


Yes. Despite the risk of increasing the ”copyright levies forum shopping”, visibility of the levy
on the invoice of those products that are subject to levies would increase transparency and
awareness among customers.
Orange believes that the burden of providing information should be borne by those who
benefit from the revenues of the levies. In case the European Commission decides that
information should be delivered by distributors, proportionality requires that costs are
borne by right holders. Distributors should not have to pay copyright levies and, in addition,
to bear the financial burden of informing end-users.

71     If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?



Please refer to combined answer to questions 21, 22 and 24.




75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?


Yes. Orange recognizes the importance for right holders to be compensated for their works
and highlights the necessity of enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights. However, Orange
would like to remind the European Commission that it should not be seen as the sole
solution against piracy. A more holistic approach is needed to fix this problem and to ensure
an efficient protection of intellectual property rights. Focusing on how to increase the offer
and the consumption of legal content is key also to ensure the protection of right holders.




76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?


The current system on enforcement such as the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement
Directive (IPRED) has played and continues to play a crucial role in providing right holders
with a high level of intellectual property rights’ protection. These texts are based upon
principles that are still valid today and that should be maintained.
In addition, any future eventual revision must be coherent with the intermediary liability
regime in place today. The current EU legal framework on e-commerce - in particular the
provisions related to intermediaries’ liability - strikes the right balance amongst the interests
of the different stakeholders and this should not be undermined by any eventual review of
the copyright framework.
Moreover, it is also crucial to recognize that counterfeiting and online Intellectual Property
infringements are different in nature, and require different approaches.


The transposition of the IPRED has unfortunately led to big differences amongst Member
States, impacting the efficiency of the enforcement regime. Orange would like to alert the
European Commission on measures which may jeopardize the balance of the entire system.
The IPRED is meant to regulate the procedures in front of the judicial authority and the lack
of IPRED harmonisation does not guarantee the same level of impartiality and control. For
example, several Member States provide for a right of information only in the context of
judicial proceedings while other Member States provide for a right of information even
before formal proceedings as a provisional measure. This goes far beyond the IPRED

provisions and their objective and its application must remain compliant with privacy
regulation.
As a remark, Orange would like to highlight that internet service providers have always
worked in collaboration with judicial authorities to protect copyright in a way that
guarantees citizens’ fundamental rights: presumption of innocence, fair trial, privacy and
confidentiality of communications. However, efficient enforcement depends also on a global
approach where all internet players of the value chain have to cooperate. But as the current
approach is mainly focused on internet service providers working in collaboration with
judicial authorities, it can only have a limited reach.




77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?


Yes. The current civil enforcement framework remains sound and is based on principles that
are still valid today. Implementation measures must be viable for all stakeholders and
proportionate to the gravity of infringement.
Orange shares the views of the European Commission on the necessity to find the correct
balance between fundamental rights and especially between the right of property and the
right to privacy. Both have to coexist. The European Court of Justice has given important and
useful indications in two well-known cases (Promusicae7 and Tele28), asking Member States
and their respective authorities to take measures that, while balancing both rights, should
respect the principle of proportionality. The European Court of Justice decisions imply also
that internet service providers cannot assume the responsibility to balance the rights and
become controllers of the Internet. As a consequence, the enforcement framework
completed by the European Court of Justice ruling achieves a right balance between
copyright and the right to privacy and protection of personal data.
In addition, other fundamental rights should be taken into account. This is the case the
presumption of innocence, fair trial, confidentiality of communications for instance. Since
the SABAM case9, the European Court of Justice has considered the right to conduct a
business as a fundamental right that should be taken into consideration during the balance
process.

        Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


21.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)


Il est indispensable de renforcer l’harmonisation des règles applicables en matière de droit
d’auteur sur l’ensemble du territoire l’Union Européenne au risque de faire émerger et
prospérer des distorsions de concurrence préjudiciables pour le marché intérieur.

Conformément à la Directive 2001/29/CE du Parlement européen et du Conseil du 22 mai
200110 sur l'harmonisation de certains aspects du droit d'auteur et des droits voisins dans la
société de l'information, l’exception pour copie privée doit permettre de maintenir un
niveau élevé de protection de la propriété intellectuelle tout en encourageant « des
investissements importants dans des activités créatrices et novatrices, notamment dans les
infrastructures de réseaux » et favorisant ainsi « la croissance et une compétition accrue de
l'industrie européenne (...) aussi bien dans le secteur de la fourniture de contenus que dans
celui des technologies de l'information » (cons. 4).

En effet les entreprises innovantes contribuent à la vitalité économique nationale et à la
diffusion des technologies et des produits nouveaux sur le marché et dans la société. C'est
pourquoi la loi doit leur assurer un environnement juridique stable et incitatif.

Ainsi il est admis que les règles en matière de droit d’auteur doivent être adaptées pour
tenir compte des réalités économiques sauf à ce que les Etats membres fassent l’impasse sur
les innovations technologiques et économiques. Une posture contraire freinerait
grandement la compétitivité à la fois de notre industrie mais aussi de notre secteur culturel
à l’heure où des acteurs étrangers proposent des services équivalents sans rémunérer les
ayants droit.

De même, cet impératif d’adaptation doit se conjuguer avec celui de l’harmonisation des
règles du droit d’auteur dès lors qu’une disparité dans l’application des normes porte
atteinte au bon fonctionnement du marché intérieur, comme le rappelle le considérant 7 de
la Directive 2001/29/CE :

“Le cadre législatif communautaire relatif à la protection du droit d'auteur et des droits
voisins doit donc aussi être adapté et complété dans la mesure nécessaire au bon
fonctionnement du marché intérieur. Il convient, à cet effet, d'adapter les dispositions
nationales sur le droit d'auteur et les droits voisins qui varient sensiblement d'un État
membre à l'autre ou qui entraînent une insécurité juridique entravant le bon fonctionnement
du marché intérieur et le développement de la société de l'information en Europe et il

technologiques. En revanche, il n'est pas nécessaire de supprimer ou de prévenir les
disparités qui ne portent pas atteinte au fonctionnement du marché intérieur”.

A cet égard, Orange relève qu’une application non homogène du droit d’auteur dans les
différents Etats membres permet à certains prestataires d’exploiter, sur le fondement de
l’exception de copie privée, des services de type « cloud computing » sans pour autant
s’acquitter d’une compensation équitable (rémunération pour copie privée).

Orange constate par exemple que le Luxembourg a introduit dans sa législation nationale 11
l’exception de copie privée mais que néanmoins le mécanisme de compensation équitable
qui en est le corollaire nécessaire n’a pas encore été fixé, de sorte qu’une entreprise établie
au Luxembourg peut tout à fait commercialiser un service fondé juridiquement sur
l’exception de copie privée sans payer de compensation équitable.

En pratique, cela revient à créer une situation d’iniquité voire de réelles distorsions de
concurrence entre un exploitant établi au Luxembourg et un autre établi en France, dès lors
que les services (de cloud computing) des deux concurrents s’adressent aux consommateurs
français.

A titre d’illustration, la société The Digital Nation, établie au Luxembourg, commercialise un
service de type cloud computing dénommé « Streamnation »12 destiné aux consommateurs
français. De par son établissement social, cette société bénéficie d’un avantage
concurrentiel par rapport aux sociétés françaises, avantage qui repose sur un transposition
différente (parce qu’incomplète au Luxembourg) entre les Etats membres de la Directive
2001/29/CE.

Dans ces conditions, Orange invite la Commission à renforcer le processus d’harmonisation
des règles applicables en matière de rémunération pour copie privée, d’autant plus que la
compensation équitable est désormais une « notion autonome » en droit de l’Union
européenne13.
