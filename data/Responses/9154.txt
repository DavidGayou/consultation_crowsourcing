 Response from The European Blind Union (EBU) to the Public Consultation on
                    the review of the EU copyright rules




1. About us


The European Blind Union (EBU) is  a  non-governmental,  non  profit  making
European organisation founded in 1984. It is one of the six regional  bodies
of the World Blind Union, and it promotes the interests of blind people  and
people with low vision in Europe. It currently operates within a network  of
44 national members including  organisations  from  all  28  European  Union
member states, candidate nations and other major countries  in  geographical
Europe.

We are happy for our contribution to be made public.


TYPE OF RESPONDENT

For  the  purposes  of  this  consultation,  we  are  a  representative   of
consumers.

We have only answered those questions which we deem to be  of  relevance  to
the interests of blind and partially sighted people.

21. Are there problems arising from  the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright  directives  are  optional  for  the
Member States?

YES

In terms of the disability exception in 5.3.b,  EBU  notes  that  it  is  an
optional, rather than obligatory, exception. In practice, to our  knowledge,
all Member  States  have  implemented  an  exception  for  disabled  people.
However, the non-mandatory nature of the exception leaves open the  worrying
possibility that any  Member  State  could  legally  remove  its  disability
exception if it chose to do so.

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be  made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

YES

Given the importance as a public policy  objective  of  ensuring  access  to
copyright works for disabled people through exceptions,  EBU  believes  that
were the Directive to be amended, the exception  in  5.3.b  should  be  made
mandatory.

We understand that it is not easy to make  all  exceptions  and  limitations
mandatory, as they have a different nature and their  respective  objectives
are too heterogeneous, but making this  exception  in  particular  mandatory
would align the EU  and  its  Member  States  with  the  objectives  of  the
“Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works  for  Persons  Who
Are Blind, Visually  Impaired,  or  Otherwise  Print  Disabled”  (henceforth
referred to here as the “Marrakech Treaty”) and  indeed  those  set  out  in
Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons  with  Disabilities,
ratified by the EU on 23rd December 2010.

We consider that the rights and the effective inclusion of blind people  and
people with visual disabilities in European society  cannot  be  subject  to
arbitrary decisions on whether an exception is adopted or not,  and  on  how
that exception is  transposed  in  national  legislation.  An  exception  on
access to information cannot be given  the  same  treatment  as  quotations,
political speeches or the selling of works of Art.

Basic levels of harmonisation and mandatory standards must  be  achieved  in
the case of exceptions such as the one we are referring to, with the aim  of
preventing a situation whereby a person with a visual disability  may  enjoy
different rights in different countries of the EU.




26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in   your
experience, constitute a problem?

YES

This is the case, because it  prevents  the  sending  of  accessible  format
works made under national copyright exceptions  (implemented  in  line  with
5.3.b  of  the  Copyright  Directive)  across  EU  Member   State   borders,
especially between countries sharing the same language.

At the moment, blind and partially  sighted  people  are  living  through  a
“book famine” in which a very  small  percentage  of  books  are  ever  made
accessible in formats such as audio, large print or  braille.  Most  of  the
work to produce and supply accessible format books is done by  organisations
of blind people, or other specialist  organisations,  often  charities.   To
maximise scant resources, these  organisations  need  to  be  able  to  send
accessible  books  or  digital  files  of  these   books   to   other   such
organisations in other countries, especially in cases  where  two  countries
share the same language. Doing so would avoid costly duplication  and  allow
these organisations to make more accessible titles available to  the  people
they serve.

However, such a transfer has largely not  been  possible  due  to  questions
over the legality of doing so, even when such a transfer  would  be  between
two EU Member States.

The book famine contrasts starkly with the position of  non-disabled  people
in the EU. While people without disabilities can access to works written  in
any of the EU languages through the commercial means better suited to  their
needs, blind people and people with visual disabilities see their access  to
works produced in other languages unfairly restricted.

A speedy and effective ratification of the Marrakech Treaty, outside of  any
possible revision of the Directive, ought to solve this problem  of  sending
books across borders, and this would be our preferred solution.


50.   (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
organisation representing persons with disabilities:] Have  you  experienced
problems with accessibility to content, including  across  borders,  arising
from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?
 
YES

A and b: As mentioned above, the problem we experience is that it  is  still
illegal or legally questionable, even within  the  EU,  to  send  accessible
format books transcribed using national  copyright  exceptions  to  disabled
people or their organisations across international  borders-  whether  those
borders be within the EU or outside the EU.

The  exception  in  5.3.b  does  not  cover  the  cross-border  sending   of
accessible books.

To that end, to send accessible books from one country to another,  we  have
to  fall  back  on  licenses  from  rights  holders,  which  are  often  not
forthcoming, can be costly,  and  take  time  to  obtain,  or  else  decline
requests we receive from  print  disabled  people  in  other  countries  for
accessible books from our collection.


51.   If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

[Open question]

We need the Commission and all EU Member States to move quickly to sign  and
ratify the Marrakech Treaty,  which  will  thus  remove  the  legal  barrier
mentioned above, and provide a clear legal  framework  under  which  we  can
quickly and effectively send accessible books from one country  to  another,
whether inside or outside the  EU.  To  avoid  unnecessary  and  significant
delay, ratification should be achieved outside of  the  (possible)  revision
of Directive 2001/29/EC.

Another legal concern EBU has relates to 6.4 paragraph 4  of  the  Directive
2001/29/EC. In short, the Directive  currently  states  that  Member  States
shall "take appropriate measures" to ensure that Technological Measures  (in
layman's terms a sort of "digital padlock") do not to  prevent  the  use  of
the disability exception provided in Article 5.3.b of  the  Directive.  This
is helpful in asserting  the  important  fact  that  Technological  Measures
should not block legitimate enjoyment of the disability exception.

However, paragraph 4 of 6.4 says that this  requirement  that  technological
measures do not render exceptions ineffective does not apply to  the  "right
of making available". (It states: "The provisions of the  first  and  second
subparagraphs  shall  not  apply  to  works  or  other  subject-matter  made
available to the public on agreed contractual  terms  in  such  a  way  that
members of  the  public  may  access  them  from  a  place  and  at  a  time
individually chosen by them.")

We are concerned that this  "making  available"  exemption  might  have  the
effect that works such as books which are streamed / or ebooks for  download
would not  be  covered  by  the  "Technological  Measures  should  not  stop
legitimate use of an exception" concept in 6.4 of the Directive.

As we understand it, paragraph 6.4.4  could  be  interpreted  to  mean  that
access to some sorts of "on-demand"  work  by  a  visually  impaired  person
under the exception could be breaking the  law  if  they  have  to  break  a
Technological Measure to make such a work accessible.  We  note  that  there
are different views as to what services 6.4.4 covers, but  feel  that  as  a
matter of principle and practicality, the Directive should  not  hamper  the
legitimate  use  of  the  disability  exception  by  allowing  Technological
Measures to block that use in some cases.

Were the Directive to be reopened, EBU would urge  the  Commission  to  look
again at this matter, with a view  to  ensuring  that  a  revised  Directive
would more clearly  allow  print  disabled  people  full  enjoyment  of  the
Directive's exceptions.  We  feel  confident  that  the  caveats  about  the
disability exception being only for disabled people,  and  only  on  a  non-
commercial basis, would still constitute sufficient  protection  for  rights
holders, even if this protection for Technological  Measures  for  on-demand
works were removed.

52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate  accessibility
to content? How successful are they?

Ultimately, EBU wants the "book  famine"  faced  by  visually  impaired  and
other print disabled people, solved in the "mainstream"  by  publishers.  We
want to be able to get accessible format books in the same way  as  everyone
else -by buying them at the same time and price as non-disabled people,  and
by obtaining  them  from  a  library.  Our  members  are  involved  in  many
initiatives with  publishers  and  other  organisations  in  the  publishing
chain, too numerous to mention here, with the aim of  making  this  dream  a
reality.

Accessibility  improvements  have  already  been  made  by  the  publishing/
software industry. We welcome these and urge more of them. But  there  is  a
very long way to go. Too often, the technical tools that could  be  used  to
make mainstream books accessible are still not known or used. An  effective,
modern and appropriate legal framework should be in place now to  complement
these efforts and to ensure that where mainstream provision /  "the  market"
fails, as it still, most often,  does,   organisations  providing  books  to
blind people can legally make good as much as possible of the shortfall.

The Publishing World considers books  in  accessible  audio  formats  or  in
Braille format as products that do not fit into  their  catalogue,  as  they
are specifically for  people  with  disabilities.  It  also  estimates  that
adding  accessibility  guidelines  to  their  e-books  can  slow  down   the
production process and add (unnecessary) extra costs.  Without  doubt,  this
type of books  requires  the  least  degree  of  effort  when  incorporating
accessibility guidelines to their  production  process,  particularly  after
the new EPUB standard, and e-books would be the  type  of  publication  most
likely to become the so long-awaited “book for all” and combat the  profound
“book famine” that people with disabilities are suffering when  accessing  a
printed text.

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal  framework
for copyright? Please explain  and  indicate  how  such  matters  should  be
addressed.


EBU would like to underline our view that  the  EU  should  proceed  rapidly
with both the ratification and implementation of the Marrakech Treaty.

It should be remembered that it is the first treaty aiming to directly  meet
some of the objectives of the UN Convention on the Rights  of  Persons  with
Disabilities.

We urge the  EU  to  set  a  strong  precedent  by  speedily  ratifying  and
implanting the MarrakechTreaty, so as to allow this  new  law  to  make  its
vital contribution to access to information,  social  inclusion,  employment
and culture for print disabled people.

It is essential that the review of the current Directive on  Copyright  that
the Commission has decided to  embark  on,  does  not  either  prejudice  or
interfere with the Rights of people  with  disabilities,  allowing  for  its
parallel implementation and whatever is necessary so  that  the  EU,  as  an
entity with its own legal status, ratifies the Marrakech Treaty,  in  strict
compliance with what is established by the UN Convention on  the  Rights  of
Persons with Disabilities.
