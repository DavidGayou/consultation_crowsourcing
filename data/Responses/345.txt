         I.Introduction

A.Context of the consultation

Over the last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created, distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content - for
information,  education  or  entertainment   purposes   -   regardless   of
geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy
and promote cultural diversity.

In its "Communication  on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"1  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in  2014  on  whether  to
table legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4.  The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact that  two  groups  -
user-generated content and text and data mining - did not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of the  legislative
framework.

As part of the review process, the Commission is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication on  Content  in  the
Digital Single Market,

http://ec,europa,eu/internal_market/copvright/docs/licences-ror-
europe/l3lll3_ten-pledges_en,pdr
i.e.: "territoriality in the Internal  Market,  harmonisation,  limitations
and exceptions to copyright in the digital age;  fragmentation  of  the  EU
copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness  and  efficiency  of
enforcement while underpinning its  legitimacy  in  the  wider  context  of
copyright reform". As highlighted in  the  October  2013  European  Council
Conclusions[1] "Providing digital services and content  across  the  single
market requires the establishment of a copyright  regime  for  the  digital
age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review of  the  EU
copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to  modernise  Europe's
copyright regime and facilitate licensing,  while  ensuring  a  high  level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural
diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings,  in
particular those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[2], the "Green Paper on the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[3] and "Content Online"[4]. These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible  ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to  the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders' remuneration, particularly in the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,  distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way to
proceed. The "Green Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed  into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

B.How to submit replies to this questionnaire

You are kindly asked to send your replies by 5 February 2014 in a MS  Word,
PDF or OpenDocument format to the following e-mail address of  DG  Internal
Market and Services: markt-copyright-consultation@ec.europa.eu. Please note
that replies sent after that date will not be taken into account.

This consultation is addressed to different categories of stakeholders.  To
the extent possible, the questions indicate the category/ies of respondents
most likely to be concerned by them (annotation  in  brackets,  before  the
actual question). Respondents should nevertheless feel  free  to  reply  to
any/all of the questions. Also, please note that, apart from  the  question
concerning the identification of the respondent, none of the  questions  is
obligatory. Replies containing answers only to part of the  questions  will
be also accepted.

You are requested to provide your answers directly within this consultation
document. For the "Yes/No/No opinion" questions  please  put  the  selected
answer in bold and underline it so it is easy for us to see your selection.

In your answers to the questions, you are invited to refer to the situation
in EU Member States. You are also invited in particular to indicate,  where
relevant,


what would be the impact of options you put  forward  in  terms  of  costs,
opportunities and revenues.

The public consultation is available in English. Responses may, however, be
sent in any of the 24 official languages of the EU.

C. Confidentiality

The contributions received in this round  of  consultation  as  well  as  a
summary report presenting the responses in  a  statistical  and  aggregated
form will be published on the website of DG MARKT.

Please note that all contributions received will be published together with
the identity of the contributor, unless  the  contributor  objects  to  the
publication of their personal data on the  grounds  that  such  publication
would harm his or her legitimate interests. In this case, the  contribution
will be  published  in  anonymous  form  upon  the  contributor's  explicit
request. Otherwise the contribution will not  be  published  nor  will  its
content be reflected in the summary report.

         I.Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere
in Europe?

D.[The territorial scope of the rights involved  in  digital  transmissions
and the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]

Holders of copyright and related rights - e.g. writers, singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead, they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is  limited  to
the territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law9.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet - e.g.  by
a music streaming service, or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  -  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a  position  to  grant  a  multi-territorial  or  pan-  European
licence, such that content services  can  be  provided  in  several  Member
States and across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to
facilitate multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on
Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery
of multi-territorial licences in musical works for online  services11;  the
structured stakeholder dialogue  "Licences  for  Europe"12  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition13.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them  when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives
of the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the further  development  of  cross-
border portability14.

htt.p://ec.eiiropa.eii/mt.emal_market/copyright/docs/licences-fbr-
eiirope/131113j;en-pledges_en.pdf


Despite progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to, services. These problems are most  obvious  to
consumers wanting to access services that  are  made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all online  services  are
available in all Member States and consumers face problems when  trying  to
access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the  "same"
service is available in all Member  States,  consumers  cannot  access  the
service across borders (they can only access their "national" service,  and
if they try to access the "same" service in another Member State  they  are
redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

This situation may in part stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing  of   rights   in   different
territories. Contractual clauses  in  licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[5]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.

    1. [In particular if you are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
       problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member  State
       other than the one in which you live?

 L YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and
 the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as  certain  films
 and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,  magazines,
 journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)

 As a end user I did face  problems  in  my  access  to  contents  from  one
 European country to another., i.e. problems with video and music streaming,
 problems with apps, and problems with ebooks., etc.

 As a creator and contents producer, I also faced these issues as they  made
 my own work unavailable  outside  France  (e-books),  either  depending  on
 countries, os systems, marketing or national policies.

 Then, as a whole, I consider the copyright issue from two points  of  view:
 there should be a border-free, universal access, not related to  commercial
 policies and censorship policies. There also should be a  full  portability
 between systems and software. Please note that  I  can  only  refer  to  my
 experience as a writer creating e-books. However, hypertext e-books  are  a
 forthcoming technology so I consider them a good example.

 A YES - Please explain whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
 related to copyright or to other issues (e.g. business  decisions  relating
 to the cost of providing services across  borders,  compliance  with  other
 laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples  indicating  the
 Member State, the sector and the type of content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
 content such as certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
 general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and  newspapers,   games,

    3. [In particular if you are a right holder or a  collective  management
       organisation:] How often are you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
       licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number  of  requests  per
       year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and
       the type of content concerned.

 [Open question]

    4. If you have  identified  problems  in  the  answers  to  any  of  the
       questions above - what would be the best way to tackle them?

 [Open question]

 The solution would be to guarantee  the  access  to  any  digital  contents
 without  consideration  of  the  borders.  The  current  trend  towards  an
 applicative model (as opposed to open formats)linked to propriatory systems
 and platforms which have no incitation to respect an open  Internet  should
 be tackle with mandatory interoperability and the refuse of DRM.

 For cultural products, DRM are a refrain  to  creativity  and  they  should
 never be used as an argument in favor of the creators. They just serve  the
 markting business models but  not  the  authors.  It  is  a  kind  of  very
 unimaginative marketing.


   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?

   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the

      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?
A YES - Please explain by giving examples A NO
A NO OPINION

   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?

A YES - Please explain

We should suppress all territorial restrictions, as they make no  sense  in
the digital age.  Furthermore  they  give  to  much  power  to  third-party
operators such as contents platforms. As most of these platforms which  try
to impose their model are not E.U produced, and as most of these  platforms
don't even contribute to the E.U. Economy  (for  example  because  of  taxe
evasion) it's a non-sense to accept their limitative, territorially defined
copyright. It is counterproductive and it hands too much power  over  third
parties.

A NO - Please explain
   E./s there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs  to
   be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

ι. [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
   The EU framework for the protection of copyright and  related  rights  in
   the digital environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC[6]
   on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and  related  rights
   in the information society. Other EU directives in this  field  that  are
   relevant in the online environment are those relating to  the  protection
   of software[7] and databases[8].

   Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of  authors  and  neighbouring
   rightholders[9] which are  essential  for  the  transmission  of  digital
   copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g.
   a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.

   The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are  the  reproduction
   right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the making of  copies[10],
   (notably relevant at the start of the transmission - e.g.  the  uploading
   of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available  -
   and at the users' end - e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a
   work) and the communication to the public/making  available  right,  i.e.
   the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination  of  the  works  in
   digital networks[11]. These rights are intrinsically  linked  in  digital
   transmissions and both need to be cleared.

2. The act of "making available"

   Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what  is  covered  by  the  making
   available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by  the  public,  the
   actual reception by the public) nor where the act of  "making  available"
   takes place. This does not raise questions if the act  is  limited  to  a
   single territory. Questions arise however when  the  transmission  covers
   several territories and rights need  to  be  cleared  (does  the  act  of
   "making available" happen in the country of the upload only? in  each  of
   the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
   countries where the content is effectively accessed?).  The  most  recent
   case law of the Court of Justice of the


 European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the "targeting"
 of a certain Member State's public[12].  According  to  this  approach  the
 copyright-relevant act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in  those
 countries which are "targeted" by the online service  provider.  A  service
 provider "targets" a group of customers residing in a specific country when
 it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,
 a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.

    8. Is  the  scope  of  the  "making  available"  right  in  cross-border
      situations - i.e. when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  -
      sufficiently clear?

 L YES

 L NO - Please explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
 clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach  explained
 above, as in "country of origin" approach[13])
      I suggest your whole questionnaire should be clarified. My only
 consideration as a contents producer is that my work  should  be  available
 from any country.

 Targeting, on the Internet network, should not be accepted as it is  linked
 to marketing and commercial practices which could  led  to  discriminations
 and unfair shemes. Targeting is also very correlated to monitoring IP and
 navigation, and could nourrish privacy concerns
 It's a different matter than pointing a satellite on a geographical area,
 since it includes a cartography of the infrastructure which includes
 personal data such as IP or browsing habit. Targeting, on the web, is a
 very invasive tool with many potential abuses.

 L NO OPINION

    9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a  clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[14])?

 L YES - Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


   What is important is the recognition of the work - i.e. attribution. I'm
   certainly not interested in ant  "enforcement"  of  my  rights  if  they
   include  surveillance  tools  of  downloads,  or  any  other   kind   of
   restrictive technology such as DRM. All these surveillance tools  are  a
   drawback to creativity.

   A NO OPINION

3. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

   Each act of transmission in digital networks  entails  (in  the  current
   state of technology and law)  several  reproductions.  This  means  that
   there  are  two  rights  that  apply  to  digital   transmissions:   the
   reproduction right and the making available right. This  may  complicate
   the licensing of works for online use notably when the  two  rights  are
   held by different persons/entities.

       10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does
         the application  of  two  rights  to  a  single  act  of  economic
         exploitation in the online environment (e.g.  a  download)  create
         problems for you?

   A YES - Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
   address such problems (e.g. facilitation  of  joint  licences  when  the
   rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the  "bundling  of
   rights")

   A NO

   A NO OPINION

4. Linking and browsing

   Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in
   the Internet to another. They are indispensable for the functioning of
   the Internet as a network. Several cases are pending before the CJEU25
   in which the question has been raised whether the provision of a
   clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making
   available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
   A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates
   temporary copies of  works  and  other  subject-matter  protected  under
   copyright on the screen and in the 'cache' memory  of  his  computer.  A
   question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such  copies  are
   always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception  for  temporary  acts  of
   reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

       11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a  work  or  other
         subject matter protected under copyright,  either  in  general  or
         under specific circumstances, be subject to the  authorisation  of
         the rightholder?

                                                 PressSummary.pdf.
    A YES - Please explain whether you consider  this  to  be  the  case  in
    general, or under specific circumstances, and why

    A NO - Please explain whether you  consider  this  to  be  the  case  in
    general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does
    not amount to an act of communication to  the  public  -  or  to  a  new
    public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

    Hypertext or hyperlinks are the basics of the  Internet  technology  and
    should never be subject to authorization

    A NO OPINION

       12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
         reproduction of a work or other  subject  matter  protected  under
         copyright on the screen and in the  cache  memory  of  the  user's
         computer, either in general or under  specific  circumstances,  be
         subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

    A YES - Please explain whether you consider  this  to  be  the  case  in
    general, or under specific circumstances, and why

    A NO - Please explain whether you  consider  this  to  be  the  case  in
    general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or
    should be covered by a copyright exception)

    That's a non-sense, technically speaking. The cache is not any  kind  of
    physical storage but only  some  convenience  which  is  band-width  and
    energy savvy; Copyrighting the cache could only lead to legal confusion,
    it's not user-friendly. Also, it could  have  side  effects  on  further
    developments to navigators and apps.  If  the  cache  memory  implies  a
    copyright, this could lead to more control over the final user and  more
    filtering.

    A NO OPINION

5. Download to own digital content

   Digital content is increasingly being  bought  via  digital  transmission
   (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the possibility  for  users
   to dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling them  or
   by giving them as  a  gift).  The  principle  of  EU  exhaustion  of  the
   distribution right applies in the case of the  distribution  of  physical
   copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD  or  a  book,  etc.  is
   sold, the right
                                                                          14

 holder  cannot  prevent  the  further   distribution   of   that   tangible
 article)[15]. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also
 be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in  its  effect
 to distribution  (i.e.  where  the  buyer  acquires  the  property  of  the
 copy)[16].  This  raises  difficult  questions,  notably  relating  to  the
 practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers  keeping
 and using a copy of a work after they have "re-sold" it  -  this  is  often
 referred to as the "forward  and  delete"  question)  as  well  as  to  the
 economic implications of the creation of a secondhand market of  copies  of
 perfect quality that never deteriorate  (in  contrast  to  the  second-hand
 market for physical goods).

    13. [In particular if you are an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

 L YES - Please explain by giving examples

 Reselling ? I did not even know I could resell. But sometimes  I  resell  a
 computer "as is" and I never erase the software. This is  the  only  way  I
 resell digital goods.

 If I buy a software and I install it on a computer, if my  computer  breaks
 down I cannot reinstall the software  I've  bought  (either  physically  or
 online), but it is sold with a fixed number of licences. This is not always
 the case, but very often the access code given by the firm which sells  the
 computer only works once or twice - whatever they pretend to sell.

 So, if I buy a dictionnary, and  then  I  try  to  install  it  on  several
 computers, because I'm a writer and over the course of  years  I  may  use,
 let's say, four different computers, at some point I cannot  reinstall  the
 dictionnary because I overpassed the limit of 2 or 3. And then, if I buy  a
 new licence I just discover it hasn't been updated for years, so I  had  to
 pay twice for the same product, and for my same, lonely, non-commercial use
 of it.

 These practices have led to commercial approaches such like "software as  a
 service", which is  even  worst.  The  multiple  vulnerabilities  of  cloud
 services, and the numerous legal and technical drawbacks of such an approch
 should lead to discourage these tools, which are commercially developped to
 evase the exhaustion of rights.


    14. [In particular if you are a right holder  or  a  service  provider:]
       What would  be  the  consequences  of  providing  a  legal  framework
       enabling the resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please
       specify per market (type of content) concerned.

 [Open question]

F.Registration of works and other subject matter - is it a good idea?

Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights. However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[17]. Moreover a system of registration does not need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and  with   the   increased
opportunities that digital technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration
are increasingly being considered[18].

   15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
       identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?

|A YES          |                                                      |
|A NO           |                                                      |
|A NO OPINION...|.../ NOT SURE                                         |


16. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


 It is not necessarily a mode which would result in simplification. It would
 be better if it was done on a voluntary basis.

    17. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
      The registration should be offered by default under a Creative
licence model.

G.How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers.

There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held  by
producers, collective management organisations, and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,  internationally   agreed   'identifiers'.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[19], and identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers and  databases.
The Global Repertoire Database[20]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of musical  works
worldwide. The Linked Content  Coalition[21]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a Rights
Reference Model (RRM) - a comprehensive data model for all types of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[22] is seeking to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.

    18.What should be the role of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption  of
      identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting  the  development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

[Open question]

it's more a matter of attribution than a matter of copyright. Most  of  the
tools you provide here only call for control, like a European DMCA

H.Term of protection - is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with  the
applicable national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[23]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the  death  of  the
author. The eU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).


With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

    19.Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in
       the digital environment?

 L YES - Please explain

 L NO - Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

 No, they should be shorter, like 30 years. As a writer,  when  I'm  dead  I
 just want my work to be freely accessed after my death, no heir holders.

 Also, the digital age calls for the exhaustion of rights:  once  a  product
 have been paid for, the user should be able to share it.

 L NO OPINION

         I.Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable  the  use
of  works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC[24].

Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[25].   In   accordance   with   international
obligations, the EU acquis requires that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised  at
EU level)[26], these limitations and exceptions are often optional[27],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting  that
not all of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright

are of equivalent significance in  policy  terms  and  in  terms  of  their
potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market.

In addition, in the same manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[28]

The cross-border effect of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders. In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are  used
for illustration in an online course given by an  university  in  a  Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of  that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member  States'  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain  uses   the
authorisation of rightholders is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,  and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

    21.Are there problems arising from the fact that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are  optional  for
      the Member States?

 A YES - Please explain by referring to specific cases

 It is very  unclear  to  understand  the  different  exceptions  and  their
 reasons, but the research and edutional exceptions  should  be  guaranteed.
 Considering orphan works, the current rules and practice in my own  country
 (France) has proven to be counterproductive for both end users and contents
 creators. Many works from little-known artists have already  fall  or  will
 fall soon under this orphan act, and it's a worry.

 A totally different way has been chosen by Norway, which  recently  decided
 all its literature before 2001  would  be  put  online  under  an  Extended
 Collective licence. Though Norway is not part of the EU, maybe the European
 Commission could be interested in studying this.

 A NO - Please explain
    22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if  so,  is
       there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

 A YES - Please explain by referring to specific cases

      Exceptions should be discussed on a step-by-step basis with a higher
 level of information for citizens. Then maybe it would become  possible  to
 say if they have to be made mandatory, with common interest in mind.

 A NO - Please explain

 A NO OPINION

    23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be  added  to  or  removed
       from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to  specific
       cases.

 [Open question]

|  |24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to     |

|  |25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for         |
|  |flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ,  |
|  |periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the       |
|  |Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or|

 This is an example of a debate over fair  use  which  is  interesting.  The
 dispute was terminated with a recognition of the blogger's right to parody:
 http://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=charlie+brown

Other exceptions are important for school and research means, for example
when they allow text and data mining and remote access to digital content
(e-lending) by libraries, as well as a right of educational reprography and
a right to access (browse) the ressources. This right should be effective
from any European country to any European contents (by European, we could
define that a "European" resource is provided by a European institution
such as libraries and museums. The data may be stored elsewhere. On this
matter, another debate is needed.

    26. Does the territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

 A YES - Please explain why and specify which exceptions you  are  referring
 to

 IF I am never sure I will be able to practice the  Internet  the  same  way
 from one country to another, it puts at risk on unknown infrigements

 A NO - Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to

 A NO OPINION

    27./n the event that limitations and exceptions established at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how should  the  question  of
      "fair compensation" be addressed, when such compensation is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 Basically on the financial side I consider  the  input  should  be  put  on
 making sure the third-party providers act in good faith and pay  the  taxes
 related to their work in the E.U. No end-user or creator should have to pay
 for that. And there is not even a need for new laws. A part  of  the  taxes
 already  owed  by  contents  aggregators,  search  machines  and   software
 companies would largely pay for that.

Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law
a range of limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly
accessible libraries,


      educational establishments  and  museums,  as  well  as  archives.  If
      implemented,  these  exceptions  allow  acts   of   preservation   and
      archiving[29] and enable on-site consultation of the works  and  other
      subject matter in the collections of such institutions[30]. The public
      lending (under an exception or limitation) by these establishments  of
      physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed  by  the
      Rental and Lending Directive[31].

      Questions arise as to  whether  the  current  framework  continues  to
      achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to  be  clarified
      or updated to cover  use  in  digital  networks.  At  the  same  time,
      questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion  on  the
      normal exploitation of works and other subject matter and  as  to  the
      prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role  of  licensing  and
      possible framework  agreements  between  different  stakeholders  also
      needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving

      The preservation of the copies of works or other  subject-matter  held
      in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or
      films) - the restoration or  replacement  of  works,  the  copying  of
      fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of  these
      works or other subject matter.  Most  Member  States  provide  for  an
      exception in their national laws  allowing  for  the  making  of  such
      preservation copies. The scope of the exception  differs  from  Member
      State  to  Member  State  (as  regards   the   type   of   beneficiary
      establishments, the  types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by  the
      exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions that  a
      beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
      new types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving
      publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

         28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you
            experienced specific problems when trying to use an exception to
            preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in
            your collection?

      (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have  you  experienced
      problems with  the  use  by  libraries,  educational  establishments,
      museum or archives of the preservation exception?
      A YES - Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use
      in question. A NO
      A NO OPINION - even if I know that part of my digital work is crawled
      / harvested and indexed, I have no  idea  what  the  National  French
      library does or will do with. I'm OK with the crawling as far  as  it
      records writings for the public interest, education and research.

would they best be solved?

   The use of crawled data could be  accompanied  by  a  statement  clearly
   explaining its goals, timelapses and public. It should take  attribution
   into account.

      30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would
         be  its  main  elements?  Which  activities  of  the   beneficiary
         institutions should be covered and under which conditions?

   The main question is to have more transparency about te use of the  data
   collected. There could be limitations like a clear and easy  possibility
   to opt out, to receve a copy of what have been harvested, or to have the
   data being suppressed.

      31.If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it
         be?

   The main solution is to create  a  icence  for  that,  which  should  be
   inspired by the Creative Commons Licence.

1. Off-premises access to library collections
   Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works
   and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a  documentary)
   via dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments  for  the
   purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of  works
   and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not  on
   the premises of the library) requires  authorisation  and  is  generally
   addressed in agreements between universities/libraries  and  publishers.
   Some argue that the law rather than agreements should  provide  for  the
   possibility to, and  the  conditions  for,  granting  online  access  to
   collections.

      32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional  user:]  Have  you
         experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate  agreements
         with rights holders that enable  you  to  provide  remote  access,
         including across borders, to your collections (or  parts  thereof)
         for purposes of research and private study?

b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
   specific problems when trying  to  consult,  including  across  borders,
   works and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions
   such as universities and national libraries when  you  are  not  on  the
   premises of the institutions in question?

   Yes. Even if it gives nice reasons to travel abroad,  it's  a  bit  old-
   fashioned.

c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
   agreements with institutional users that enable  those  institutions  to
   provide remote access, including across borders, to the works  or  other
   subject-matter in  their  collections,  for  purposes  of  research  and
   private study?

   I have never been asked for such an agreement but I would grant it Not
   sure my publisher would agree, which is too bad.


  34. /f your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?
A better legislation could guarantee a strong defence  of  educational  and
research open access.
Basically it  has  largely  been  discussed  that  scientific  reviews  and
databases are billing a lot of money for access to articles but they little
pay off the writer or reasearcher. These practices should be discouraged.
Also, the Aaron Swartz case, though American (Aaron Swartz was convicted to
have hacked the Jstor Database and committed suicide), should  be  kept  in
mind. Giving access to research tools and papers should not be  treated  as
an infrigement / felony.
  35. /f   your view is that a different solution is needed, what would  it
      be?

E - lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and  libraries   are
currently experimenting with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

    36. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or
      other materials held in your collection?
      37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
    Platforms have to comply with interoperability  ;  for  example  if  an
   ebook only was created as an application or any proproprietary format, it
   should be accessible with an alternative like ODT,  PDF,  etc.,  so  that
   more people have access to it.

   The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and
   the previous one (n° 2).

|  |38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What         |
|  |differences do you see in the management of physical and online    |
|  |collections, including providing access to your subscribers? What  |
|  |problems have you encountered?                                     |
|                                                                      |
|  |39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do  |
|  |you see between libraries' traditional activities such as          |
|  |on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such as  |
|  |off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending?   |
|  |What problems have you encountered?                                |


I don't see problems on the matter.


3. Mass digitisation
   The term "mass digitisation" is normally used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
   institutions such as libraries and archives to digitise (e.g.  scan)  the
   entire content or part of their collections with an objective to preserve
   these collections and, normally, to make them available  to  the  public.
   Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early  part
   of the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.
   This matter has been partly  addressed  at  the  EU  level  by  the  2011
   Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on  the  digitisation
   and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works  which  are  no
   longer found in the normal channels of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to
   facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals)  on
   the basis of licence agreements between libraries  and  similar  cultural
   institutions on the one hand and the  collecting  societies  representing
   authors and publishers on the other[32]. Provided the required funding is
   ensured (digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of
   this MoU should be that books that are currently to be found only in  the
   archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available
   online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary  licences  (granted  by
   Collective Management Organisations on the basis  of  the  mandates  they
   receive from authors and publishers). Some  Member  States  may  need  to
   enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such  licences
   (e.g. by establishing


in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting  society  or
the recognition of an "extended effect" to the licences granted)[33].

    40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the  2011  MoU  (i.e.
      the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting  societies)
      have a crossborder effect so  that  out  of  commerce  works  can  be
      accessed across the EU?

    41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
      agreed for other types of content (e.g. for  audio-  or  audio-visual
      collections, broadcasters' archives)?

 L YES - Please explain

      Not sure which mechanisms would be best, but they are needed.

 L NO - Please explain L NO OPINION

I.Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC[34]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  purpose   of
illustration for noncommercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation  at
Member States level. The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing  instead
a framework for the


licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law
should provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at
home.

J.Research
Directive 2001/29/EC[35] enables Member States to choose whether to
implement in their national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-
commercial scientific research. The open formulation of this (optional)
provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States
level.

 students should be given specific accesses to these databases.

    49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of
      content for research purposes? How successful are they?

 K.Disabilities
 Directive 2001/29/EC[36]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
 benefit  of  people  with  a  disability.  The  open  formulation  of  this
 (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at  Member
 States level. At Eu and international level projects have been launched  to
 increase the accessibility of works and other subject- matter  for  persons
 with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works  published  in
 special formats and facilitating their  distribution  across  the  European
 Union) [37]


The Marrakesh Treaty[38] has been adopted to facilitate access to published
works for persons who are blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows
organisations for the blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired  persons   without   the
authorisation of the rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

    50. (a) [In particular if you are a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
       organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]  Have   you
       experienced problems with accessibility to content, including  across

       exception?

L.Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[39] are different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites,
databases etc.). Through the use of software or other automated  processes,
an analysis is made of relevant texts and  data  in  order  to  obtain  new
insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to  e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is made
of the relevant texts and data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or
other subject matter, it is necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whether the main problems arising in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain  "access"  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific  content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe"[40]. In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered that a  specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis  of  a
distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

    57.Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute
       barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

Some technical barriers can make the harvesting  of  data  very  difficult.
Maybe these barriers should be controlled and suppressed.

M.User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and
distribute content at little to no financial cost. As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the making  of
so-called "user-generated content". While users can create totally original
content, they can also take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[41]. User-generated content (UGC) can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not "new" as such. However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and
increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing  works.  Re-use  is  no
longer the preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With the
possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to all, at no
cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to fundamental rights  such
the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and  the
users generating the content. In any event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
usergenerated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
"Licences for Europe" discussions[42].

[Open question]

         I.Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[43]. Levies are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a  view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making
copies for their private use) or through use  of  certain  technique  (i.e.
reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the  question  arises
as to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers' licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies
to certain types of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

   21. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level  the  scope
      and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions[44]
      in the digital environment?

 A YES - Please explain

 Souble payment already happens very often  if  you  try  to  stick  to  the
 current legal framework. This should be avoided. However  it  is  not  only
 linked to the diversity of the European markets and regulations, but a side-
 effect of DRMization.

       copying levies?[45]

Diverging national systems levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that  context,  not
all Member States have ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of  undue
payments[47].

    25.Have you experienced a situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction

                I.Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors  or
performers to producers[48] or determining who the owner of the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[49]. This is an area that has been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.


    21. [In particular if you are an author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
       mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that  you  receive
       an adequate remuneration for  the  exploitation  of  your  works  and
       performances?

 On top of the important role and responsibilities of the Public  sector  on
 this matter, I would suggest crowdfounding should be supported, for example
 with tax exemptions for givers. Also, I support a collective licence, and a
 suppression of third-party right managers.

    22. is there a need to act at the EU level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
       certain clauses in contracts)?

 L YES - Please explain

 Contracts should allow the author / creator to share its work (for example,
 as a writer of paperbooks, contracts give a certain number of copies to the
 writer. Then a digital writer should clearly be  authorized  to  share  its
 files a certain number of times)

 The contract should also state if DRM are used, what kind of DRM  and  why.
 The creator / writer / author should be able to forbid the use  of  DRM  on
 its work and clearly states it in the contract.

 The contracts should guarantee  how  many  years  the  work  will  be  made
 available. Also, it should state how the publisher intends to  keep  up  to
 date with the platforms and the technical evolutions.

Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised  framework  for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights.  The  Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text65.
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested that enforcement measures should always be available  in
case of infringement of
Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  29
April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights.
You will find more information on the following website:
htt.p://ec.eiiropa.eii/mtemal_market/iprenforcement/directive/mdex_enhtm

copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright
when the infringed content is used for a commercial purpose[50]. One means
to do this could be to clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP
infrastructure[51]. At the same time, there could be clarification of the
safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private
users.

    21.Should the civil enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a  commercial
      purpose?
 A YES - Please explain A NO - Please explain A NO OPINION
 Too often, there is an unclear line about "commercial purpose" because  the
 appreciation "fair use"/ Berne convention is  not  well  stated,  and  some
 platforms / products are especially aimed at  harvesting  quality  contents
 which was initially provided under a CC-NC licence and  never  cpmply  with
 it.

 For example, if a commercial magazine reproduces an article from a blog  on
 its website, it can be mere sharing or mere plagiarazation

 But the so-called infringements of copyright  are  likely  to  be  used  as
 Trojan horses for surveillance matters, so we must be very cautious on  the
 matter.

    22. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to  allow
      for  sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in  inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

 There should be NO involvement of the intermediates on the matter.

    23.Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure  that  the  right
      balance is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one's  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life and
      protection of personal data?


 L YES - Please explain L NO - Please explain
 It already gathers too much power to the providers and third-parties. Also,
 the trend which combines surveillance of Ips and /  or  social  network  to
 detect "copyright infingement" should be stopped.

 L NO OPINION

           I.A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in
the copyright debate for quite some time now, although views as to the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A unified EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a
truly Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured,
while others believe that the same objective can better be achieved by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States' legal systems.

    21. Should the EU pursue the establishment  of  a  single  EU  Copyright
      Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework  for  rights
      and exceptions to copyright across  the  EU,  as  well  as  a  single
      framework for enforcement?
 L YES
 L NO
 L NO OPINION

    22. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in  the
      EU? Does the current level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

 Reforming copyright is a good idea , however if it leads to more  technical
 measures to reinforce copyright enforcement and surveillance, it is not. So
 there is a need for  a  better  balance  which  does  not  result  in  more
 surveillance and invading practices.

         I.Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the
most important matters relating to the current EU legal framework for
copyright. Should any important matters have been omitted, we would
appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so they can be
properly addressed in the future.


   21.Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

The most important questions are:

    - how to address the new practices supported  by  a  growing  number  of
      contents producers

    - How not to hand copyright control over third-parties (i.e. providers /
      ISP, contents aggregators, social networks...)

    - How to develop fair retribution  for  the  creators  (which  licences,
      incentives  for  crowdfounding,  fiscal  incitations  aimed  at  small
      structures and independent  artists  without  being  captured  by  web
      giants)

Europe", C0M(2012) 529 final.

   of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.
   [9]      Film and  record  producers,  performers  and  broadcasters  are
   holders of so-called "neighbouring rights" in, respectively, their films,
   records,  performances  and  broadcast.  Authors'  content  protected  by
   copyright is referred to as a "work" or "works", while content  protected
   by neighbouring rights is referred to as "other subject matter".
   [10]      The  right  to  "authorise  or  prohibit  direct  or  indirect,
   temporary or permanent reproduction by any means  and  in  any  form,  in
   whole or in part" (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary
   acts of reproduction of a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under
   certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
   [11]     The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the
   public by wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making
   available to the public "on demand" (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[12]  See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L'Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[13]  The objective of implementing a "country of  origin"  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[14]  Injunctive relief is a temporary  or  permanent  remedy  allowing  the
right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.
[15]  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
[16]  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a secondhand  licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder's
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on  the  Computer  Programs  Directive.  It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[17]  For example, it  does  not  affect  "domestic"  works  -  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[18]  On the basis of Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[19]  E.g. the International Standard Recording  Code  (ISRC)  is  used  to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is  used
to identify books.

[27]  With the  exception  of  certain  limitations:  (i)  in  the  Computer
Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii)  Article  5(1)  in
the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
[28] Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive  (a
mandatory exception to copyright and related rights in the  case  where  the
rightholders  are  not  known  or  cannot  be  located)  has  been  given  a
crossborder effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary  work  -
for instance a novel - is considered an orphan work in a Member State,  that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States  and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.
 Fair use should be privileged and reinforced. The  notion  of  "fair  use",
 which covers parody rights, mash-ups  and  remixes,  and  also  informative
 reproduction of a work or of a  quote  /  extract  from  a  work,  is  very
 important for the digital culture and creativity.

b) [In particular if you are an end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
 specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books  or   other   materials
 electronically (e-lending), including  across  borders,  from  institutions
 such as public libraries?
c)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
 agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or  other  materials
 electronically, including across borders?
 A YES - for technical reasons (proprietary systems  taking  over  laws  and
 common sense) this hasn't work well.

 Very few libraries lend the equipement needed  (like  tablets)  for  proper
 digital  literature  (i.e.  specific   projects   which   implement   other
 technologies than numerization)
