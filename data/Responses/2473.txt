About EACA
EACA represents the advertising, media and sales promotions agencies across Europe to
enable sharing of international experience, as well as a platform for dealing with issues
affecting agencies on a pan-European level. We provide an important link between agencies,
advertisers and the advertising media in Europe and around the world. Our main goal is to
promote honest, effective advertising and high professional standards which benefit
consumers and businesses alike. As a result, the association is the leading representative
for the European commercial communications agencies. EACA membership is organised
into 5 councils:
    1. The International Agencies’ Council - the 13 largest international agencies in Europe;
    2. The National Associations’ Council - the national agency associations in 30 European
       markets, including all EU markets;
    3. The Integrated Marketing Communications Council - 8 national associations of leading
       sales promotion agencies in Europe;
    4. The Media Agencies’ Council - 8 international media networks;
    5. The Health Communications Council - the key players in European Health
       Communications.



General considerations
EACA would like to welcome the European Commission’s efforts to ensure that the EU
copyright framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment as a means to support
the development of creative industries and tap the full potential of the European Single
Market.
Creative work is at the heart of the advertising agency business - outstanding creative work
enables agencies to retain business as well as gain new clients. Through the pitch process,
agencies engage in a competition to win new business and present creative ideas and
examples of creative work. The protection of copyright is essential to ensuring that agencies
operate in a system of fair competition, which is a prerequisite for constant
development and innovation.
Because of this, EACA and WFA (World Federation of Advertisers) have adopted Guidelines
on Client-Agency Relations and Best Practice in the Pitch Process which state that “the
creative concepts produced under the conditions of an agency pitch remain the property of
the agencies. In case ideas produced by one or several of the agencies not selected are of
interest to the advertiser, the purchase of usage rights should be negotiated.”1
In the context of the Public Consultation on the Review of the EU Copyright Rules, EACA
would like to answer the following questions:
           II. C.   Registration of works
           VI       Respect for Rights

II.C. Registration of works

15.    Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification
and licensing of works and other subject matter?
16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
17.       What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

Registration of works can have a useful role in the identification of creative work. In the
advertising industry, several voluntary registration systems have been created in order to
help agencies protect their work:

         In Austria, the Professional Association of Advertising and Marketing Communication
          Industry (WKO) has set up the so-called “Ideentresor” where companies can
          voluntarily deposit creative work2.
         In Finland, there is a register3 for advertising slogans which is widely used and has
          proved to be efficient.
         In Italy, agencies have the possibility to register creative ideas through IAP (Istituto
          Autodisciplina Pubblicitaria). At the same time, the Italian Advertising Agencies
          Association (ASSOCOM), together with the Advertisers’ Association (UPA) is
          currently looking into setting up a system of registration for advertisements through
          an independent institute.
         In the United Kingdom, the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) has
          developed an online pitch protection and copyright register for advertising agencies.

The main benefit of such registers is that they provide a quick and easy way of ensuring the
tailored protection of copyright for a specific industry sector. EACA therefore believes that
registers should be provided on a voluntary basis so as to be tailored to the needs of
each industry sector.

At the same time, a potential disadvantage of setting up registers for copyright protection can
be legal uncertainty. While the afore mentioned examples have the potential to provide a
platform for the recognition of creative work owners, businesses need the certainty that
adhering to such registers will grant them legal protection. Hence, EACA would like to call for
a modern, flexible and robust copyright legislative framework that accommodates voluntary
registers as a legitimate means of ensuring tailored copyright protection.

VI. Respect for Rights

21.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

22.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to
foster the cooperation of intermediaries?


While the digital world has brought about new opportunities for the creation of content, it also
enables easy distribution and means of copyright infringement. Websites often operate in a
“grey” area which makes it difficult to ensure an efficient protection of copyrighted work.
EACA would like to welcome improvements both in the identification of copyright
infringements online as well as in civil enforcement mechanisms in order to ensure the
protection of copyright for all creative industries.
Finally, we would like to stress the importance of involving intermediaries in the process of
inhibiting online copyright infringements and we call on the European Commission to
welcome cross-industry voluntary action for identifying those who seek financial gain
through copyright infringement and for better protection of copyrighted work online.
