TYPE OF RESPONDENT (Please underline the appropriate):
     € Institutional user (e.g. school, university, research centre, library, archive)      OR
       Representative of institutional users
     € à for the purposes of this questionnaire normally referred to in questions as
       "institutional users"

This response is made by Electronic Information for Libraries (EIFL), an international not-
for-profit organization that works with libraries in more than 60 developing and transition
economy countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America1 to enable access to knowledge
for education, learning, research and sustainable community development.

EIFL partners with national library consortia - groups of libraries that work together to co-
ordinate activities, reduce duplication of effort and combine expertise for example, to manage
a joint automated library system, or to negotiate access to e-resources. EIFL works with
consortia in the following European countries that represent 645 libraries:

      •    EU Member States: Estonia2, Latvia3, Lithuania4, Poland5, Slovenia6
      •    EU candidate countries: Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia7, Serbia8
      •    Potential candidates: Albania9, Bosnia and Herzegovina10, Kosovo11

Libraries in other EIFL partner consortia throughout the world are affected by EU copyright
law and policy because bilateral trade and economic partnership agreements may require the
adaptation of local copyright laws in accordance with EU rules and standards.

EIFL welcomes the opportunity to respond to the European Commission Public Consultation
on the review of EU copyright rules. EIFL supports the submission of the International
Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA).

We hope that the consultation will help to inform global discussions at the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) on copyright Limitations and Exceptions that concern some of
the issues raised in this Consultation12. EIFL, together with IFLA and the International
Council on Archives (ICA), is advocating for an international instrument setting minimum,
mandatory limitations and exceptions for certain core library and archive activities.

     III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC13.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law14. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)15, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional16, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")17.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
17
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
Yes. EIFL believes that the exceptions in Directive 2001/29/EC should be made
mandatory. The Directive itself states that existing differences in the exceptions and
limitations to certain restricted acts have direct negative effects on the functioning of the
internal market of copyright and related rights, and that such differences could become
more pronounced in view of the development of trans-border exploitation of works.18.
Since the Directive was enacted in 2001, cross-border activities for information
resources have developed exponentially.

A requirement in international law to mandate certain uses of protected works stems
from the need to set limits to absolute protection in the public interest19. While
international treaties and European Directives have generally chosen to provide
permissive exceptions20, the two most recent examples of such instruments include both
mandatory exceptions and a cross-border effect: the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate
Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise
Print Disabled adopted by WIPO Member States in 2013, and the 2012 Orphan Works
Directive. Both instruments concern issues heightened by the digital environment, not
solved by the market that consequently required intervention by the legislator. These
policy responses, that EIFL supports, show that changing needs necessitate a modern
approach.

As the EU is expanded to 28 Member States and new technologies increase the desire for
cross-border co-operation, trans-national activities such as large-scale library

digitization projects, online learning opportunities and joint research information
infrastructures must be facilitated by law. The Study on the Application of Directive
2001/29/EC (2013) by De Wolf and Partners, commissioned by the European
Commission, found that mandatory exceptions could in particular be justified in the
case of the library exception to achieve, inter alia, a key policy objective to promote
Europe’s cultural heritage in the online environment21.

In order to ensure that the exceptions are given effect for licensed resources (that
concerns most electronic resources in libraries), the exceptions must be protected from
overrule by contractual terms in copyright contracts. Unlike Directive/96/9/EC	  on the
Legal Protection of Databases, and Directive/2009/24/EC on Computer Programs that
protects beneficiaries of exceptions from such contractual terms22, the InfoSoc Directive
gives priority to the rights of rightsholders.

As discussed in the De Wolf study “Where it is permissible to exclude the application of an
exception by contract on a national basis, the beneficiaries of the exception may find their
position weakened by the contractual practices of the right holders. This tension between
the exception and the possibility to override it by contract may have cross-border effects.” 23
Therefore discussion on making exceptions mandatory or harmonizing their effect, must
be accompanied by a measure that will give binding effect to the exceptions that are
otherwise subject to the consent of the rightsholder.

In addition to Member States that have opted to safeguard exceptions in contractual
terms24, the UK government accepted a recommendation by the Hargreaves Review of
Intellectual Property and Growth that contractual terms should not undermine the
benefits of exceptions25, and the report of the Copyright Review Committee in Ireland
makes a comprehensive recommendation to support exceptions against contract terms26.

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving27 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions28. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive29.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
 YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
EIFL notes that if implemented, these exceptions allow acts including of preservation
and archiving30.

2.      Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online

accessible libraries, educational establishments or museums, or by archives, which are not for direct or
indirect economic or commercial advantage”;


9                           Electronic Information for Libraries (EIFL)
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
Yes.
1. Publishers in developed countries demand very high prices for remote access to e-
resources by university students. This affects in particular small and medium sized
institutions, and institutions that are less well off. To give an example of the costs
involved in licensing electronic resources in a developed country, the national university
site licensing initiative in the UK31 manages agreements for 15 major journals with 15
publishers identified by the community as being important for their researchers and
students, at an annual cost of approx. £63 million (€75 million) of public funds in 2013.
These 15 agreements represent 60-70% of the total journal budgets. Due to the
monopolistic nature of copyright, libraries (in every country) are forced to pay the
prices charged and to adhere to whatever conditions are ultimately imposed, otherwise
they cannot have access to materials needed by their faculty and students.
2. Licences are country and governing law specific, and cross border access is not
allowed.
3. EIFL wishes to address in particular the issue of cross-border inter-library document
supply (ILDS). As no library can acquire every published work and some libraries have
specialist collections that are not available anywhere else, a library may wish to obtain a
copy of an item, in response to a request from an end user, from another library where
necessary. This established system of co-operation is known as “inter-library loan” for
returnable items such as books, and “inter-library document supply” for items such as a
copy of a book chapter or journal article. If the requested item is not available locally, it
can usually be requested from a library in another country. Inter-library document
supply services are a vital adjunct in meeting the specialist information meets of
scholars and researchers. ILDS must be supported through an exception because it is
not possible or practical for every library to obtain a licence for each item that may be
requested by an end user.

Here are two examples from EIFL partner countries that illustrate the need for an
exception:

Example 1. In 2013, a PhD student in Estonia was undertaking comparative research on
historiographical narratives in five Baltic and Nordic countries. The student needed to
consult materials and book chapters from c. 1920-1930 that were not available in

31
     https://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/nesli2/



10                               Electronic Information for Libraries (EIFL)
Estonia. The university library in Estonia sent electronic requests to libraries in Latvia,
Norway and Iceland that each had some of the requested materials in their collections.
Latvia satisfied the request, but it was not possible to get the material from either
Norway or Iceland due to copyright and licensing restrictions.
As a result the student could not get information that was needed purely for research
purposes that was important for their study. In these cases, it is especially hard for a
library to explain to the end user why they cannot reasonably get the material, and when
it seems to the end user that the only way to get information needed for their bona fide
research request is to circumvent the law – a bad outcome for copyright and for
libraries.
Example 2. Libraries in developing and transition economy countries often look to
major research libraries such as the British Library, the national library of the United
Kingdom, to obtain articles from serials and journals not available in institutions in
their own country. In January 2012, the British Library withdrew its copyright-based
Overseas Library Privilege Service, and replaced it with a publisher licensing
arrangement, known as the International Non-Commercial Document Supply (INCD)
service. Through INCD, overseas libraries serving educational users can order articles
from a limited number of journals under certain conditions at a reduced royalty rate.

However, there are important differences. Some items that are requested are no longer
available. Other items are available but have become prohibitively expensive because
they are not part of the INCD (non-commercial) title list, and so attract the publisher’s
full commercial royalty fee. New administrative obligations and conditions of use that
vary from publisher to publisher can apply that can create confusion and uncertainty -
variables include the territory of the library, electronic delivery to the end user may be
permitted or not, extra charges for direct supply may apply or not.

A library serving academic and research users in south-eastern Europe had been using
the British Library’s overseas document supply service since the 1980s. Until 2012, the
service was used frequently because it was fast, reliable and affordable. Now the licensed
service is being abandoned because it has become too strict and expensive to use. Some
items are not available, or are only available at commercial rates that are unaffordable.
For example, the price per article of some requested items increased from c. £13 to £52
(c. €15 to €63). The high costs have put the service out of reach for other libraries e.g. for
a library of education science in Lithuania.

An array of inflexible rules regarding supply options can create practical problems. In
particular, developing countries need reasonable options that can accommodate local
conditions. Librarians in Malawi have had supply problems with the licensed service.
Where the option of forwarding an electronic copy of that particular item to the end
user is not available, the end user is required to pick up a paper copy in person. So when
a researcher at Mzuzu University in Malawi requested such an item, they would have
had to travel over 440 km to the University of Malawi in Zomba, which is the location of
the account holder, the Malawi Library and Information Consortium (MALICO). In
addition, when it is not possible to send the item electronically to the end user due to
local connectivity problems, suitable alternative methods of delivery are needed
including download, print, scan or fax. Librarians need reasonable copyright and
licensing rules that work in the real world.

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
33.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
One suggestion to address the problem of the imbalance in negotiating power is through
the establishment of an independent body with intervening powers in case of abuse of
monopoly position by publishers. It could be styled, for example, on the work of the
European Ombudsman32. While the ombudsman model is largely used to resolve
complaints made by individuals against public bodies33, there are examples of
interventions in the private sector that might usefully be applied in the situation of
libraries and publishers described above34. We would welcome further exploration by
the Commission of this idea or alternatives that might help to diffuse tensions and
provide support to libraries in negotiating fair licences with publishers.

3.         E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

 36 (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across
borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
YES. EIFL provides examples of specific problems in two partner countries relating to
e-lending.
Example 1. Tallinn Central Library, a member of the Consortium of Estonian Libraries
Network (ELNET), is a public library that serves the city of Tallinn, Estonia. In part
due to high internet penetration, literature is becoming more widely available in English
than in Estonian, leading to concerns about the future reading, speaking and writing
skills of young people in Estonian. One of the Library’s objectives is the promotion of
the Estonian language, spoken by about 1.3 million people, and to increase access to
Estonian literature.

In 2012, the Library took the initiative to introduce Estonian e-books, that first became
available in 2009. With cooperation and goodwill from local publishers and authors, the
library has developed an e-book service known as ELLU (E-raamatute laenamis-
ja lugemiskeskkond) that has had success. But the process and basis of the system, that
depends on voluntary agreements with right holders, highlights problems that cannot be
overcome without changes to European copyright law. For example,

- libraries no longer have the right to decide for themselves which published books to
acquire – the loss of a fundamental freedom. The right holder can refuse a licence, or
impose an embargo period after publication. 58.7% of the Library’s requests for
Estonian titles have consequently been refused.

- the Library is therefore in an unequal bargaining position when seeking to negotiate
the terms and conditions of the licence. Such conditions, some of which act like digital
roadblocks that are counter-intuitive to the digital environment include single-user use
only; online, streamed access only - no downloading to a device; the licence is valid for
20 “loans” after which a new licence must be purchased (reduced from 35 “loans” in
2013).

- the process of seeking individual permission from publishers, or sometimes directly
from authors to acquire the title is costly and time-consuming even for a small country
such as Estonia, especially since the administration is handled by a single municipal
library.

Libraries, authors and publishers have a common goal to encourage reading and writing
in the Estonian language, essential to preserve national culture and identity. While the
market continues to develop, important issues such as fear of piracy and compensation
for authors for e-book lending are discussed with local publishers. But progress will be
slow and piecemeal until the intractable issue of copyright is addressed at European
level to give equal treatment to information carriers (print and electronic books), and
leverage to libraries to negotiate fair deals with right holders.

Example 2. The library community in neighbouring Latvia also seeks action at
European and international level to resolve the e-lending problem. During an eight
month project (2013) to develop agreement on best practice principles for e-book




13                       Electronic Information for Libraries (EIFL)
acquisition and lending35, a draft Memorandum of Understanding did not succeed in
getting publisher endorsement and efforts to offer e-books to library readers on
reasonable terms for libraries and their readers have stalled.

In the absence of a sound legal framework for e-lending, it can be expected that
frustrated readers will look elsewhere for their e-reading materials with the effect of
driving them away from literature in local languages, or towards illegal file-sharing
sites. At the same time, libraries will be forced to succumb to whatever access rules that
publishers and intermediaries set in order to fulfil reader expectations, thus forfeiting
their social mission to provide access to information to all members of society without
discrimination.

36.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
EIFL believes that libraries need a clear right to acquire commercially available e-
books, and to lend e-books under reasonable terms and conditions. While various cases
are pending before the European Court of Justice that relate to the issue of digital
exhaustion that may take many years to settle, the legislator should amend Directive
2001/29 to include a provision that prohibits the vendor from refusing to license, or to
sell a copy of, a commercially available copyright work to a library.
An independent body with intervening powers in case of abuse of monopoly position by
publishers (see question 33) could also be helpful.
The European Commission should share their experiences of library e-lending problems
at WIPO’s Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights under the agenda
item Limitations and Exceptions, and make proposals that seek a solution at
international level, such as that set out in the Treaty Proposal on Limitations and
Exceptions for Libraries and Archives from EIFL, IFLA, ICA and Innovarte36 that
reflects Principle 1 of the IFLA Principles for Library eLending37.

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other38. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective

Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)39.

40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
The 2011 MoU on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out
of commerce works recognizes that the large-scale digitisation and making available of
Europe's cultural heritage contained in the collections of publicly accessible cultural
institutions is in the public interest, as well as in the interest of the cultural and creative
sector.
EIFL notes that large-scale or “mass digitisation” by libraries is usually undertaken
within the context of a specific project or collection, and does not usually involve
scanning the entire content of a library (see the introduction to this section). Library
policies on digitization usually set out the scope and selection criteria (taking into
account copyright status or permission to digitize), technical standards and access.
Many policies can be viewed online.
EIFL can relate experiences concerning mass digitization as follows:
Experience from Lithuania:
Lithuanian copyright law (Article 22 Part 1 §3) contains an exception that enables
memory institutions to use a work for non-commercial research or personal study by
making it accessible via computer networks on the premises of the institution, provided
the work is not on public sale and the copyright holder has not prohibited its
exploitation. A library may reproduce copies of works but only for the technical purpose
of making them accessible via a computer network, and only up to the equivalent
number of copies held by the institution. This provision makes it very complicated to
make works accessible to library users.

Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania is authorized to perform the
function of representing the State in Europeana, the European Digital Library that is
co-funded by the European Commission, with a view to ensuring consistent promotion
of Lithuania’s cultural heritage and its dissemination in the area of European cultural
heritage. Accordingly, the Library is implementing two digitization projects funded by
EU Structural Funds.



39
  France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.



15                            Electronic Information for Libraries (EIFL)
In accordance with Lithuanian copyright law (Article 15), the Library signs agreements
with authors for works in commerce for the non-exclusive right to exploit such works by
digital reproduction or making publicly available. However restrictions in the
agreements mean that the Library cannot contribute certain important project
materials to Europeana. In some cases, it is impossible to get agreements at all because
although the works are not orphaned, the copyright status of the work still cannot be
ascertained.

The project “Development of the Virtual Electronic Heritage System” has difficulties
with musical works. According to the author agreements, musical works may only be
listened to, and only within the territory of the Republic of Lithuania. Other uses such
as downloading onto mobile devices are prohibited, as well as making the materials
publicly accessible via third party computer networks, including cross-border. As a
result, these works must be excluded from Europeana.

The second project concerns the digitization of works of modern classical literature
from the 20th and 21st centuries. For works in commerce, the National Library engages
in processes to find the author for every work that takes much time and financial
resources, and involves lengthy debates with publishers. One of the problems is that the
authors or other copyright holders, with whom agreements should be signed, often do
not know if the publisher is the owner of the copyright, for what period of time the
copyright has been transferred, or if this period has expired. In addition, translators,
illustrators, book or cover designers must also be found to give their permission.

Experience from Poland:

In Poland, the limitation of access to digitized material on dedicated terminals on the
premises is a huge problem for university libraries. A broad definition of “the premises”
is crucial for everyday activities. Digitization and mass preservation is a costly process.
Libraries (in Poland and elsewhere) believe that duplication of costly digitization efforts,
where an item is digitized by several times by different university libraries and is
available only on the premises of each particular library, is no longer feasible. Libraries
believe that in the near future they will share infrastructures for digitization activities.
Libraries need an exception that meets the realities of the online environment - a
modern equivalent of “on the premises” - that permits access at least within the network
of the library.

Experience from Latvia:

While the state invests in the digital preservation of protected works that are considered
part of the national heritage of Latvia, the digital works cannot usually be made
available for society to enjoy (even in low resolution formats). So there is no equality
between the interests of society, that has invested in the preservation of the work, and its
availability for the benefit of society.

Libraries in Latvia have highlighted problems digitizing photographs that are orphan
works e.g. photographs from Soviet times that do not include the photographer’s name,
and photographs from private collections. In rural areas, the local library (and museum)
is a quasi cultural centre for the region documenting local history, culture and customs.
Photos are an important part of studies and local publications, but it is hard for the



16                      Electronic Information for Libraries (EIFL)
institutions to undertake expensive investigations of copyright holders, and to make
qualitative decisions. As photographs are excluded from the scope of Directive
2012/28/EU on certain permitted uses of orphan works, libraries are looking to the
legislator to resolve this outstanding issue. (Subject-matter not currently included in the
scope of the Directive, in particular stand-alone photographs and other images, is
subject to review in the Directive by October 2015).

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC40 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 41.

The Marrakesh Treaty42 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with
disabilities:] Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works
published in special formats across the EU?
YES. EIFL will comment on cross-border problems relating to the provision of services
for persons with disabilities.
The Lithuanian Library for the Blind (LAB), a member of the Lithuanian Research
Library Consortium (LMBA), is a state-designated library with a mandate to ensure
that blind and visually impaired people have equal rights to access information,
participate in social life and learn about Lithuanian culture. LAB is the only producer of
talking books – about 200 titles annually - in Lithuania. For school children and
students, LAB produces academic materials in the user’s preferred format e.g. enlarged
text, MP3, read by a speech synthesiser, and in multi-formats that comprise merged text
and audio files. The copies are made under an exception in the Lithuanian Copyright
and Related Rights Act (2012) Article 10.

In 2010, a Virtual Library for the Blind (known as ELVIS), co-funded by the European
Regional Development Fund, was established to provide materials in DAISY and other
digital formats to end-users. Since then, 228 registered users who are blind, low sighted

or have a print disability can download or stream about 7,000 digital audio publications
that has helped to empower readers who no longer have to travel to the library.

There are two problems relating to cross-border services.
(1) While special format material is available only in the Lithuanian language, national
minorities in Lithuania need literature in other languages. For example, books in Polish
and Russian are in demand among senior readers, who constitute the greater part of the
readership. However receiving physical and digital material from libraries in other
countries, even within the EU, is difficult or impossible due to copyright rules.
(2) With increased migration and movement of peoples around Europe, there is a
growing demand for materials from Lithuanians with a visual disability living in other
countries. For example, LAB has been contacted by emigrants living in Germany,
Ireland, and Norway who would like to get reading material in their own language
through ELVIS. As the service develops, LAB envisages increased demand from
qualified users living abroad. The lack of a unified copyright exception throughout
Europe, and the lack of import/export provisions is a major impediment to the service.
In addition, the definition of persons with a visual impairment in the 2012 Act does not
include other reading disabilities, such as dyslexia.


51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
EIFL urges the European Commission to ratify and implement the WIPO Marrakesh
Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually
Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. The Commission should expedite its
transposition into EU law as a matter of urgency and amend, if necessary, Directive
2001/29/EC. Ratification would be in line with the European Disability Strategy 2010-
2020 that aims to ensure effective participation in society on an equal basis with others
by, inter alia, removing legal barriers to education and lifelong learning systems.
It is 29 years since a joint WIPO-UNESCO report recommended an international
instrument that would permit production and distribution of accessible formats. EU
ratification should not be bundled with other copyright issues under consideration, as
this could have the effect of further delaying implementation into national law by
several years. The current situation represents a market and a policy failure that must
be fixed without delay.
It is really unfortunate that persons with disabilities other than print disabilities, such as
deaf people, were excluded from negotiations in the Marrakesh Treaty. In order to
maintain the inclusive formulation of Article 5(3)b of Directive 2001/29, the provisions
of the Treaty should be extended for the benefit of European citizens with any disability,
to the extent required by the specific disability. An inclusive definition of the
beneficiaries would avoid the inadvertent creation of a two-tier system of access to
information depending on the nature of the disability.

52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
