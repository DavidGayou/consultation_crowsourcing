Type Of Respondent:




X Other:
The Nexa Center for Internet for Internet & Society at Turin’s Polytechnic
University (Department of Automatic and Informatics, DAUIN), is an
independent research center, focusing on interdisciplinary analysis of the
Internet and of its impact on society. It was created in 2003 and has
coordinated various EU thematic networks (including Communia and Lapsi).
Understanding the Internet, its limitations and potential, is an indispensable
course of action to ensure economic, technical, scientific, cultural and social
development for the years to come; where possible, from any standpoint.

       I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.    Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one
in which you live?
  YES
  NO
X NO OPINION


2.     [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?
  YES
  NO
X NO OPINION


3. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if
possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the
Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.
//
4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above
– what would be the best way to tackle them?
//
5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it
necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider
(in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible
in certain European countries)?
  YES
  NO
X NO OPINION

                                         2
6.       [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there
reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights
for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to
redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to
access)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples


X NO OPINION


7.      Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-
border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an
adequate level of protection for right holders?
  YES – Please explain
  NO – Please explain
X NO OPINION



B.      Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs
to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


                    1.     The act of “making available”
8.      Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations –
i.e. when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
  YES
X NO – Making a work available to the public includes various acts: 1)
uploading a file onto a server; 2) making this file accessible to the public; 3)
therefore allowing a discrete transmission of the file to every single member
of the public who wants to access such work; 4) through streaming or
obtaining a permanent copy (i.e. downloading). Because it is not clear which
of these acts triggers the making available right and where the act can be
localized, said right needs to be specified especially when the exploitation
occurs cross-border.
                                          3
It is worth noting that a single EU Copyright Title as advocated below would
solve the above-mentioned problem.

Under the current rules, the notion of making available would require a
transmission (i.e., a technical act of emission or transfer) which gives rise to
the potential reception of the work by the public (see Art. 3 Information
Society Directive 2001/29; Recital 23 of 2001/29; Travaux Preparatoires of
2001/29 - Commission Proposal COM (97) 628 Final, 25; Case C-306/05 SGAE
v. Rafael Hoteles).

With regards to the definition of “to the public”, the ECJ has already adopted
the “targeting approach” and has stated that, if a prior form of
communication has previously occurred, then the public must be a new
public (Case C- 306/05 SGAE; joined Cases C-403/08 and C-429/08 Football
Association Premiere League and Others; Case C-466/12 Svensson).

Additionally, the territorial reach of making available would include the
“country of origin” which means that the making available right occurs in the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or the service provider is
established.

Therefore, the ECJ is the best entity to further clarify this approach, using as
a basis, existing provisions and case law. A legislative intervention (other
than the adoption of a single EU Copyright Title) might on the contrary, risk
to be too rigid in view of future technological developments (e.g.
unanticipated evolutions of cloud computing).

 NO OPINION


9.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the
territorial scope of the “making available” right have an effect on the
recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or
not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on
your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability
of injunctive relief)?
X YES – A clarification on the territorial scope of the making available right
may become important from the licensing and enforcement perspectives.
From the licensing viewpoint, the individual or the company acquiring the
rights to make the work available online (i.e., via streaming or downloading)
would want to know if their rights would need to be obtained: 1) in every
Member State where the work could be accessed, 2) where the public could
be targeted, and/or 3) where the upload could take place. They would also
                                       4
      want to know the territorial scope in situations of territorial fragmentation,
      where rights are granted to different parties in different territories.
      Furthermore, rightholders would want to know what the applicable law is.
      The same applies considering the enforcement perspective; in fact,
      rightholders would want to know if they could initiate an enforcement action
      in every Member State where the public is targeted, where the content is
      accessible, or in the country of origin, and whether these jurisdictional links
      are alternative or cumulative.
      Additionally, a clarification of the territorial scope of the making available
      right might have an effect on:
      1.     The authorship and ownership of a work because currently there is
      no EU harmonisation on this matter and different Member State laws could
      be applied (for example, the different Member States’ rules on collective
      works or works made in the course of employment).
      2.      Remuneration because the rightholder could receive a remuneration
      for the exploitation that occurs in every Member State where the public is
      targeted, where the content is accessible, or only in the country of origin.
        NO
        NO OPINION



                 2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
      10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online
      environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?
      X YES – The cumulative application of the reproduction right and of the
      making available right to the same process could have the following
      consequences: 1) more difficulties for the individual or company who wants
      to obtain the relevant rights because the two rights may not necessarily be
      held by the same entity, 2) more parties in cases of infringement and too
      many duplications of a single infringement1, and 3) more transaction costs.

1
  As an example of the problems deriving from the application of two rights to a single economic act,
consider the following situation: In Italy, where there is no broadband connection usable for streaming
services of in-store music, the service provider has to reproduce the single music file on the client’s
computer for the public performance. This reproduction is just a technical mean of the public
performance for the client and does not have an economic value as such. Nevertheless, the rightholder
can claim a licence for this technical reproduction which is similar to the ephemeral reproduction in
streaming. Recently, an Italian service provider was fined for not only the copies he had on his server but
                                                    5
      Therefore, any overlaps in the application of the reproduction right, the
      making available right, and the communication right should be avoided to
      the extent possible.
      In our view:
      1.     Preliminary acts of reproduction (upstream reproductions) should
      be considered free or subject to an implied license, as they are necessary for
      making available the work (Zweckübertragung theory).
      2.     Downstream temporary reproductions on RAM storage for personal
      use of the work are similarly free because they are exempted by the
      mandatory exception provided in Art. 5.1 b) InfoSoc. Directive. Whereas,
      permanent reproductions made by the final user needs to be specifically
      authorized unless an implied licence could be affirmed under the
      circumstances of the case (relying again on the Zweckübertragung theory).
      If judicial clarification is not forthcoming, legislative action would be
      required.
           NO
           NO OPINION

                               3.      Linking and browsing
      11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
           YES
      X NO – Hyperlinking must not be subjected to the authorisation of the
      rightholder and it should not be considered an act of communication to the
      public for the following reasons:
      1.         It does not involve a transmission, and
      2.         It is not directed to a new public (see above answer to Question 8).
      We believe that providing a link (hyperlink or deep-link) is equivalent, in
      general, to providing information on the location of a page that the user can
      decide to access or not access. Providing information on the place where the

also for the copies of the same songs reproduced on his clients’ computers. In addition to criminal
penalties for copyright infringement, Art. 174 bis of Law 22 April 1941, n. 633 introduced an
administrative penalty not less than €103,00 for every infringement or reproduction without
distinguishing whether the reproduction has any economic value or is just a technical mean to engage in
a public performance. As a consequence of this law, the service provider was fined €43.828.354,00 for
the technical reproduction of 1,531 music files on 300 clients’ computers, irrespective that the
remuneration for the performance had been paid.
                                                  6
source is located is different from transmitting the work available in the
source. Therefore, it cannot infringe copyright, even though willful
inducement of third parties’ infringement and cooperation with it may
trigger indirect or contributory liability.
Linking is a form of “citation to the copyright works” and the ability to
cite/hyperlink is a key feature of the way the Internet operates (T. APLYN,
Copyright Law in the Digital Society, Oxford, Hart, 2005).
The recent ECJ decision in Svensson (C 466/12) ruled that a hyperlink is a
form of communication but it cannot be considered communication to the
public if a new public is not involved. Nonetheless, the Court did not clarify
whether the act of communication necessarily has to involve a transmission
(see above answer to Question 8) and did not consider the case in which the
hyperlink addresses the user to a manifestly illegal source.
As far as framing is concerned, the question of whether frames should be
qualified as communication to the public is currently pending before the ECJ
in the case Bestwater International (C-348/13). Therefore it is suitable to
wait for the decision.
 NO OPINION


12.     Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on
the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or
under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?
 YES
X NO – Temporary reproduction should be covered by a mandatory
exception (see G. Guglielmetti, Riproduzione e riproduzione temporanea, in
AIDA, 2002, p. 38; M. Ricolfi, Comunicazione al pubblico e distribuzione, in
AIDA, 2002, p. 68).
As explained by the U.K. Supreme Court on 17 April 2013 in the Meltwater
case, the copies in cache memory or on the screen are considered “…the
automatic result of browsing the Internet… it requires no human
intervention other than the decision to access the relevant web-page… its
deletion is equally the automatic result of the lapse of time coupled with the
continuing use of the browser.”
The opposite interpretation would allow Internet users to be susceptible to
liability if they merely browsed the Internet and ended up on a page which
contained works protected by copyright.

                             4.       Download to own digital content
      13.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced
      restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g.
      mp3 file, e-book)?
      X YES –The most common online platforms that sell digital files do not
      actually give the consumer an ownership on the content but instead, just
      gives a long term licence for personal use2. Therefore, rights licensed by the
      rightholder to the online platform can have contractual limits or (in some
      cases) restrictions deriving from Digital Rights Management which usually
      does not provide the opportunity to legally resell the obtained digital files.
      Nonetheless, we think that this type of contractual restriction has to be
      removed. The principle codified in Art. 4.2 Computer Program Directive
      should be introduced in the InfoSoc Directive. Additionally, the ECJ’s decision
      in Oracle v. Used-Soft (C-128/11) should be applied generally and not only to
      computer programs especially considering the principle of equality and non-
      discrimination in technology.
      If a limitation or exception is mandatory, then technical protection measures
      and DRM should be made ineffective by the legal tools designed in such a way
      as to take into account the total failure by Art. 6 InfoSoc Directive to deal
      with the issue. Prompt redress mechanism backed by monetary penalties
      should be established.
         NO
         NO OPINION


      14.    [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would
      be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of
      previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of
      content) concerned.

  For example, Apple’s iTunes Terms of Service states “You agree that the iTunes Products are provided to you by
way of a licence only. You understand that the Service and certain iTunes Products include a security framework
using technology that protects digital information and limits your use of iTunes Products to certain usage rules
(‘Security Framework’) established by iTunes and its licensors and that, whether or not iTunes Products are limited
by security technology, you shall use iTunes Products in compliance with the applicable usage rules established by
iTunes and its licensors (‘Usage Rules’), and that any other use of the iTunes Products may constitute a copyright
infringement.”

C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


15.      Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?
X YES
  NO
  NO OPINION


16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
First, we make a few clarifications of our view on the subject.
The “no formalities” rule to avoid discrimination against foreigners set forth
in the Berne Convention is no longer supported by its original rationale.
Today, registration does not need to be a cumbersome formality to be
repeated in each country. Instead, ideally the requirement could be met by a
single registration in a global online digital registry either administered by
WIPO or by distributed systems. In the intermediate stage, the first step
could be to establish an EU-wide registration system which could either be
unitary or bring together EU Member States’ registries. This European
system could trigger a process of regulatory competition; encourage other
non EU-members to join or to set up their own systems; and in the medium
term, a reform of Berne rules might follow. Research on private registries
undertaken by WIPO has shown that the cost for setting up and maintaining
virtual registries are low and are bound to decrease. On the contrary, a
failure to keep registers may entail enormous costs including clearance costs
and recurrent non-availability of orphan and out of print works. Therefore,
we think that the time has come to set up a global or EU-wide online system
for the registration of works. In this perspective, we support the idea that
registration in an online registry should be established and made optional
and available to those who wish to claim a “stronger” protection of their
work; meaning they wish to reserve the rights necessary to commercially
exploit their works (under the current paradigm which could be called
“Copyright 1.0” or the “all rights reserved” paradigm).
On the other hand, if no registration is made, then the so-called “Copyright
2.0” would apply and create a mitigated exclusivity granting creators a

                                        9
limited set of rights including the right to attribution. Adopting this solution,
which links online registration of works to their copyright status, would
entail additional benefits from the ones already mentioned earlier.
In this model, Copyright 1.0 would survive and be put on a firm footing.
Meaning creators and businesses could explicitly choose by means of a low-
cost registration to retain the right to commercially exploit the works they
own in an exclusive position, while at the same time, put third parties in a
position to ascertain rightholders’ willingness to claim protection by
consulting the register. Creators should opt-in for Copyright 1.0 at the time of
the original release of their work; otherwise the new Copyright 2.0 would
operate as a default set of provisions. This online registration system might
evolve in time by incorporating a requirement that all transactions
(assignments, licenses, collateralization etc.) concerning digitally recorded
works are recorded in the same register. It is also possible to envisage that
all future deeds concerning Copyright 1.0 works are declared effective only if
and from the moment they are recorded. If this is the case, then the road
would finally be opened to make copyrighted works available as collateral
for outside financing. This would be a remarkable step forward. At the
moment, the balance sheets of EU corporations are no longer formed mainly
by material assets (plants, machinery, inventory, etc.). Instead, many major
assets are intangible. For many corporations, databases, software and
copyright actually form a large part of their assets. In the media and content
industry, intangible assets may well exceed over 90% of the overall book
value of all assets. Research carried out across the legal systems of various
EU countries in this area (see A. Tosato, Security Interests over Intellectual
Property, in J. Int. Property Law and Practice, 2011, 93 ss.; P. Auteri, Il pegno
del diritto di autore: costituzione e opponibilità nei confronti dei terzi, in
AIDA 2009, 129 ff.; C. Woeste, Immaterialgüterrechte als Kreditsicherheit im
deutschen und US-amerikanschen Recht, Universitätsverlag Rasch,
Osnabrück, 2002) has shown that the major hurdle to using copyright assets
as collateral for outside financing is the unavailability of a comprehensive
and secure system of registration of all transactions over copyrighted works.
Corresponding and possibly larger benefits would accrue in the Copyright
2.0 sector. Everyday the internet incorporates several billions of new works.
We are most familiar with Blogs, Facebook, and Twitter posts. Additionally,
each of us have probably made available over the internet one or more e-
mails, WhatsApp messages, web content, or other materials which would
attract copyright protection even if we are not interested in it. In fact, we
resent the limitations in dissemination which the current copyright status
imposes on them. Now, the creation of online registries would enable the
simultaneous (and “voluntary”) liberalization of all works standing outside
of the registries. Moreover, creators who wish to disseminate their work
                                      10
without any obstacle, except (as already pointed out) limit duties as to the
correct attribution of the work to the author, could simply omit to register
the work, thereby signaling that the work is freely re-usable.
Scholars and interested professionals, who have recently discussed similar
proposals (including Copyright 2.0), also suggested that creators, who opt for
online registration which triggers old Copyright 1.0, should be required to
indicate the reference of the registration in any publication/release of the
work to facilitate the identification of the regime to which the work is
subjected to. The ultimate goal of this approach is not to displace old
copyright, which seems to be alive and well in many situations, but to add to
the menu a second possibility: Copyright 2.0, which would be better tailored
to accommodate the production and distribution of works prevailing in the
current digital environment.
The advantages created by such a system would be numerous:
1.      Greatly reduce transaction costs because licensing activity would be
limited to works which have been registered.
2.     Enhance dissemination of works.
3.     Reduce controversies, in regard to the works, as there would be
much more certainty on the regime of each work and on the identity of
rightholders.
4.     Altogether solve the problem of orphan works which are already
addressed in a stop-gap fashion by Dir. 2012/28/EU.
5.      Create a huge quasi-commons consisting of Copyright 2.0 works
available for education, scientific research, data analytics.


17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
The possible costs for registration. In this respect, the experience with
private copyright registers shows that a global online registration service
should be supplied at a minimal cost.
In any case, it can be important to underline that no inconsistency problems
with the Bern Convention regime are at stake. In fact, even before a revision
of the Berne Convention, a registration requirement adopted at the EU level
would be perfectly in line with the current international copyright provision.
That is, if it were not a pre-condition for regular copyright enforcement but
only for selected, if crucial, enforcement modalities (e.g. protection of
Technical Protection Measures and Digital Rights Management) standing to
sue ISPs. See Stef van Gompel, Formalities in Copyright Law: An Analysis of

                                     11
Their History, Rationales, and Possible Future, Alphen aan den Rijn, Kluwer
Law International, 2011.
18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
1.     Copyright 1.0, the “all right reserved” paradigm, would apply.
2.      The possibility to obtain a registered title which could be effective
against any third party.
3.      Intangible copyright 1.0 assets could be offered as collateral in order
to obtain financing (see above incentive #2)
4.     Registrants would obtain publicity through the registration and
dissemination of their works and therefore create more certainty on the
information of rights and on the identity of rightholders.
5.     Creators would also be easily identified which could enhance their
potential to obtain business through the exposure of their work at a global
level.



D.     How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


19.     What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption
of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and
interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
The adoption of identifiers could improve transparency in the management
of authors’ rights. Collecting societies would play a key role in this process.
Since the EU currently does not have legislation on collective management,
the first step is to put in place an appropriate legal framework according to
the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on
Collective Management of Copyright and Related Rights and Multi-Territorial
Licence of Rights in Musical Works for Online Uses in the Internal Market.
Pursuant to this proposal, each Member State would need to ensure that the
collecting societies established in their territory comply with the
requirements provided in Art. 22.2 including the adoption of interoperable
and shared identifiers. However, to the extent identifiers contain metadata
on licensing terms and economic conditions, they should be subject to close
antitrust scrutiny to avoid anticompetitive and abusive practices.




                                      12
E.     Term of protection – is it appropriate?


20.      Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
digital environment?
 YES
X NO – It should be shorter.
Economists have criticized the overlong term of copyright protection and
particularly “re-troactive” extensions, which of course cannot incentivize
dead creators to create. The present duration of rights withholds the works
from the public domain for an excessive period of time at the exclusive
benefit of the rightholder, which in fact tend to be businesses rather than
creators, without real advantages for the creators, the artists, or the
performers.
For works of utilitarian nature, including software and databases, 70 (or 50)
years after the death of the creator(s) is without doubt an excessive term.
It is true that the current rules cannot be changed without renegotiating the
Berne Convention. This is a good reason to conceive the current European
exercise as a stepping stone towards a more extensive recasting of copyright
law: Berne II is long overdue. In the meantime, the EU should discourage any
TRIPs-plus agreements which entail the extension of the term beyond the
mandated 50-plus years. It is also true that the shortcomings of the present
system would be greatly decreased by the adoption of a Copyright 2.0
approach, which enables the majority of protected work to be subject to a
more open regime. This is a good reason to direct a Berne II revision in the
direction of a dual regime, contemplating a Copyright 2.0 option.

     II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21.     Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member
States?


                                      13
X YES –The optional character of Art. 5 InfoSoc Directive, specifically
paragraphs 2 and 3, has prevented the substantial harmonisation of Member
States’ limitations and exceptions in copyright.
  NO
  NO OPINION


22.     Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
X YES –Yes, to a large degree. One reason is to make sure that harmonisation
is effective. There are also reasons on the merits which are advanced to
support making certain limitations and exceptions mandatory. One reason is
discussed below in our answer to Question 24. Another reason refers to file
sharing. It is often argued that file sharing allows free and easy spreading
within society of a larger diversity of contents; that legalising file sharing of
copyrighted works could foster cultural diversity and freedom of expression.
In this perspective, file sharing for private use of copyrighted works should
be allowed with payment of a levy. Such exception should be mandatory and
harmonized at the EU level. Sharing of copyrighted works within a circle of
family and friends should also be allowed without payment of a levy.
If a limitation or exception is mandatory, then technical protection measures
and DRM should be made ineffective by legal tools designed in such a way as
to take into account the total failure by Art. 6 InfoSoc Directive to deal with
the issue. Prompt redress mechanism backed by monetary penalties should
be established.
  NO

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed
from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
See above answer to Question 22.

24.    Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations
and exceptions?
X YES –It has been noted that traditional, civil law “closed lists” of exceptions
and limitations could be complemented well by a U.S. style open-ended fair
use clause. In this situation, the matter would be settled when a situation
                                       14
defined in the closed list occurs. However, when this is not the situation, the
U.S. style open-ended fair use would set in. It is argued that this approach
would combine the benefits of certainty and flexibility. It is further argued
that this would greatly enhance downstream innovation and creativity which
is needed due to the fast rate of change which prevails in media services and
technologies.

25.     If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the
directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the
form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain
indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such
an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal
Market.

See above answer to Question 24.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your
experience, constitute a problem?
X YES –The Orphan Works Directive has shown that it is possible to adopt a
“country of origin” approach to limitations and exceptions, and that in this
limited regard, territoriality may be overcome. This approach should be
extended and duplicated in all fields in which a digital driven-network exists
or is possible in the foreseeable future.
  NO
  NO OPINION


27.     In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national
level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair
compensation” be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception?
(e.g. who pays whom, where?)
Collective rights management organisations were created to deal with this
kind of issue. The rate should be set on the basis of the “footprint” of the use
under the exception; collected centrally (at the country of origin identified
under the Orphan Works Directive) and redistributed to rightholders not
from the country of origin (if any).

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives


                    1.     Preservation and archiving
28.      (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive
specific works or other subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with
the use by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the
preservation exception?

X YES
1. Digitization.
Libraries and archives have almost been entirely prevented from digitizing
their collections by current copyright legislation. Generally, they are not
allowed to make digital copies of protected materials hosted in their
collections although public libraries and archives can make digital copies of
phonograms, cinematographic, or audio-visual works and moving images.
This exemption is clearly ineffective. On the one side, it does not allow the
digitization of protected materials (such as books and photographic works)
which are no less in danger of getting lost due to their characteristics (e.g.
perishable or obsolescent media) or to their intensive use. On the other side,
the exception covers only the making of one copy (which is clearly not
enough). As a matter of fact, digital preservation typically requires multiple
acts of reproduction, either for the sake of format-shifting, backing-up,
updating, migrating, or merging the databases of the library or archive.
2. Archiving and preserving digital-born copies.
For the same reason, libraries and archives are prevented from effectively
managing their collections of digital-born copies of protected works. As
already mentioned, the law allows them to make only one digital copy of
works and protected materials that fall into specific categories; outside such
limits, libraries and archives cannot simply make another digital copy
lawfully. As a consequence, they cannot transfer a database (or the visual or
textual materials contained therein) or a multimedia work from a DVD to the
hard-disk containing the entire digital collection of the institution. Moreover,
making additional copies for the purpose of format-shifting would amount to
making new, infringing copies.
3. Acquisition versus access.


                                        16
Libraries, particularly academic ones, are increasingly investing part of their
budget in digital subscriptions. By doing so, they obtain a right to access a
database for a limited period of time instead of a permanent copy of books,
journals, and other sources of information. Sometimes they are forced to do
so because of the sky-rocketing prices of books and journals or the non-
availability of a paper substitute. However, in the long run this practice is
likely to produce adverse effects on one of the functions traditionally
performed by such institutions, namely harvesting copies of works,
preserving our cultural heritage, and passing information on to future
generations.
Sometimes this effect can be mitigated when a service provider assumes a
contractual obligation to guarantee a permanent access to all or some of the
information contained in its database. However, problems may still arise. For
example, if the service provider becomes bankrupt, it is very likely that the
dissolution of his enterprise would also take away the right of the library to
remotely access its account. Given the above, a far better solution would be
to make permanent copies of the pieces of information obtained through
such services (i.e. individual works, not the entire database) and archive
them as a part of the collection owned by the library. However, none of the
existing exceptions to copyright seem to apply and, at any rate, they would
most probably be displaced by contractual terms forbidding such activities.
4. Open access.
Since 2004 the Conference of Italian Universities has promoted the Berlin
declaration on Open Access among its members and today more than 70
Italian universities have already adhered. As a result, many of these
universities have set up a digital, online repository to collect the scientific
works of their researchers. Furthermore, some institutions have enacted
regulations to provide strong incentives for the researchers who consent to
making their works available online, free of charge, through an open access
academic archive.
It is too soon to assess the full outcome of such initiatives as their
implementation has only just started. However, a few problems have already
emerged. Building a repository and setting up an open access archive
requires the cooperation of both the researcher and the publisher. In
particular, the former should do two things: 1) evaluate if the contracts he
has already signed would allow him to upload his works in the academic
repository (i.e. without making them publicly accessible) or, eventually,
make his works available to the public through the open access archive of his
university (with or without a licence which would make his works re-usable
and not just freely accessible); and 2) ensure the publishing of his new works
under contractual terms and conditions which give him such freedom.
                                       17
The first task is not an easy one since very often the publishing agreement is
not in writing or does not clearly state which rights are transferred or
licensed by the author. Even though this uncertainty could possibly be solved
by relying on rules and principles contained in our copyright law, it is very
likely that the researcher (and his university) will not take the chance of
violating the rights transferred or licensed to the publisher. As a
consequence, the academic open access archive (and the public interest
justifying its creation) suffers an unwarranted deprivation.
If one looks at the second task, more reasons of concern arise. The market
for academic publications is getting more and more concentrated since
almost all major national publishers have been absorbed within very few
multinational companies or groups. As a matter of fact, these multinational
companies control the most prominent journals and series of books, which in
turn allows them to determine unilaterally terms and conditions of
publishing agreements offered to researchers and universities. Frequently,
these contracts buy-out all copyrights in the would-be-published works,
therefore giving the publisher the last word about if and when the works will
be uploaded in the academic repositories and, eventually, made available to
the public free of charge. Accordingly, researchers and universities are
forced to depend on the cooperation of their publishers, who have been far
from enthusiastic. After being invited to declare their “open access
policy”(the conditions that they would like to see applied to works published
on their journals or books series), the majority of publishers have either
remained silent or declared the conditions which are too restrictive,
requiring long terms embargoes if not prohibiting entirely such re-uses.
5. Consultation services.
If libraries are not allowed to digitize their own collections (no. 1, 2 and 3),
then they are also prevented from organizing their services in a modern way.
Firstly, they cannot take advantage of the exception for on-site, digital
consultation services (Art. 5[3][n] InfoSoc Directive): if the content is not
available, it does not make sense to put dedicated terminals in the libraries.
Secondly, they cannot offer printing services (i.e. printing – to paper or to
.pdf files – a digital copy of the book), even though printing has the same
effect as photocopying but does not damage the original. Thirdly, they cannot
reply to inter-library loan requests by simply sending a digital copy instead
being forced to waste time and resources with mail services instead.
Fourthly, they cannot lend digital copies (hosted by a physical support – like
a CD or DVD or e-book reader) of fragile or rare originals.
6. Participation to European networks.


                                      18
The aforementioned constraints have another side effect which is
particularly odious for institutions like universities and public research
centres that are used traditionally for openness and participation in wide,
international networks. Being incapable of digitizing their own collections,
Italian libraries and archives are prevented from cooperating with other
European cultural institutions and share the costs of building digital
repositories which, sooner or later, could be made accessible to the public as
a source of information or as an instrument to elaborate new information
(i.e. for big data analysis).

  NO OPINION


29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


The problems that were mentioned in our answer to Question 28 can best be
solved through a legislative reform of the InfoSoc Directive.

It is true that some of the problems are caused by Italian law and could be
solved locally to take advantage of the freedom given to national legislators,
through Art. 5(2)(c) InfoSoc Directive, which allows Member States to
exempt specific acts of reproduction made by archives and publicly
accessible libraries. However, there are uncertainties on the exact meaning
of this rule, particularly in respect to what a “specific act of reproduction”
may be and as to the purposes of the reproductions that could be exempted.
Moreover, reforming Italian copyright law would neither solve the problem
on the lack of harmonisation (confirmed recently by the Study on the
Application of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright and Related Rights in the
Information Society, commissioned by the EU Commission and published in
2013, at 272 ff.) which prevents partnerships and joint initiatives among
European institutions (e.g. universities or research centres), nor does it
introduce any new exemptions beyond the exhaustive lists of Art. 5 InfoSoc
Directive.

Additionally, there are issues (e.g. relating to open access) which are
comparatively new and, therefore, not taken into account by the InfoSoc
Directive. While it may be argued again that some of them can be solved by
national legislators, actually, it does not seem wise to allow national laws to
go their own way since this would curtail the ability of the EU to realize some
of its core policies (see, Study on the Application of Directive 2001/29/EC on
Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society, commissioned by
the EU Commission and published in 2013, at 285).

30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its
main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be
covered and under which conditions?
1. Digital libraries and archives.

Art. 5(2)(c) InfoSoc Directive should be clarified, extended, and made
mandatory.

Firstly, archives and public accessible libraries should be allowed to make all
digital copies necessary to digitize and preserve their collection of works,
including works acquired through digital subscription services and digital
harvesting.

Secondly, they should be authorized to use such digital copies to perform
their traditional services, namely 1) providing access on site, 2) lending
individual copies, 3) allowing their patrons to make private copies, and iv)
sending copies to other libraries upon request (inter-library lending).

Thirdly, they should be allowed to provide additional services, namely access
to their digital collections for data mining purposes.

Fourthly, they should be allowed to distribute digital copies of their works to
archives and publicly accessible libraries which already possess an analog
copy of the same works (thereby sharing the costs of digitization, in a way
which maximizes societal benefits).

Lastly, they should be allowed to make available online works which are
already out of print or out of commerce, subject to the payment of an
equitable compensation to the rightholders (see, below answer to Question
40).

2. Open access.

Open access policies may have a chance to reach their goal only if the law
takes care of protecting researchers against buy-out contracts increasingly
offered by major scientific publishers. To this end, a viable solution could be
to give researchers who have assigned or licensed the exclusive right to
publish their scientific works, the unwaivable right to make such works
available to the public through academic open access archives when a
reasonable period of time (i.e., 6 or 12 months) has lapsed from their
publication by the assignee or licensee.

Additionally, it could be expressly stated that a contract assigning or
licensing exclusive rights in a scientific work which has been created in the
fulfilment of a publicly-funded research project is null and void, given that
                                       20
such work should be made available to the public according to open access
principles (for example, the rules governing Horizon 2020).



31.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
//



              2.     Off-premises access to library collections
32.      (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders
that enable you to provide remote access, including across borders, to your
collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other
subject-matter held in the collections of institutions such as universities and
national libraries when you are not on the premises of the institutions in
question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access,
including across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their
collections, for purposes of research and private study?
Generally speaking, Italian libraries have not invested in extensive
digitization projects and, therefore, have not accumulated enough
experience with the application of the exemption for on-site consultation
through digital means. As already mentioned, this may be due to the absence
of a reasonable exemption covering the digitization of analog collections. In
this regards, it should be added that the wording of Art. 5(3)(n) InfoSoc
Directive, which refers only to the “communication or making available”
without expressly allowing the digitization that would make them possible,
has not helped.

Being prevented from using the exemption, Italian libraries have, thus far,
relied almost entirely on subscription services sometimes covering both on-
site and remote consultation.

Generally speaking, publishers have been collaborative and, when
requested, have allowed remote access. However, some issues have still
arisen. Firstly, remote access has been made available (frequently, though
not always) with spatial limitations, typically only to registered users
                                        21
connected to the institution’s network (e.g. within the university’s premises
and not from home). Secondly, it has also proved difficult to provide access to
former members of the institution’s staff who continue to collaborate even
after their retirement or to temporary users (e.g. external researchers
participating to specific projects) after the end of their contractual
relationship.



33.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Art. 5(3)(n) InfoSoc Directive should be amended to clearly state that
libraries, museums, and archives can: 1) digitize their collections; 2) make
them available for consultation to their patrons: all of them (if consultation
takes place on-site) or registered users only (if consultation takes place off-
site); 3) who are allowed to use to this end their own devices; and 4) to print
or save excerpts for offline, off-site consultation.

Additionally, it should be clarified that the exception cannot be contracted
out in purchasing or licensing agreements, even if they relate to analog or
digital copies of the work.

main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be

                            3.     E – lending
36.      (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending
(e-lending), including across borders, of books or other materials held in your
collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-
lending), including across borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
libraries to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically,
including across borders?
                                       22
X YES –In Italy, e-lending has so far proved quite unsuccessful. The reason
lies in the widespread, though disputable (see, Case C-128/11 Usedsoft), idea
that digital distribution does not lead to the exhaustion of IP rights in the
distributed copy coupled by the belief that such copies cannot be lent to the
public at the same conditions applicable to loans of tangible copies (i.e.
payment of an equitable remuneration or, in certain special cases, free of
charge: see, Directive 1992/100/EEC). This, in turn, has led to the necessity
of negotiating complicated licensing agreements with publishers and service
providers (or “aggregators”) instead of simply acquiring a certain number of
digital copies for each work and making them temporarily available to the
end users (e.g. through online services or distributing new files that can be
used for a limited period of time). Moreover, publishers and service provider
have been negotiating such agreements from a relatively strong position
which allows them to impose licensing terms that appear quite unreasonable
for several reasons.
Fearing the loss of control over the number of copies being distributed, many
publishers do not licence genuine e-lending rights. Instead, they offer
(directly or through intermediaries) libraries services which, in turn, can be
passed on to end users, allowing them access to a website where the works
are hosted and/or download a copy protected by a DRM. By doing so, they
tend to offer a pay-per-access service which is expensive (too expensive for
many libraries) without being efficient. Firstly, it is the publisher (and not
the library) who decides which books can be “lent”. Accordingly, the
publisher can also exclude some categories of books (e.g. course books,
which are more remunerative if sold in hard copies) including newly
released titles or books which are not faring well on the market. Moreover,
the publisher can use DRMs which do not allow private copying (or do not
leave the user free to copy every part of a book) and other fair uses (e.g. copy
and paste of text and other materials for discussion purposes) or make the
content accessible only through some devices and not others.
If available, genuine licensing agreements are not satisfying either. Despite
the fact that “producing” an additional digital copy of a work entails marginal
costs tending to zero and, as a consequence, “selling” that digital copy
produces growing marginal earnings, publishers tend to apply prices that
are modelled along the lines of those usual in the analogue era, therefore
reproducing in the digital environment is a scarcity which is entirely
artificial. This is also true for e-lending services which are licensed under
conditions that make lending unreasonably expensive despite the same work
simultaneously being available to multiple users. As a consequence, libraries
are forced to keep long waiting lists even if this does not make sense in the
digital era. On top of that, licensing agreements may provide further
limitations that make e-lending even less attractive. They may relate to the
                                        23
characteristics of the digital copies supplied by the publisher, which
frequently do not adopt the most refined and compatible standards (e.g.
ePub) and contain DRMs blocking all or some fair uses (including those
related to people with disabilities).
One last remark relates to the relationship between e-lending and the
preservation of library collections. If one combines the increasing
substitution of the purchase of books and journals with the subscription to
digital information services (see, above answer to Question 28), on the one
hand, is the replacement of consultation and lending services with e-lending
services managed by publishers or aggregators, on the other hand, it
becomes clear that, in the digital age, libraries lose control over their
collections and will be unable to perform their traditional function of
harvesting and preserving works that express our cultural heritage.
 NO
 NO OPINION


37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


Three different approaches could be proposed.

One solution is to build on the concept of digital distribution and apply to
digital copies a regime modelled on property, therefore, allowing the owner
of a digital copy to perform all acts of reproduction which are necessary to
fully enjoy and dispose of that copy. This, in turn, would permit to regulate e-
lending just like its analogue predecessor–namely, providing for equitable
remuneration and, in special cases, exempting some public institutions from
payment. It goes without saying that such freedom would be limited to the
number of copies owned by the library, therefore, leaving room for licensing
agreements if the library needed to overcome such limitation.

Another potential solution could be to introduce a new exemption for e-
lending of digital copies of works provided that the service is offered by a
publicly accessible library (including academic libraries) without any
indirect economic or commercial advantage and subject to the payment of an
equitable remuneration to the relevant categories of rightholders. If fears
arise that such an exemption would run afoul of the three-step test, it could
be added that the number of simultaneous accesses to a single work should
not exceed the number of copies of the same work lawfully acquired by the
library. As a consequence, this solution would also leave some residual space
for voluntary licenses.
                                      24
A far less attractive solution is the recourse to a memorandum of
understandings between representatives of the publishers and
representatives of libraries (or of academic libraries alone, for example)
establishing standard conditions for individual contracts. The experience
made with out of print works, at least in Italy, does not appear encouraging.
However, if this was the only viable option, the memorandum should cover at
least the issue of catalogues that may be lent, the characteristics of digital
goods (format and DRMs) made available to the public, and the requirement
of applying prices affordable for libraries wishing to offer such a service.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).



38.     [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see
in the management of physical and online collections, including providing
access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
There are a lot of differences, some of which have already been mentioned in
the replies to the previous questions. For this issue, two different situations
should be considered: 1) online collections “owned” by a library; 2) online
collections “owned” by publishers or service providers and licensed to a
library.

Managing online collections owned by the institution itself is obviously
easier. However, it is not like dealing with a physical collection because it
poses at least the problems already mentioned in the replies relating to
preservation and archiving, off-premises access, and e-lending.

Things get even more difficult when online collections are owned by
someone else who licences them to the library. In such cases, the first issue
relates to the contractual conditions applied by service providers, who
frequently offer their entire collection and not individual works or
categories of works while charging additional fees for each and every
additional service made available (e.g. document delivery) or simply denying
some of them (e.g. inter-library loans). Another important issue is the
“volatility” of online collections: both their availability and preservation
depends on the existence of the service provider and on the continuing
payment of licensing fees. If one of the two conditions fails, the online
collection vanishes, no matter how much money was invested into it by the
library. Thirdly, management is made difficult by the fact that control on
content, type of files, uses allowed and performed, and the data and statistics
rests solely in the hands of the service provider and not in the hands of the

                                         25
library. Fourthly, libraries would have to perform a lot of back office work as
online services are not always stable.

39.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see
between libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or
public lending and activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance)
consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?
//

                           4.     Mass digitisation
40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage
in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:]
Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the
results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and
collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works
can be accessed across the EU?
X YES – To the best of our knowledge, the 2011 Memorandum of
Understandings on out-of-print works has not been used in Italy, thus far, as
a basis for new initiatives in this field. The only digitization projects
undertaken by Italian institutions in the last years relate to works and
documents that are already out-of-copyright. It is, therefore, impossible to
provide feedback based on this practice.
However, if one were to reason abstractly, there would be problems with this
model. For one thing, Italian law does not provide for extended collective
licensing systems which seem essential for every mass digitization
endeavours that cannot take advantage of an exception to copyright.
Moreover, even if one day, an Italian legislator introduced an extended
collective licensing system for out-of-commerce works, he would not have
jurisdiction over the copyrights granted by other Member States. Therefore,
it seems unlikely that any legislative measure taken at the national level
could resolve the problem of cross-border dissemination of digitized out-of-
commerce works. A system of mutual recognition of extended collective
licenses granted by the collective management organizations of the Member
States should be put in place.

subject-matter for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific
problems resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are
used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

X YES –Problems have arisen as a consequence of three concurrent factors:
1) the inconsistencies within EU law; 2) the lack of effective harmonisation;
and 3) the too restrictive approaches adopted by some national legislators
(e.g. allowing only use of “parts of works” or prohibiting the making
available online of teaching materials). Art. 5(3)(a) InfoSoc Directive is
relatively well conceived, however, it does not apply to software and
databases. Additionally, it has been implemented in very different ways by
national legislators (see Study on the Application of Directive 2001/29/EC on
Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society, commissioned by
the EU Commission and published in 2013, at 368 ff.). This, in turn, leads to a
situation of great legal uncertainty which prevents universities from offering
their courses—including distance learning courses—on a cross-border basis.
  NO
  NO OPINION


43.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Art. 5(3)(a) InfoSoc Directive should be generalized (i.e. applied to all works
and other protected materials including software and databases), clarified
(i.e. allowing the use of an entire work, if and to the extent needed; expressly
                                         27
covering distance learning courses; allowing uses made for teaching and
learning purposes including the use by teachers but also the uses performed
by the students), and made mandatory. It is true that national legislators
could possibly solve some of these problems internally, particularly, those
who have been too wary in implementing the InfoSoc Directive. However, it
seems very unlikely that all, or at least most of them, will reform their laws
any time soon. Accordingly, without action at the EU level, universities and
other educational institutions would not be able to offer their online services
across borders, individually or jointly through partnership agreements.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of
content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
The adoption of open access policies by academic institution across the
world is going to greatly enrich the repertoire of scientific works that can be
accessed and reused freely for educational purposes. As already mentioned
(see, above answer to Question 28), some actions should be taken at the EU
level to remove or prevent potential obstacles. Moreover, free sharing of the
results of publicly funded research projects should become the rule.

There are, however, a few peculiarities. Copyright law can hinder research
activities either by 1) restricting dissemination of copyrighted works or 2)
preventing re-use of copyrighted works. On the one side, researchers may
find it difficult to work on a specific subject without having full access to the
prior art. On the other side, they may be prevented from sharing copyrighted
works with their colleagues, or using protected materials contained in
someone else’s work to buttress their own assertions, or extracting data and
information from existing works or databases. To remove these obstacles to
the greatest possible degree, a number of initiatives should be undertaken.

     NO OPINION


48.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
As to the problems that could be summarized as “access to knowledge”
issues, it seems that a combination of actions at the EU level could be very
helpful. In particular:
1.     Facilitating preservation and archiving (see, above answer to
Question 28);
2.      Making off-site (see, above answer to Question 32a) and e-lending
(see, above answer to Question 36a) services effective;
3.     Protecting and enhancing open access initiatives (see, above answer
to Question 28); and
4.        Enabling mass-digitization (see, above answer to Question 40);
All are actions which would make existing knowledge safe and more
accessible, and would also benefit the researchers.
Some of these actions would also have positive effects on the issue of re-use
of protected materials for research purposes. As open access expands, the
freedom of researchers to share and re-use existing works or datasets will
also grow. At the same time, building huge digital libraries and archives is a
crucial step towards providing researchers with raw data that could be used
for automated big data analysis. Accordingly, it would be unsatisfactory if
text and data mining were not expressly liberalized (see, below answer to
Question 53).

problems resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to

X YES –The Nexa Center for Internet & Society was involved in drafting
Creative Commons international licenses 4.0 (which are applicable to
contents protected by sui generis database right). One major issue has been
represented by text/data/content mining (TDM) works which are licensed
under the CC licence: different TDM methods (e.g. with or without
temporary/permanent reproduction of the initial work), as well as, non-
homogeneous exceptions and limitations regime in the EU (e.g. Member
States may provide exceptions to the reproduction and communication right
for teaching or scientific research purposes, or private copy exceptions)
create uncertainty and differences in the application of the licenses.
 NO
 NO OPINION


54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
In order to assess, if and to, which extent copyright interferes with
text/data/content mining (TDM), we will try to clarify the nature of TDM.

To begin, we make three assumptions:

1.     Texts, contents, and data (objects of TDM) are protected by
copyright: if not, the problem of interference by TDM in copyrights would not
exist;

2.      The final output of TDM is not a “derivative work” or a “substantial
part of the initial DB” (where “work” is the text or content and “DB” the
database object of TDM): if it were, the consent of the original work/DB
rightholder would be required;

3.      The single information and data which are sorted out of TDM are
“public”, in the sense that they are not restricted by other exclusive rights
(e.g. personal information or image rights). This assumption does not mean
that the overall output of TDM cannot be covered and protected by copyright
(e.g. computer-based works) or by DB right.

If these three conditions are met, a few consequences will follow.
First, the typical and normal purpose of TDM is to extract “public”
information and data, that is, contents and ideas (explicit or hidden) which
                                      31
are contained in a work/DB. Copyright does not protect the content and
ideas on which the works are based. Such contents and ideas enclosed in the
work/DB are freely accessible and re-usable by anybody; regardless of the
copyright on such work/DB because copyright only protects the way in
which such contents-ideas are expressed. TDM is the tool to free open
knowledge and create new knowledge buried in copyrighted works/DB.

Second, TDM does not imply exploitation of the work protected by a
copyright: a “TDMiner” does not “consume” the work, nor exploits it
commercially: either to create derivative works or to communicate it to the
public (in the broadest sense). Additionally, a TDM output does not interfere
with a copyright of the initial work/DB (above Assumption #2). The TDM
activities   which    could    formally    violate   copyright    (such    as,
permanent/temporary reproduction of a copy of the work/DB) are ancillary
to legitimate activities of public interest: freeing open knowledge and
creating new knowledge. We may reasonably affirm that such activities do
not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work/DB and do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the copyright holder.

Third, TDM is functional not only to scientific research purposes but also to
businesses, commercial activities, and non-commercial activities. In all such
cases, the above considerations are valid. In all such cases, copyright holders
are not prejudiced.

Reasoning further on the above, we believe that the basic issues to tackle for
TDM are the following:

1.     When TDM requires a copy of the work/DB (temporary or
permanent), it should be clarified that such reproduction does not conflict
with the copyright of the work/DB. Therefore a copyright
exception/limitation should be provided in order to permit TDM without
copyright infringement.

2.       If TDM requires mere access to a copy of the work/DB, as long as the
“TDMiner” has legitimate access to the relevant text, content, and data, then
there is no copyright infringement. An idea reaffirmed by the Open
Knowledge Foundation in the Data Mining Declaration of 1 June 2012 which
states “the right to read is the right to mine”.

3.     There should be an evaluation as to the feasibility and
appropriateness of specific exception/limitation in cases where the output of
TDM is a work/DB derived from the initial work/DB (above Assumption #2
not being valid). Perhaps by restricting the application of the exception to


                                      32
specific cases and purposes (e.g., teaching and scientific research purposes
which are not covered by other exceptions/limitations).

4.      An alternative resolution disputes system (ADR) could be provided
to mediate uncertain situations and balance the different interests (e.g.
between copyright holders and TDMiners). The same ADR system could be
used for other specific situations where a balance between different
interests is required (e.g. orphan works and out-of-print works).

5.     Facilitate access to relevant text, content, and data for TDM purposes
by law (exceptions, limitations, and compulsory licensing schemes) and by
agreement (standard licensing models).

6.      Consider attribution is an open issue: not indispensable, but it may
be an incentive.

7.     Address     technological issues,   platforms,   standards,   and
interoperability including standardized API, server infrastructures,
networks suitable to manage heavy traffic, and digital works repositories
dedicated exclusively to TDM.

55.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its
main elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
As evidenced above, the following explicit provisions could better clarify the
extent and limits of TDM activities and strike a balance between copyright
protection and free knowledge:

1.      Permit temporary/permanent reproduction of the work/DB for the
sole and only purpose of TDM.

2.     Allow creation through TDM of works/DB derived from the initial
work/DB, exclusively for non-commercial purposes, or exclusively for
teaching and scientific research purposes (if not still covered by other
exceptions/limitations).

3.      Provide compulsory access to works/DB for TDM purposes through
controlled repositories.

  NO OPINION


61.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
A suitable user-generated content regulation is one of the most relevant
themes in the modernization of the copyright framework with the digital
environment.
Any user-generated content, any remix, shared by users on Internet, could be
a derivative work proceeding from pre-existing protected works. This means
that theoretically, in the current situation, this massive production of
contents should be specifically and individually authorized and licensed by
each and all of the upstream rightholders.
Otherwise, all this new content could be illegal.
On the other hand, it is evident that all user-generated content without
commercial purposes are beneficial to rightholders because users, by
remixing and sharing, are creating exponential possibilities of dissemination
for protected works. A copious flow of contents in the internet by users
promoting without profit and without harming the normal exploitation,
turns into a great opportunity for copyright owners.
The need to remold the legislative framework concerns user-generated
content with commercial purposes as well. The current, most common,
individual licensing scheme, in which the users have to reach an agreement
with rightholders to get an authorization, seems to be an obstacle for both a
fair remuneration for using protected works and the possibility of creating
new contents from pre-existing works.
In this landscape, the standard licensing practise might not fit either the
needs of rightholders or those of the users.
This problem could be solved with the adoption of two exceptions:


                                        35
         1.     An exception that allows remixing for non-commercial purposes
         without levy.
         2.     An exception that allows remixing for commercial purposes in
         consideration of payment of a levy.
         It is worth mentioning that a non-commercial exception that allows remixing
         for non-commercial purposes has already been adopted in Canada (Section
         29.21 of the Canada Copyright Act).
         62.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its
         main elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
         See above answer to Question 61.

                         III. Private copying and reprography
         64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
         application of the private copying and reprography exceptions 3 in the digital
         environment?
         X YES –Private copying by end users should be permitted without payment of
         a levy.
         The adoption of a legal scheme to provide payment of a levy for private
         copying raises different problems.
         On the one hand, it is perceived negatively by the users who see it as an
         abusive “tax”.
         On the other hand, the jurisprudence of the ECJ (see, Case C-467/08,
         Padawan v. SGAE) has already shown how difficult it could be to discriminate
         between buyers of recording devices or media who are bound to pay the levy
         (e.g. end users) and buyers who are exempted (e.g. undertakings and
         professionals).
         The growing availability of contents that are “born digital” raises the
         question about the opportunity to maintain such a legal scheme: the cases
         where levy for private copying plays a positive role become increasingly less
         important.

    Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.
                                                      36
      Another relevant issue to be clarified at the EU level concerns the third-party
      services provided for facilitating private copy. Private copy exceptions are
      exclusively reserved to natural persons (Art. 5.2b InfoSoc Directive) but this
      does not automatically impede that third parties (natural or legal persons)
      offer services aimed at facilitating the legitimated subject (natural person) to
      enjoy his right and to make his private copy. Legislation of Member States is
      considerably different to this regard: while certain countries explicitly
      prohibit such services (e.g. Italy), others allow them, while in other countries
      the issue is simply controversial. This situation becomes even more
      problematic considering that nowadays digital technologies easily allow the
      provision of “remote private copy” services and that a market of such
      services could develop. We refer, for instance, to digital “remote video
      recording” services: where in some EU countries such services are
      considered legitimate or at least subject to certain conditions, in other
      countries, they seem to be unlawful in any case (e.g. Italy), while in non-EU
      countries (such as Switzerland) commercial remote private copy services are
      available and the national legislation provides the levy for remote private
      copy.
      Such differences and uncertainty in the national legislations seriously affect
      the understanding and confidence of the legal background for both citizens
      (who enjoy the private copy exception) and companies (which are
      authorised to offer their services in certain countries while in others, they
      are not), harm the EU basic principles of freedom to provide
      services/freedom of establishment and prejudice competitively of EU
      companies toward non-EU companies (which are not affected by these
      limitations and may freely provide their services).
      It should be expressly clarified in the EU legislation that provision of third-
      party services aimed at facilitating private copy (remote or on-the-spot) is
      lawful.
         NO
         NO OPINION


      65.      Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm
      to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?4
         YES

 This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private
copying and reprography levies

      content, there is no reason to apply a private copying levy. Rightholders are
      in a position to shape their pricing policy taking into account the possibility
      that users could make private copies from the digital files that they buy.

situation?

the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?




    IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers
72.     [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?
In the online environment: 1) it is impossible to assert the exclusive right for
certain uses of copyrighted material; 2) in other cases, the exclusive right can
be asserted but this generates such transaction costs for licenses that no one
wants; 3) as a result, authors and performers end up not deriving benefits
from the exclusive rights. Therefore, it would be better to introduce licensing
or legal systems of extended collective licensing, giving authors and
performers a non-waivable right to receive a fair compensation (as an
alternative compensation schemes).

73.     Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain
clauses in contracts)?
X YES –It is well-known that in this area there is minimal harmonisation.
In Member States, there are substantial differences between the mechanisms
to transfer rights and the remuneration for such rights.
In this area, the EU should recommend the introduction of 1) some non-
waivable “Termination Rights” (provided by Art. 2 bis of the Term Directive
2006/116/E, as amended by Directive 2011/77/EU) that enables performers
to terminate their transfer and assignment contracts in the event that the
music producer does not exploit the phonogram in question, and should also
be extended to the audiovisual sector; 2) a time span for the producer within
which he has to exercise the rights acquired by the contracts; and 3) rights
for authors and performers to share the profits deriving from any
exploitation of the work.


                                      39
Because online exploitation of works and performances are increasingly
likely to take place cross-border, it would be desirable for the EU to
harmonize a few contractual practises. For example, some contracts obligate
the artist to perform exclusively in the interest of the producer for a set
period of time. However, this exclusivity clause is not counter-balanced by an
obligation of the producer to exploit the work. Finally, considering that the
current situation involves not just the EU territory but also the entire world
(especially where the digital market is concerned), an aspiration to achieve
realistic levels of international harmonisation is necessary to revise the
Berne Convention in order to better adapt to international principles in
digital copyright.

//




                       V. Respect for rights

75.      Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more
efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 YES


X NO –In the foreword to this consultation, we read: “the current measures
seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the
dissemination of digital content on the internet”.
This statement is correct, although the reason for the inefficiency is not so
much in the procedures and the means of enforcement, as in the
incompatibility of the many current rules in the digital ecosystem. Changes
have occurred in the ways of creation, as well as, in the distribution chain.
Similarly, changes have also occurred and are still occurring in the way the
public enjoys works. Without a modernization on the rights granted to
creators or an update to the exclusive rights scattered along the long route of
distribution, no system of protection could ever be effective.
                                      40
If the right to protect is outdated or dysfunctional causing the system to no
longer respond properly to the changing reality, and this problem is not
recognized or addressed by the community, then the protection is likely to
be experienced by users as ineffective and would only led to inevitable
fractures in the already vulnerable relationship between conflicting rights of
different actors.
Based on the many observations made at the "Online Consultation on the
Civil Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights", organized by the
European Commission, March 2013, it became clear that what we need now
is not a new set of enforcement rules, but instead a new system of copyright,
such as a Copyright 2.0., that is more efficient and better-suited to the digital
world. This need should be focused on the rights, the exclusivity, and the
exceptions and limitations that we want and should have to protect works.
On a more specific level, it should be noted that the notion of “copyright
infringement committed with a commercial purpose” does not have a clear
interpretation because of the many different situations that could occur. In
fact, in various models of unlawful diffusion of works, or in their stages of re-
use and remixes, we only sometimes find commercial purposes for the illegal
works involved, usually by those persons or entities offering intermediary
communication services. In these situations, the activities actually stand very
far from direct infringement of an exclusive right. In many situations, in the
beginning, infringement of works are committed by users for non-
commercial purposes but then they begin to generate business and end up
profiting from the diffusion environment of online content. This type of
activity does not clearly amount to outright infringement, and by
suppressing such activities, we could be suppressing creativity. A possible
balancing may be achieved if copyright holders, such as authors, artists, and
performers were given the opportunity to decide how they can take
advantage of the new ways to distribute their works in digital
communication networks. For this reason, we need to change the current
rigid system of copyright by creating different levels of protection including
one where “all rights reserved” does not exist; in order to enable a realistic
and effective safeguard system.
  NO OPINION


76.      In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for
sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers,
advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.)
in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If

                                       41
not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?
The role of intermediaries is a crucial issue on which we should reflect. In
addition, we need to achieve harmonisation in the Single Market. It is
important to note, Internet service providers are key players in the
functioning of the online environment: they play different functions and they
are always essential to the dissemination of contents, providing technical
means, and creating new business models.

In the EU legal framework, intermediaries are recognized as carriers of
fundamental rights, such as the freedom of enterprise and economic
initiative, or the freedom of speech (“Article 10 applies not only to the
content of the information but also to the means of transmission or reception
since any restriction on the means necessarily imposed interferes with the
right to receive and impart information” cfr. Peter Sunde and Fredrik Neij
Kolmisopp vs. Sweden, Application No. 40397/12).

It is readily accepted that the notion of “intermediary” is broadly understood
by the IPRED Directive and by judicial courts to include all persons and
entities "whose services are used by a third party to infringe an intellectual
property right.” This implies that even intermediaries who do not have a
direct contractual relationship or connection with the infringer may be
subjected to IPRED measures provided in the Directive. But the current EU
legal framework, along with the e-commerce Directive, actually only
harmonises certain limitations of liability as it relates to a few internet
service providers and only if certain conditions are satisfied.

In the Italian experience, internet service providers (in particular, access
and hosting services) are almost the exclusive focus in the enforcement
activities of rightholders. In particular, through court granted interin
injunctions or cease-and-desist orders, and in the near future, through
administrative decisions set by the independent authorities (e.g., AGCOM).
These actions are usually undertaken by rightholders resorting to a
procedure that avoids directly involving the infringer, who often is not even
notified by a request for removal or offered the subsequent option to delete
the infringing content.

The involvement of intermediary service providers in the prevention and
suppression of online copyright infringements is certainly necessary, but it is
essential to recognize their fundamental function is to ensure both the
provision of basic services that safeguard the continued flow of free
information in the network, and to the provision of a framework that allows
the internet and e-commerce to develop.
                                      42
Therefore, it is necessary, for the harmonisation of laws, to define with
particular attention to copyright notions such as facilitation, contributory
infringement, and liability limitations of intermediary services used by
users. All of which are essential features for the dissemination of contents on
the Internet.

Even with new forms of enforcement developing, such as the so-called
"follow the money" approach, which involves neutral services such as
payment or advertising systems providers, it is essential to provide
procedural and transparent safeguards in order to preserve the balance
between all the different fundamental rights of the various parties involved
in the dissemination of contents.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right
balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and
other rights such as the protection of private life and protection of personal
data?
X YES –The right to information based in the IPRED Directive (Art. 8)
provides a proper balance between the protection of property rights
(including intellectual property) and the protection of user’s rights
(including privacy and data protection). Moreover, these rights are not
arbitrarily decided by individuals or private entities but instead on a legal
basis by a Court of Law. Conversely, the safeguards of copyright enforcement,
as laid down in Art. 52 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, do not
always seem fully respected in relation to data protection and, sometimes, in
relation to the freedom of speech.
As highlighted in the consultation on the Civil Enforcement of Intellectual
Property Rights, with respect to Art. 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental
Rights, in some Member States, users’ personal data related to accessing and
hosting services are obtained without a Court Order (e.g., in the
Netherlands). In Italy, the National Authority on Communication Networks
(AGCOM) has recently issued a Regulation which entrusts AGCOM with
powers to require access and hosting providers to supply information on
their service users related to online copyright infringements without a legal
trial or a Court Order.
The main problem is access to the identification data and metadata in
connection with copyright infringements. This data, certainly useful in
identifying the infringer, are held by electronic communications services
providers and are regulated by the E-privacy Directive (2002/58/CE) and the
Data Retention Directive (2006/24/CE). The Directive on data retention
compels internet service providers to keep a large amount of user
information that is obviously coveted by copyright holders to identify
                                     43
infringers. Currently, this Directive is under examination before the ECJ in
joined Cases C-293/12 and C- 594/12 to ascertain 1) any other reasons that
may justify the access to such data (because the Directive only mentions
serious crimes), 2) what happens in situations where there is an absence of
law to specifically provide data access to judicial or independent authorities,
and 3) the duty of providing information and transparency towards the
person(s) involved.
For a proper balance between the requirement to protect copyright rights
and the requirement to safeguard users’ fundamental rights, this legislative
framework should be expressly regulated by law. Access to personal data
held by internet service providers should be released for certain conditions:
1) only in cases of specific crime, 2) restricted to intellectual property
infringements when they are massive, committed with a commercial
purpose, are part of a criminal organizations, or are dangerous to the health
or safety of the public; 3) only with a Court Order, or 4) only with the
provision of specific limitations of a use under a full contradictory procedure
of stakeholders.

                  VI. A single EU Copyright Title


78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to
copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
X YES
There are reasons to back the creation of a single EU Copyright Title which
are both short and medium term. A single EU copyright title based on a
regulation relying on Art. 118 TFEU would have immediate advantages in
several regards. In the short term:
1.      EU-wide licensing would be the default rule; but this would not
prevent rightholders or assignees/licensees to agree on more limited
territorial rights at the EU Member State or regional level.
2.     A unique set of limitations and exceptions would avoid the – all too
obvious – outcome that harmonization, which has to leave a minimum of


                                      44
flexibility by way of options, results in greater disharmony than the one
which triggered harmonisation in the first place.
3.    A single EU Copyright Title would bring benefits also in areas such as
DRMs and enforcement (including uniform rules for the liabilities and
immunity of ISPs).
In the medium term, the EU might lead a more ambitious project: to conceive
the single EU Copyright Title as a blueprint for phasing in dual systems for
copyright protection including a Copyright 2.0 intended to enable digital-
networks driven cooperation to create works. As stated earlier, this latter
tool requires exclusivity, albeit in an attenuated, Creative-Commons-like
form. To provide for this dual mode of protection would be the starting point
for a process leading to a Berne II Convention, which the EU has the potential
and prestige to lead at the global level. In this phase, the global registration
system and the default mode for Copyright 2.0 protection should be the first
building blocks towards the establishment of a dual system of copyright
protection.

that this is a longer term project?

                           VII. Other issues
80.     Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal
framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters
should be addressed.
§ 1. COPYRIGHT AND THE NEW SOCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL BASIS OF
CREATIVITY. Any initiative seriously intending to re-cast copyright at the
European level must take into account the extent to which, in the last two
decades or so, the social and technological basis of creation of works,
including music, text, photographs and audiovisual content, has been
transformed.

The time has come to become aware that, in our post-post-industrial age, the
long route which used to lead the work from its creator to the public by
passing through different categories of businesses is gradually being

                                      45
replaced by a short route, which puts in direct contact creators and the
public, and even leads to an increasing overlap between these two
categories. This development may be sketched as follows.

1.1. In the analogue word, it could be taken for granted that the
intermediation of business was necessary to bring works from creators to
markets. In particular, books and records needed to be printed. For this
purpose some kind of “factory” was required, to manufacture what in effect
were fixed, stable, material or – as the expression now goes – “hard” copies of
the work. In turn these hard copies needed to be stored, transported,
distributed, before reaching the shelves where the public would finally find
them. It was difficult for creators to engage in all these steps; and this is why,
as a rule, they preferred to resort to the help and assistance of businesses.
The kind of business which appeared indispensable for this purpose had
features which the last two centuries made familiar. To begin with, it had to
make substantial outlays to figure out whether there was a market for the
work; then again, it had to invest and take large risks for the mass
production of material copies of works and for their distribution; and this, on
a scale which increased in step with the extension of the markets. Publishers,
the movie industry, and record labels are appropriate cases in point. Radio
and TV came in to take care of the so called “secondary” utilization of work.
In all these regards, it certainly can be said that this was quite a long route to
institute a contact between the creator and the public; and that business was
a very valuable, indeed indispensable intermediary to achieve such a goal.
1.2. In the digital environment all this dramatically changed. On the
production side, perfect digital copies often make “factories” of physical,
material copies of works redundant; the same development is now reaching
the movie industry. The distribution side is similar. This is because digital
goods which are distributed through the net are light rather than heavy, and
use up a limited amount of storage space. But even more so because the
technological endowment held by the public at the receiving end has in the
meantime deeply changed. Here we have enormous excess capacity residing
with the public at large at the receiving end; and this excess capacity can be
mobilized to create distributive networks of extraordinary scale, scope, and
effectiveness.

1.3. In this novel context, it would seem that the setting up of a relationship
between creator and business no longer has the same compelling rationale it
used to have in the past. Therefore both the production and distribution
functions migrate from business to the public and there they can rely on
excess resources available at each consumption unit.


                                       46
The scenario is indeed changing. Sharing and peer production enter;
business recedes. As a result, the long route from creators to the public is
becoming much shorter; and this is happening more and more all the time.
Today creators set up their own sites and make books and music directly
accessible to the public therefrom. Currently, user generated content and
social networks are growing exponentially: creators and public are finally
merging into each other.

§ 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR A EU COPYRIGHT AGENDA. What are the
implications of this upheaval for the frame of reference of a EU legislative
agenda in the field of copyright? We can anticipate with some confidence that
also in the future production and distribution of works will continue to
originate from two different segments, the one relying on business and
markets, the other on the production and distribution mode which is based
on decentralized non-market decisions, often referred to as “social sharing”;
that the latter segment, currently encompassing creations which go from the
open content made available by Wikipedia and Flikr, from free music and
pictures to blogs plus the massive volumes of user-generated content
proceeding along the “short route” just sketched out, will exponentially
grow, dwarfing the market segment based on the “long route”; and that the
two components of creativity will not be mutually exclusive but will interact.

This is why any agenda for law-making for the digital environment which
intends to avoid being obsolete at the very moment it is adopted should
today be so designed that, in a not-so-distant future, at least three
requirements are met.

First, the agenda should make room for the step by step incorporation of
rules which are appropriate not only for the long route but also for the short
route.

Second, it should plan for the “peaceful coexistence” of the two sets of rules,
making them mutually compatible in such a way that the continued existence
and specific contribution of the two sectors is maximized.

Third, obstacles inherited by the past which unduly inhibit the emergence of
the short route should be gradually phased out in ways which should
minimize the disruption of the workings of the old route.

§ 3. COPYRIGHT 2.0: INTERESTS AND RULES. Against this background, let us
think for a moment about the set of rules which would appear to be
appropriate, in the medium to long term, to meet the demands of creators
operating along the short route.


                                      47
3.1. The Interests. In the market-based model it was essential for creators
and even more so for businesses to control and restrict access to works, as
the monopoly granted by expansive exclusive rights enabled them to charge
whatever price the market would bear. However, this would not appear to be
the goal of creators currently operating along the short route. The great
majority of them, be it 9 out of 10 or 95 out of 100, do not make a living out of
“sales” of “copies” of their works; they earn their livelihood in another
activity or business and devote a portion – often a very large portion – of
their spare time to creating. In the new paradigm, creation may consist in
contributions based on cooperation, where each novel input is intended to
link with other reciprocal inputs to form a greater unit; it may give the
contributor a bit of extra income, professional credit, recognition or just fun
(or a combination of the three). Even when the creators operating along the
short route are professionally engaged in the creation of works, their
business model usually is based on income flows different from the sale of
copies as such. Thus, it would appear that there is a shift whereby even
singers and songwriters increasingly rely on performances, tours,
endorsements, merchandising and their likes rather than sales of albums
and tracks.

This is the business model which the Grateful Dead pioneered, possibly
taking a clue from open source software and IBM, and is currently expanding
to an increasing number of businesses. A few years ago, Paul Krugmann
made the case that the demise of reliance on income based on “hard” copies
was being generalized and, in doing so, quipped that “in the long run we will
all be the Grateful Dead.” What is important for creators engaged along the
short route is, it would appear, that their work can be disseminated as
widely as possible, on two conditions: first, that the work is correctly
attributed to them, and second, that the creators may, if they so choose,
reserve the right to prevent third parties to make a commercial profit out of
their work unless this is agreed to by the creator herself.

3.2. The Rules. If this is so, then what may currently be needed is a new kind
of copyright, which sometimes is labelled Copyright 2.0. The new system
would have just a few basic features. Old copyright, or Copyright 1.0, would
still be available; but it would have to be claimed for by the creator at the
onset, e.g. by registering in a global copyright Registry. If no registration is
made, Copyright 2.0 would apply; and this would give creators just one right,
the right to attribution. In this model, Copyright 1.0 should survive; and we
may anticipate that this is likely to be resorted to by creators (and
businesses) choosing to operate along the long route. Indeed, the ultimate
goal is not to displace old copyright, which seems to be alive and well in
many situations, but to add to the menu a second possibility, Copyright 2.0,
                                       48
which should be better tailored to the characters of production and
distribution of works prevailing in the current digital environment.

However, creators should opt-in for Copyright 1.0 at the time of the original
release of their work; otherwise the new and more flexible Copyright 2.0
would operate as a default set of provisions. This is why this approach is
sometimes characterized as “Creative Commons by default”. The idea behind
the approach is that the very successful uptake of Creative Commons licenses
and other copyleft licenses by creators operating along the short route
shows that out there, in the digital prairies and wilderness, there is a very
large number indeed of creators who prefer to reserve only some rights
rather than all rights; and that the time has come for legal systems to
recognize this fact of life by creating a regime in which downstream freedom
is the rule and a system under which creators may have the option to reserve
some rights or, if they like, all the old Copyright 1.0 rights, only if they wish
and say so, by resorting to a global registration mechanism.

§ 4. PLANNING FOR CURRENT FEATURES WHICH FIT THE FUTURE
INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT FOR THE DIGITAL AGE. The defining feature of
smart legislation is that it incorporates in its current components which are
already acceptable today but are designed to fit also in the next stage of
legislative development. Along these lines, the current exercise of recasting
EU copyright law should on the one hand, strive to gain widespread
acceptance and recognition already in the current state of the play and on
the other, lay the ground for a second, more ambitious legislative
development, where EU action in the field of copyright becomes the initiator
of an overall revision of international copyright.

In this perspective, the current exercise should more particularly
incorporate a limited number of features such as:

1.      The phasing in of the machinery for a global digital registration
system;

2.     Updating limitations and exceptions, also in light of the boundaries
between the old and the new and of the goal of contributing to their mutually
advantageous coexistence. A first point should tackle the issue of the
mandatory nature of limitations and exceptions. In the 1886 Berne
Convention, only the right of quotation under Art. 10(1) is clearly
mandatory. Probably the time has come to ask ourselves whether there are
other copyright limitations and exceptions which should be made
mandatory, in the meaning of being dictated rather than enabled, in order to
achieve a certain re-balancing of the expansion of copyright protection and
also in order to provide the wherewithal which may enable the new
                                       49
     paradigm to grow and become robust. We also should ask ourselves whether
     limitations and exceptions should be made mandatory in another meaning of
     the world, that is by provisions which cannot be contracted away; which is
     probably indispensable, taking into account that, while real-world
     transactions did not imply written agreements (you do not need to sign a
     contract to purchase a book), there is no economic transaction going on
     online which is not governed by written terms and conditions, which always
     do away with limitations and exceptions. Another point has to do with DRMs.
     Limitations and exceptions enabled by law should not be disenabled by
     technology. Downstream users should have not only a claim to circumvent
     technological restrictions, but also to have them removed by the entities
     which originally resorted to them. Redress mechanisms, from ADR to class
     actions, should be put in place.

     3.      Special attention and care should be given to infrastructure which is
     used both by works created under the new and the old paradigm. Just to
     make an example, enforcement towards ISPs should take into account the
     impact the possible adverse effects this may have on the emergence and
     diffusion of user generated content and other forms of creation under the
     new paradigm.

     4.     The very welcome idea of introducing a EU-wide, unitary copyright
     should be devised in a way to design it as a blueprint for the future
     international copyright. The time for Berne II has come; and Europe has a
     chance to take once more the lead.
