                 CCC European Copyright Consultation response
                                       
The Creative Coalition Campaign (CCC) is a strategic partnership that brings together rights holders, trade unions and professional bodies across the UK's creative industries. Its membership includes 31 leading organisations in the film, music, publishing, TV, and sport sectors; as well as trade bodies and trade unions. The CCC was formed in August 2009 to represent the rights of the UK's creative sector and press for effective measures to combat online copyright infringement.

The CCC has always campaigned to protect copyright online and to raise awareness of the importance of copyright in incentivising and rewarding investment in creative works. A robust copyright framework is a pre-requisite for incentivising creators to invest their time, energy and (often) money in high quality creative works that are enjoyed by millions of consumers across Europe and support millions of jobs in Europe's creative industries.

We would therefore like to take this opportunity to highlight some key considerations that the Commission must take into account when contemplating and changes to the existing European copyright framework. 

Don't undermine the economic contribution of the creative industries
Recent figures from the UK's Department for Culture, Media and Sport show that the creative industries were worth Pound71.4 billion to the UK economy in 2012, employed 1.68 million people, and exported services worth Pound15.5 billion. This success story is reflected across Europe with a recent study from the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market and the European Patent Office concluding that IP-intensive industries contribute 26 per cent of EU employment and 39 per cent of the EU's collective GDP.

In particular, whilst it is worthwhile reflecting on whether Europe is able to capitalise on the huge opportunities presented by the emergence of the internet, it is important to acknowledge success in this area to date. Consumers across Europe now have more legal access to creative works online than ever before and this is a major factor driving economic activity both in the creative industries and in other sectors such as demand for new consumer electronics devices. 

This economic success has occurred under, and been spurred by, the existing framework of copyright with creators remunerated for the use of their works and investors in creative content able to make a return which can be reinvested in new content. At a time when policy makers across Europe are searching for industries that will lead us to a more sustainable model of economic growth, it would be deeply irresponsible to make any changes to that framework that undermine one of Europe's great economic success stories. 

Ensure continued respect for the rights of creators online
The CCC has always campaigned for more effective measures to tackle online copyright infringement to ensure the creative industries are able to reach their maximum potential for delivering jobs and growth. Some very encouraging progress has been made on this front in the UK in recent years with support from the police, the advertising and payment processing industries and recognition of the problem by Government. Successfully addressing this problem will provide a boost to legal digital services for creative works, enabling further roll out of such services across Europe and further boosting growth and jobs.

However, it is critical to avoid any changes that could undermine efforts to protect the rights of creators to monetise creative works online. Specifically, worries have been expressed by the creative community in the UK that unnecessary and loosely drafted new exceptions to copyright could undermine efforts to enforce copyright online. 

Copyright exceptions should only be introduced to meet well defined public policy objectives that are not already being delivered by the market and should always comply with the Berne three step test. The current European framework already provides flexibility for member states to implement exceptions to copyright in these well defined circumstances and there is no evidence that further change in this area is needed.

Copyright supports a single digital market
It is important to understand that copyright is an enabler of the digital single market, not an impediment to it. The current system offers rights holders the flexibility to offer pan-European licenses where this makes commercial sense, such as for music services like Spotify or Deezer, and to license on a territory specific basis when this is more appropriate as often happens in the sport and audio-visual sectors.

Licensing on a territorial basis occurs for several reasons unrelated to copyright. For instance, territorial licensing enables the tailoring of services to cultural differences and differing consumer tastes across Europe at a cost that makes such services viable. Mandating pan-European licensing would undermine this flexibility and increase the costs of rights in sectors such as audio-visual and sport, making some existing deals unviable and ultimately leading to a reduction in the level of quality content being produced. This is not in the interests of consumers or creators of content.

Encouraging more legal online content services will best be achieved by working towards industry-led solutions under the current framework. Many online services are launched on a territory by territory basis for reasons totally unrelated to copyright such as the need to invest resources, understanding different languages, content regulation regimes and IT infrastructures. One obvious way to support increased roll out of such services is to take more effective steps to tackle online copyright infringement which undermines the incentive for investors to invest in such services.

The current copyright regime provides flexibility and an incentive to invest in multiple markets to those who create high quality content in multiple sectors across Europe. The only way to ensure more legal online services are rolled out across Europe on a sustainable basis is to allow industry-led solutions to be developed under the current flexible framework.

Follow a thorough, evidence-based process
The UK Government has spent nearly four years considering options for reform to the copyright regime domestically and has still not announced its final proposals in key areas such as changes to copyright exceptions. This process has been characterised by a casual approach to evidence presented in favour of the case for reform, with estimates for the benefits of key reforms downgraded by an average of 98 per cent from Pound26 billion over ten years to Pound500 million.

There are two key lessons that the Commission should take from the process in the UK. Firstly, a thorough evidence-based approach must be taken which fully recognises the existing value of the creative industries and carefully considers any potential negative effects on this sector. It must also avoid inflating the case for growth and innovation from weakening the copyright system as happened in the UK  -  the drastic reductions in such economic estimates in the UK expose these assumptions as an urban myth.

The EU process should also be conducted over a timescale that allows for these issues to be fully explored to avoid any unintended consequences. The UK Government has spent four years considering these issues within the existing framework. The Commission's stated intention to publish proposals as soon as March this year is a worryingly short time in which to fully consider the importance and potential impact of these issues. 

This is particularly the case given that, by the end of the year, there will be both a new Commission and a new European Parliament in place. It is critical that the copyright framework, which has been and can continue to be an engine for growth in Europe, is not undermined due to a truncated reform process driven by political considerations.

Ensure a sustainable system for creative works online
In conclusion, the current European copyright framework has been a fantastic engine for growth in the creative industries and for the broader economy. This system provides the incentive that rewards creative endeavour (often undertaken at considerable risk), allows sufficient flexibility for multiple business models to thrive and protects the rights of creators to ensure a sustainable flow of high quality creative works whether films, books, music, TV programmes or computer games.

Without these key elements it is not possible to build a sustainable system that will ensure the creative eco-system works for creators and consumers in the long term. It is critical that whatever emerges from the Commission's current proposals places the interests of creators and the millions of workers whose livelihoods depend on the creative industries at its heart.
