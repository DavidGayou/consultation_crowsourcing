    I.     Introduction
A. Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere
in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem f
rom the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights in different
territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements between right holders and distributors
and/or between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of some of the problems
(denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to
access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)


X NO
First, it has to be recalled that national offers (especially in the audiovisual area) are plentiful. This
question is phrased in a one-sided manner, pre-supposing that there are no means currently available
to access content across borders – when in fact, there are a variety of ways such as the electronic-sell-
through market, as well as situations where local operators provide content portability for subscribers to
watch their content on mobile devices regardless of their location. See also “Licenses for Europe” WG1
pledge of audiovisual industry representatives to continue to develop cross-border portability of
subscription services. The biggest obstacle at this time to the digital single market is in fact the absence
of sufficient demand to incentivize distributors to provide commercially viable pan-EU services for all
content. As a matter of fact, nothing in the EU copyright acquis precludes audiovisual licensors and
licensees to agree on viable licensing terms, be it on a linguistic, territorial, multi-country, pan-European
or even global basis. But consumers overwhelmingly favor nationally based services, and those from
linguistically and culturally similar countries. This is empirically demonstrated by the experience with
cable and satellite television, for example.
     NO OPINION


2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking to
provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
The actual demand is very rare especially if one sets aside the matter of linguistically connected countries/regions
(see above response to Q.1).
Content owners seek to ensure that their works are made available to consumers in a way that is most
responsive to market needs and capacities. At present, this tends to take place primarily on a territorial basis, due
to cultural/language, regulatory and structural realities – not to mention demand. And especially as far as
European works are concerned, one has to bear in mind that said works are mainly financed by national-oriented
broadcasters and platforms.
The current legal framework enables the content sector to distribute their works on a multi-territorial basis, but it
also enables them to respect important market factors such as demands of localization, territorial exclusivity for
those who significantly co-finance the production of the work, and cultural diversity (see also below response to
Q.5).


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
We are not aware of any problems having occurred (other than possible disagreements on the level of
remuneration in exchange for the rights granted, as may be in any negotiation). At the same time, it is in the
genuine interest of rightholders to know of any such problems: rightholders are in the business of providing
access, not of creating problems to access, and problems with access mean in principle less revenues for
rightholders.


5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?


  YES – Please explain by giving examples
While the approaches of individual licensors will obviously vary, there are objective reasons for territorial licensing
(see also above response to Q.3). One is that it is most responsive to addressing local consumer demand which
tends towards a preference for local and non-EU content, with language playing a role and due to cultural
differences and consumer preferences. Another is that market and regulatory conditions vary from country to
country, de-facto imposing territorial licensing in certain circumstances or dictating release schedules that may
vary from country to country. For certain types of audiovisual content, production models are built around joint
ventures (co-productions or co-financings) which rely for a substantial proportion of the financing on territorial
splits of the rights amongst the partners. Consequently, in exchange for assuming part of the risk of production, a

                                                                                                                     9
local financing partner often acquires exclusive rights to license or distribute a film in a particular territory and/or
language, but not others. These territorial splits would be substantially de-valued, would their exclusivity be taken
away. The local distributor, often a co-financer would then have to face another factor threatening the recoupment
of his investment if its content was accessed by the national consumer through any means in another country
before the national release. Without the practice of co-productions/co-financings, production levels for European
works would drop precipitously, unless the EU or the member states stepped in with additional direct financing
support. Thus, a non-differentiated and quasi imposed « single audiovisual market » would come at the high price
of a the loss of cultural diversity, which protection the European Union is aiming for in its Treaty.
     NO
     NO OPINION


6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why,
even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
            – Please explain by giving examples




7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
     YES – Please explain


X NO – Please explain
No further measures are needed in terms of the copyright related acquis. The current legislative framework
provides the necessary foundation for cross-border availability of services and in fact cross border licensing
exists. It permits licensing of content territorially, or on cross-border or even pan-EU bases and is not an obstacle
per se. We would like to stress in this regard that the European single internal market is about the freedom to
provide services, not about an obligation16. Thus service provider which chose to provide cross-border services
are free to do so already under the existing acquis. Instances do exist where it may make sense commercially for
a digital service provider to do so.

B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC17 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software18 and databases19.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders20 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies21, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks22. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1. The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public23. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online

17
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection

20
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
21
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).

country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,

8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
X YES
The scope of the making available in cross-border situations is sufficiently clear – particularly in light of recent
jurisprudence of the CJEU. This jurisprudence confirms that this right is intended to be broad, durable, flexible
and adaptable to technological development.
The exclusive right of “making available”, as established by the WIPO Copyright Treaty and implemented in the
EU by the 2001 Copyright Directive, extends to the offering to the public of a work for individualized streaming or
downloading as well as the actual transmission of a work to members of the public – from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them, irrespective of the technical means used for making available. The very nature of the
making available right for copyright works is such that it takes place both where the offer is made and where it is
capable of being accessed by consumers. This is a reflection of the interactive nature of the right. This is
important not only to the licensing of content but also to determining the jurisdiction and/or the applicable law for
rightholders to enforce their rights against infringers and online intermediaries (see below our response to
question 9).
Overall, the indeed perceived “elasticity” of the right has enhanced the development of new on-demand services
beyond what was known in 1996 when WCT was concluded. This is a right intended to accommodate
technological change and accordingly must retain some degree of flexibility.


   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach24)


     NO OPINION


9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of
the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether
you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred
your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
availability of injunctive relief25)?
X YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
Should a “clarification” notably be seen as implementing more broadly a “country of origin” principle as suggested
by the consultation document (see footnote 23), this would be in contradiction with general principles of copyright
(which ensure as of today an appropriate recognition of rights) and the objective to safeguard a high level of
protection for rightholders.


24
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
25
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

As a general rule of copyright, it is the law of the country of destination that applies to the exploitation of rights.
This rule (close to what is above described as "targeting" approach) is also enshrined in international
conventions. This principle has an effect on the scope of the rights and any applicable exceptions; on the rules
regarding the transfer of rights; on the status of the rightholder (as a beneficiary of protection, e.g., as author or
co-author); on collective rights management; and on the enforcement of the rights.
The principle of the country of destination is valid, and no clarification is needed. It has to be maintained. In the
audiovisual sector, this principle is applied without prejudice of international private law and contractual
agreements.
The country of origin principle, on the other hand, does not apply to copyright, and this has been recognised by
the relevant Directives (e.g., the Services Directive). If it were applied to copyright, this would not only be in
contradiction to international law, but it would also create serious imbalances: due to the different
interpretation/application of limitations/exceptions and differences in enforcement and transfers/contract law in
Member States, applying the country of origin principle to copyright would lead to a "race to the bottom". "Making
available" services would originate in the Member States with the lowest level of protection and the lowest
revenues for rightholders. This would be in contradiction to the explicitly declared objective of the acquis
communautaire, in particular Directive 2001/29, which is to safeguard a high level of protection for rightholders.
The only area in copyright where such “country of origin” principle has been introduced (see article 1.2.b of
Directive 93/83/EEC (“La communication au public par satellite a lieu uniquement dans l'État membre dans
lequel, sous le contrôle et la responsabilité de l'organisme de radiodiffusion, les signaux porteurs de programmes
sont introduits dans une chaîne ininterrompue de communication conduisant au satellite et revenant vers la
terre”) has not proven to facilitate clarification of rights and/or paneuropean broadcasting of copyright protected
content (especially for European works), and it is only when the « country of destination » principle was
reintroduced (through conditional access systems and encryption of the satellite signals) that the satellite market
in Europe (mainly based on local-demand oriented satellite platforms) really took off.

2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")


X NO
In many goods and services protected by copyright (CDs, DVDs, films, broadcasting) rights of several different
rightholders subsist. This has never caused any problems due to the (presumed or negotiated) transfer of rights
and their bundling, often in the hands of the producer or publisher. In addition, where rights cannot be
administered by rightholders themselves, usually collecting societies as their trustees are in charge of the
management of rights. In any case, rightholders tend to organise themselves in order to provide users with a

                                                                                                                   13
“one-stop-shop” for the use of rights (or at least categories of rights), and this also holds true for the digital/on-line
environment.
A legislative intervention which would operate to limit the scope of the making available and/or reproduction rights
and thereby hinder the ability of audio-visual producer to license their works would also raise issues with the EU’s
obligations under international copyright norms. In addition to the potential violation of the fundamental right
protected under Article 17(2) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms ( “Intellectual property shall
be protected”), international rules are also relevant to either wholesale abolition or curtailment of an exclusive
right protected by international copyright treaties. In this regard, the provisions establishing the making available
and reproduction rights in the WCT, the TRIPs Agreement and Berne Convention collectively would prohibit
contracting parties from suspending protection for acts of exploitation subject to these exclusive rights – unless of
course they can be justified pursuant to the three-step test (see Berne Article 9, TRIPs Article 13 and WCT Article
10) or other provisions (e.g., Article 11bis(2) which is not relevant to making available or reproduction), quod non.

3. Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU26 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU27 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
X YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
A work or other subject matter protected by copyright can only be published with the authorisation of the
rightholder. Only if the rightholder has agreed to the publication and availability of the work on-line and has not
reserved his/her rights, the provision of a hyperlink leading to the work requires no separate authorisation by the
rightholder. In all other cases, an authorisation of the rightholder should be required for the provision of the
hyperlink.
The importance that hyperlinking plays with regard to content delivery online means that a broad exclusion from
copyright would not only undermine basic licensing scenarios online but it would also seriously hinder the ability
of rightholders to fight copyright infringement online.
CJEU case law provides a workable and detailed “manual” for answering fact-specific questions related to when
and under what circumstances linking or indeed other technical operations online amount to a communication to
the public. As a result, we take the position that further legislative action is not needed in this area. It is vital that
the Courts retain the possibility to respond to specific fact patterns. In this area, any legislation that attempted to
establish a specific or rigid rule as to whether a particular technical operation online would necessarily amount to

a communication to the public or not risks being outdated quickly and could remove the ability for the courts to
consider the specific circumstances of a given case. The complexities of online copyright infringement are such
that this could have the unintended effect to hindering enforcement – or indeed forms of licensing which operate
by means of linking (indeed licenses would no longer be relevant).
The Judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) of 13th February 2014 in the Svensson Case (C- 466/12)
states that (Recital 20)"….the provision of clickable links to protected works must be considered to be ‘making
available’ and, therefore, an ‘act of communication’, within the meaning of that provision".
It specifies that (Recital 27) " In those circumstances, it must be held that, where all the users of another site to
whom the works at issue have been communicated by means of a clickable link could access those works directly
on the site on which they were initially communicated, without the involvement of the manager of that other site,
the users of the site managed by the latter must be deemed to be potential recipients of the initial communication
and, therefore, as being part of the public taken into account by the copyright holders when they authorized the
initial communication".
The Judgment then states that (Recital 31) "On the other hand, where a clickable link makes it possible for users
of the site on which that link appears to circumvent restrictions put in place by the site on which the protected
work appears in order to restrict public access to that work to the latter site’s subscribers only, and the link
accordingly constitutes an intervention without which those users would not be able to access the works
transmitted, all those users must be deemed to be a new public, which was not taken into account by the
copyright holders when they authorized the initial communication, and accordingly the holders’ authorization is
required for such a communication to the public. This is the case, in particular, where the work is no longer
available to the public on the site on which it was initially communicated or where it is henceforth available on that
site only to a restricted public, while being accessible on another Internet site without the copyright holders’
authorization".
This means in particular that the link to content that is made available without the consent of the copyright holder
(e.g. via a sharing site) or is made available through a restricted access (such as, for example, via Netflix) is likely
to constitute an infringement of copyright.


   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a
work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
X YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
A work or other subject matter protected by copyright can only be published with the authorisation of the
rightholder. Only if the rightholder has agreed to the publication and availability of the work on a web-page and
has not reserved his/her rights, its temporary reproduction in the computer (on the screen and in the cache
memory) requires no separate authorisation by the rightholder. In all other cases, an authorisation of the
rightholder is required for such acts of reproduction.
As a general matter, the exclusive right of reproduction in Article 2 of the Copyright Directive extends to
temporary reproductions. Beyond the actual text of that provision, the Court of Justice has already confirmed this

point (see e.g., FAPL). Subject to the provisions of the Article 5(1) itself and CJEU’s jurisprudence, national
courts should retain the possibility to consider specific circumstances to determine for example whether or not the
exception for certain temporary copies in Article 5(1) is applicable. There may be cases where the copies on the
screen or in the cache memory are fully covered by Article 5(1). However, in the event those copies are from
illegal sources or whose purpose is to enable an unlawful use (see Article 5(1)(b)) the exception may not apply.
This can be crucial to the application of Article 8(3) where it may be necessary to show that a third party is using
an intermediary’s service to infringe copyright in order to secure injunctive relief. The Court of Justice has already
shown it is fully capable of providing guidance as to when Article 5(1) applies and we would expect it will continue
to do so. It is also worth recalling that Article 5(1) is a mandatory exception. It therefore represents a fully
harmonised provision already somewhat bolstered by CJEU jurisprudence.

4. Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)28. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)29. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
In legal terms, allowing the resale of previously purchased digital content by law irrespective of the conditions of
the sale agreement would amount to a statutory compulsory license. It would be a severe interference with the
contract and de facto provide for the exhaustion of the right of making available. However, it should be noted that
the principle of exhaustion only applies to the right of distribution, which is related to the distribution of physical
copies only, and not to services, such as the making available and sale on-line. Preventing the rightholder from
prohibiting the resale would, therefore, be contrary to EU Directives (for software, the Computer Programs
Directive 2009/24, under the reserve of the CJEU “Oracle against UsedSoft” jurisprudence, for other works
Directive 2001/29, notably whereas 29 of said directive) and international obligations, in particular the WCT, the
WPPT and the WTO/TRIPs Agreement. It should be noted, in particular, that the list of permitted exceptions
contained in Directive 2001/29 is exhaustive and does not allow for additional exceptions to be introduced on top
of that list. Moreover, such an undue limitation of the right of making available would also be a violation of the so-
called three-steps-test, which applies to all exceptions and limitations to the rights and is included in the
Directives and the above-mentioned international treaties.
In economic terms, allowing an additional making available by law would seriously interfere with the primary
market (e.g., for the on-line making available to the public of films or music). As a consequence, the "first" on-line
making-available would have to become much more expensive for consumers, because the seller (rightholder)
would have to adapt his/her calculation and business model accordingly. Regarding the audiovisual industry,
where the market is organized through “release windows” which enable a much longer life-cycle and already
implement a kind of “second hand” access to audiovisual content organised by rightholders (the lower the price
for consumer, the later the access to audiovisual content), implementing a framework authorizing systematically
the additional making available of previously obtained digital content would actually question the very existence of
said windows, reducing very significantly the rightholders’ revenues (confronted with competition from resale of
“second hand” digital products with same features as new) and questioning the financing of new works.




C. Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute30. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered31.

15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?


30
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
31
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                                   17
A difference should be made here between a system of registration regarding works only (for the purpose of an
easier identification of said works, such as it is the case with ISAN) and a system of registration of rights, and in
the latest case if said rights registration would precondition actual exercise of these rights (which would seem in
such case contrary to international treaties) or not.


X YES
Bearing in mind that copyright protection should not be conditioned to formalities such as previous registration of
works and rights, as provided by International Treaties applicable (notably the Berne Convention), and avoiding
confusion between registration of works (for the purpose of their identification, such as is the case in the
audiovisual sector through ISO’s international standard audiovisual work identifier ISAN) and registration of rights
(for the purpose of identifying the various rightholders, which is a much more complex task, achieved today
through very specific and local rights registries, if any), there seems to be some room (and even a request from
European stakeholders) for a more proactive intervention of the European Commission in order to facilitate the
development of international identifiers in Member States, notably where the audiovisual sector might not be
structured enough to invest in the development of such identifiers.
Although aiming only at the identification of the work itself, and not giving directly information about rights or
rightholders involved, standard identifiers are key for the purpose of digital distribution management and
transparency. They are also meant to be (or become) a single entry point to those databases where information
about rights is stored (CMOs, public registries, rights libraries, etc.): this is especially the case in the audiovisual
sector with ISAN, ISO’s International Standard Audiovisual work Number (see www.isan.org), which is today
already broadly used by European producers’ and authors’ collecting societies.
The need for a more proactive approach on audiovisual identifiers has also been acted during the “Licenses for
Europe” dialogue, which ended notably in WG3 with pledge # 9 about “improving identification and discoverability
of audio-visual content online”, which:
1. Recognizes the essential contribution of internationally recognized standard and interoperable audiovisual
work identifiers to increase the availability of audiovisual content online, by facilitating rights management,
discoverability, and distribution of such content;
2. Recommends the systematic registration of all newly produced audiovisual works with such international
recognized standard audiovisual work identifiers, and calls on stakeholders at Member States and European level
to consider implementing measures facilitating wider use of such identifiers;
3. Calls for studying the possibility of systematic use of an international recognized standard audiovisual work
identifier for all audiovisual and cinematographic works benefitting from support of the Media/Creative Europe
programme;
4. Recommends the full implementation of the interoperability between ISAN and EIDR (see Question 19 below);
5. Calls for further interoperability and increased synergies between said identifiers and rights registries where
these identifiers are used.


X NO
Should on the contrary a European registration system be envisaged as a formality that would condition the
actual exercise of IP rights, there would be immediate opposition on our side, as this would clearly contradict
applicable international treaties, notably the Berne Convention (as stated in the consultation document itself).
It is true that the USA do have a registration system for copyright with several other conditions attached.
However, this system was introduced at the time as a pre-condition for copyright protection and with a view to
determining its initial duration of (then) 28 years after registration. Such a system would have no added value in
Europe, where copyright and neighbouring rights protection starts with the creation/performance/production
(without any conditions of formality applying) and is calculated from the death of the author or the
performance/fixation respectively. And even in the US, the registration requirement no longer applies to non-US
works and subject matter; this as a pre-condition for adhering to the Berne Convention that prohibits any

                                                                                                                    18
formalities.In principle, no system is needed for the identification and licensing of works. All works and subject
matter and their rightholders can rather easily be identified, be it through indications on the product, with the help
of collecting societies, clearing houses or, nowadays, with the help of the internet. Even if there should be a
problem with respect to such identification for orphan works (which has not proven, in the cinematographic sector,
to be an actual issue), a registration system would not help, because it cannot be applied retroactively.


   NO OPINION


16.    What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
A registration system would not provide legal certainty about the copyrightability of the work, the protectability of
the subject matter, the rightholder(s), the transfer of rights, or the duration of protection, because it would only be
of a declaratory nature, and presumably be based on claims only (establishing a copyright office for verification of
the claims would entail high costs and bureaucracy without any clear added value). In any event, legal certainty
about the above-mentioned features can only be provided by the courts.
But on the other hand, as stated in the conclusions of the “Licenses for Europe” exercise (see pledge #9
mentioned above under Q.15), a European policy supporting implementation of international identifiers would
“help to take audio-visual works out of the digital ‘black hole’ and streamline their distribution and discoverability”.
Unlike the idea of a central registry of rights, and as shown by the broad support to the above mentioned pledge,
there is a strong consensus on the need for audiovisual work identifiers as a key milestone to improve
discoverability, rights clearance and distribution of audiovisual works.


17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
Should the consultation on the contrary consider a central registration system for rights, the disadvantages of
such system would be numerous:
(1) No legal certainty. Registration would only reflect claimed protection which is not proven and may not be
upheld in court;
(2) Costs and administrative burden. Registration would necessitate a registration office, hence bureaucracy, and
it would not come for free. This would be a disadvantage particularly for individual authors and SME rightholders,
who would have to pay fees upfront before knowing the success of their work/subject matter on the market; it
would also double-up with costs already implemented by collecting societies and libraries to set up such
databases of rights: it seems therefore more realistic to build on existing local databases which could be inter-
related (or accessed) through common standard and/or interoperable work identifiers such as ISAN in Europe.
 (3) Foreign rightholders would be at a disadvantage: it is technically more difficult for foreigners to meet a
registration requirement, because they are not “sur place” of the registration office, wherever it would be located;
(4) If the registration requirement were to apply to foreign rightholders, it would violate international obligations.
All relevant international copyright conventions include a prohibition of formality requirements and notably
registration – for very good reasons as explained above.
(5) However, if foreign rightholders were to be excluded from its application, it would leave the financial burden
exclusively on domestic rightholders – and it would eventually demonstrate that the registration has no added
value in the first place, because the EU is a huge market for foreign rightholders, in particular from the USA.


18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
                                                                                                                    19
Rightholders, small and big, are in Europe usually on record/registered with their collecting society or professional
organisations. There is no reason for obliging rightholders to an additional registration of their rights, if already
done. But there is a logic to make existing database more easily manageable, accessible and interoperable,
though common indexes or identifiers (see Q. 15 and 16 above and Q.19 below).
In any case would registration (of works only in our approach) have to be on cost-recovery bases exclusively.



D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed32, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database33 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition34 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub35 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
As stated before (see Q. 15-18), we see significant merit in continuing to develop “identification systems” for
audiovisual works such as ISAN, which is an open ISO certified standard that addresses a comprehensive
spectrum of audiovisual work types and versions thereof, being able to allocate a unique identifier to each of
them, is cost effective and able to address both large and small rightholders and volumes of registration, is
interoperable with other identifiers (such as EIDR) and rights registries, notably in Europe (used by CMOs such
as AGICOA, or CISAC member companies).

The Commission is already well aware of the substantial development of ISAN, the International Standard
Audiovisual Number (www.isan.org). It constitutes a very promising response and we are encouraged by the
support of European Union institutions and media players, alongside of course any other similarly geared
interoperable initiatives such as EIDR (http://eidr.org/).

The role of the EU should be to encourage such marketplace solutions to become interoperability norms for rights
database, even if necessary through regulatory intervention in situations where the industry is not structured

32
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

enough to fully implement such standards. Given the risk of discrepancies between Member States in their
respective efforts for standardisation, there should be room here for EU intervention in this area.




E. Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention36 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?

X YES – Please explain
It has been confirmed by the courts and legislators that intellectual property is true property and of equal value as
classical property in tangible goods. And yet, as a compromise, all forms of intellectual property with the
exceptions of trademarks are limited in time, i.e., have a limited duration. This is a compromise and, in the case of
copyright, due to the fact that, at some point in time, cultural goods and services should become part of the public
domain. This point in time has usually come when the cultural value of the works or other subject matter becomes
more important than their economic value.
Many older works have a very long economic life span: recordings of the Beatles or European films like those
from Fritz Lang or Federico Fellini are still doing very well on the market, all the more since digital technology
preserves them much better than before. The duration of copyright protection should, therefore, rather be longer
in the digital environment, not shorter. This was the reasoning behind the recent prolongation of the duration of
the protection of sound recordings at EU level.
On the whole, the current terms are a good and sustainable compromise and have, therefore, been recognised
worldwide in international conventions.
Concerning performers and producers in the audiovisual sector, there is no need to extend the terms of
protection. As the Commission explains in its impact assessment related to the Directive extending the term of
protection for the related rights of music performers and producers, "AV performers and producers are not
considered as their economic and legal structure is significantly different". This concerns their legal status as well
as the assignment and transfers of their rights.

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC37.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law38. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 39, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional40, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")41.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            22
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.



21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
   YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


X NO – Please explain
Rightholders, as well as users and consumers have lived very well with the catalogue of exceptions that has been
shaped by the copyright Directives and implemented in detail by the national laws of Member States. Copyright
protection, much more than industrial property, is based on cultural traditions that have grown over time. Each
Member State applies limitations and exceptions to its own needs. To give an example, exceptions for library use
are not needed in Member States with less or no library infrastructure or use; exceptions for education and
teaching purposes may be more needed in Member States without a functioning network of collecting societies.
Said collecting societies can also help adapting existing exceptions to the actual needs of users (such as it is the
case in France through agreements between CMOs and the Ministry of Education which have actually extended
the scope of the exception).
There is no need to derogate from the principle "as much harmonisation as needed, but as much flexibility for
Member States as possible". Member States are entitled to apply tailor-made solutions to limitations and
exceptions to the rights, i.e., to the balance of rights and interests that is crucial in the area of copyright. It is
obvious that users insist on strong exceptions and preferably on imposing the respective obligations on Member
States via EU law. However, there are only limited cases, where imposing obligatory limitations/exceptions on
Member States is justified against the principle of subsidiarity. One example is Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29.


   NO OPINION

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a
higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
   YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


X NO – Please explain
There is no reason nor is there a justification for such a step. The principle of subsidiarity has to be respected.
The exceptions that are enshrined in the copyright Directives (like the obligatory ones in Directive 2009/24 and in
Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29, or the non-obligatory ones) function well in practice (see above on question 21).
It is very important in this respect and has some harmonisation effect that the list of exceptions contained in
Directive 2001/29 is exhaustive, so that Member States are not allowed to introduce other limitations/exceptions
than the ones listed there.


   NO OPINION

                                                                                                                  23
23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
There is no need to add or remove limitations and exceptions to/from the existing catalogue. The existing
catalogue reflects a good compromise at EU level. It has been accepted and continues to be acceptable by all
parties. It has always been difficult to reach a compromise: particular examples are the exceptions in the
Software Directive 2009/24 for decompilation and back-up copying or the exceptions in Directive 2001/29 for
private copying, on-site consultation or technical copies (Article 5(1)).
EU law hence provides for an appropriate (and exhaustive, see above) framework of limitations and exceptions at
EU level. Any necessary adaptations may be applied by national law within this framework and do not necessitate
EU legislation. The European Court of Justice is the appropriate institution to safeguard compliance of national
law in this respect with EU law.
Modifying the EU framework for such adaptations is neither necessary nor worth the while. Moreover, any
attempts of doing so would only risk opening up Pandora's box, tilting the delicate balance of rights and other
interests enshrined in the Directives, and not respecting the international law obligations of the relevant treaties
(Berne Convention, WCT, WPPT and TRIPs Agreement).



24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
   YES – Please explain why


X NO – Please explain why
Providing Member States with more flexibility on limitations and exceptions is not necessary because, as is rightly
stated in Section III above, they already enjoy a sufficient degree of flexibility; nor would it be appropriate in view
of the functioning of the Internal Market. For this reason, the list limitations/exceptions contained in Directive
2001/29 is exhaustive and does not allow Member States to introduce others.
Providing users with more flexibility would risk modifying the balance of rights and interests enshrined in the
Directives. It would potentially reduce the level of protection, and by consequence risk being in violation of the
Directives and international obligations, notably the three-steps-test (Article 5(5) of Directive 2001/29; Article 10
WCT, Article 16 WPPT).


   NO OPINION

25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
As said before, the EU legal framework on copyright provides Member States and stakeholders with sufficient
flexibility while providing for the necessary degree of harmonisation. When discussing the issue of (more)
flexibility, it should be noted, in particular, that the concept of "fair use" or "fair dealing" is alien to the EU

                                                                                                                   24
Directives and has no basis in international copyright law. The two so-called "Internet Treaties" WCT and WPPT
of 1996 already provide for appropriate solutions for the protection of copyright in the new digital environment and
have deliberately not adopted this concept. In our view, it must not be adopted in EU law, as it is contrary to the
three-steps-test.


26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
   YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


X NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
Territoriality does not constitute a problem regarding the substance of the limitations and exceptions. True, in
theory, limitations and exceptions, as well as the rights that they refer to, are shaped in detail by the national
legislator and apply only within its jurisdiction. In practice, however, there are not too many differences between
Member States in this respect, especially not in the digital environment where basically very similar, if not the
same, limitations and exceptions apply (for example, for technical copies, private use, education and teaching). In
this respect, applying the three-steps-test has had a harmonising effect, too.
Territoriality does not constitute a problem, either, for the management of rights/limitations and exceptions. Many
exceptions, in particular remuneration rights, are centrally managed by collecting societies that have/should have
cross-licensing agreements with sister societies and function as a one-stop-shop for a broad range of repertoire.
Moreover, these societies increasingly manage the rights together with clearing organisations that operate on a
multi-territorial level.
In the event that current exceptions were to apply cross-border, this could lead to the imposition of the respective
exception of one Member State in another – although that Member State may not have implemented the
exception or limitation or may have implemented in a narrower manner. In such a case, the exception in question
would cross the border and “override” the copyright law of the country where protection is sought.
At this stage, the Commission has not presented any evidence or an impact assessment which would justify
extending the reach of exceptions and limitations established at a national level beyond their borders.


   NO OPINION


27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have
cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when
such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
Rights, as well as limitations and exceptions, apply to the relevant acts that are undertaken in the territory of
exploitation. Consequently, equitable remuneration or fair compensation is only due for private copying, public
performance, public lending, etc., if the relevant acts take place in the jurisdiction in question. In the example of
equitable remuneration for private copying, rightholders are not entitled to collect, through their collecting society,
levies for private copying that takes place abroad, i.e., outside the jurisdiction that grants the remuneration rights.
The latter, therefore, have no "cross-border" effect.
At present, such remuneration rights are not granted by the EU Directives: the Directives harmonise these rights
to some extent, but the latter are granted by national law. If, in the future, EU law should grant these rights
directly (e.g., through a Regulation), they would still have to be managed and the remuneration be collected by
the collecting society in charge depending on where the relevant acts take place.




                                                                                                                   25
A. Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving42 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions43. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive44.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1. Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by

JOINT RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS 28 to 31:
We are NOT aware of problems related to the use of the preservation exception for the preservation purposes.
We are deeply committed to the preservation of Europe’s film heritage and to providing access to it for cultural,
educational and research purposes. Collection of films are available by way of legal (mandatory) deposit rules or
under voluntary deposit arrangements with film heritage institutions – where there is a need to preserve these
materials the institutions in question can either rely on the relevant exception or have recourse to the rightholders.
In this regard, we would notably like to draw attention to the framework agreement on voluntary deposit with film
heritage institutions, which FIAPF (International Federation of Film Producers Association) entered into already in
1972, and which was recently updated to take into account the digital environment. We are also fully supportive of
more current endeavours including the work on audiovisual heritage in the context of “Licenses for Europe”
(WG3). We note also the important role of the recently adopted Orphan Works Directive. Indeed, that Directive,
Article 5(2)(c) and national implementations thereof operate on the basis of a clear distinction between, on the
one hand, conditions that are needed to ensure that public bodies entrusted with the public interest missions are
provided with the required legal certainty to fulfil their responsibilities and, on the other hand, processes and
practices that might go beyond these public interest missions. In this context, we recognise archives and film
heritage institutions are interested in embracing digitisation including by digitising their archives, making them
available online and projecting them in digital format in their cinematheques. Such institutions’ activities should
not go beyond their public interest mission of collecting, cataloguing, preserving, restoring and making accessible
for educational, cultural, research or other non-commercial uses cinematographic and other audiovisual works.
Where they do go beyond this mission, then licensing will be relevant as there is a risk of other conflicting with the
normal exploitation of works in the sector. That said, the audiovisual sector is encouraged by the work that
stakeholder platforms, achieve (see above reference to the most recent work of the WG3 of the License for
Europe process), which encourage contractual arrangements between rightholders and users for the
implementation of copyright exceptions, are very useful to further concrete solutions between stakeholders.




2. Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements

                                                                                                                  27
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.

problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to

institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across

and private study?

[Open question]


JOINT RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS 32-35
We have serious concerns about a possible extension of Article 5(3)(n) off the premises of libraries and archives.
We believe such arrangements should be left to licensing (such is already the case for instance in France
regarding the similar situation of Educational institutions’ extranet) so that they can address a host of important
questions including robust means of ensuring that only intended beneficiaries have access and the use of
technological measures to prevent leakage of protected works online. An exception that applied online and
permitted remote access to protected works would risk conflicting with the normal exploitation of works by on-
demand services online.



3. E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different

                                                                                                               28

to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between libraries’
traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such
as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you
encountered?
[Open question]
Depending on the medium, on-line consultation and e-lending may be tantamount to on-line making available. For
example, if films or music are offered for on-line lending, rightholders must enjoy the exclusive right of making
available to safeguard their economic interests. Anything less than the exclusive right would undermine the
commercial benefits of rightholders and their business models of distribution. It would also be a violation of EU
and international law.



4. Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the

                                                                                                             29
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other45. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)46.

40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


X NO – Please explain
Bearing in mind that the concept of “out of commerce work” is hardly applicable to the audiovisual sector
(audiovisual works are not only edited in DVD; they may be unavailable for good reasons according to the
applicable release window; etc.), there is no any evidence that films and other audiovisual content should be
concerned by such legislation.
It would be highly surprising that the results of the 2011 MoU, intended for books and printed material only, and
implemented in French and German law only (resp. in 2012 and 2013), be already extended at European level,
and even to other types of works, without an assessment of the results of said French and German legislations.

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B. Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?

illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
See reply to question 43 above.
As stated also in Q.23 above, collecting societies can authorize such uses or help adapting existing exceptions to
the actual needs of users (such as it is the case in France through agreements between CMOs and the Ministry
of Education which have actually extended the scope of the exception).

A legislative solution at EU level is not needed. In any case, any such solution would have to respect the three-
steps-test and the principle of subsidiarity (see above, on questions 21 et seq.).

C. Research
Directive 2001/29/EC48 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?

is an issue at all, then the real issue is not access, but payment.

D. Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC49 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 50.

The Marrakesh Treaty51 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50. (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?

52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content? How
successful are they?
[Open question]
Framework agreements exist between research institutions and rightholders' associations and are usually
managed through collecting societies. These mechanisms are not reported to have caused any problems. If there
is an issue, it is payment, not access.
With respect to the recent conclusion of the Marrakesh Treaty to facilitate access to works by visually impaired
persons, the European Union's acquis in the area of copyright and related rights appears to already be in
conformity with this new international instrument. Directive 2001/29/EC provides the necessary flexibility to permit
signature and ratification of the treaty by the EU. Consequently, we disagree with the view that new provisions
are necessary at EU level, since it has not been established that existing provisions do not give satisfactory
results in the geographical area concerned.




E. Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics52 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”53. In the context of these discussions,

52
  For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
   YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X NO – Please explain
The right of reproduction is and should remain an exclusive right (to authorise and prohibit). If mining is private
use, or made in the context of other known exceptions (for research, education, etc.), corresponding limitations
apply to the right of reproduction, mostly combined with a right to obtain equitable remuneration. If mining is
considered to be a commercial activity, what is allowed should be subject to an agreement with the rightholder(s).
We oppose an exception for commercial text and data mining.

F. User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs54. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions55.

58. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?

54
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?




X YES – Please explain by giving examples
The problems encountered are twofold:
First there is the re-use of pre-existing audio-visual works or parts thereof for creating and disseminating a
combination or a new derived audio-visual feature on-line without asking rightholders for permission. It is
sometimes difficult to spot such acts and to identify the actors.
Second the problem becomes even bigger when such content is disseminated on-line (i.e. in huge quantities and
to a broad public) through so-called “UGC platforms” (YouTube or Dailymotion for instance), as those platforms
are using the Electronic Commerce Directive provisions on hosting as an umbrella to avoid any real responsibility
in preventing such dissemination.

X YES – Please explain
Comment on (b): works made available on-line usually carry an indication of the rightholders and the rights
preserved. Other descriptive metadata (titles, identifiers,…) can also help (and should be encouraged) so that
enquiries on both can be addressed to the rightholders as indicated and, if needed also, to collecting societies or

(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for
users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing

X YES – Please explain
Comment on (a): First of all, this is not just a problem of remuneration. This type of use/adaptation touches upon
the exclusive rights of authors (rights of adaptation; reproduction; moral rights) and is therefore subject to their
authorisation.
Second, many authors of derived works do not ask the authors of the pre-existing works for their permission, nor
are they ready to pay anything. If the adaptation is private use, collecting societies would manage the rights of
both the authors of the pre-existing works and the authors of the derived works. However, in both cases, they are
faced with an enforcement problem (see responses to Q.58 above and Q.61 below).


     NO – Please explain
     NO OPINION


61.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The problems described above largely relate to enforcement and awareness. Between the author of the pre-
existing work and the author of the derived work, notice and take down (Article 8(3) of Directive 2001(3)) is an
option, but this requires cooperation of the intermediaries.


62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements?
Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
We take the view that there are no problems that require a legislative solution. The industry, however, is
undertaking several approaches to work across sectors to develop service and technology while at the same time
protecting copyright.

     IV.       Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying56. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain

56
     Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                                                38
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5758.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the
private copying and reprography exceptions59 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain


X NO – Please explain
The relevant provisions on these exceptions are contained in the Directive 2001/29. They are sufficiently clear
while leaving enough flexibility to Member States. In particular, the interface of these exceptions with the
protection and use of technical protection measures and the fact that the exceptions apply to the evolving digital
environment are addressed and well explained in several Recitals of the above-mentioned Directive.
The scope and application of these exceptions also take due account of the principle of subsidiarity and have not
led to problems in practice (apart from the constant complaints of some parts of the industry about the levies, but
this is a separate issue, see below).


     NO OPINION


65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?60

This question seems to confuse several issues, and doesn’t take into account recent CJEU jurisprudence
regarding private copy and reprography which contradicts Mr Vitorino’s recommendations on which the
questionnaire has been based.

   This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                                39
State where a private copy exception has been implemented in national law, pursuant to the CJEU “VG Wort”
jurisprudence), they should be subject to the payment of levies.
Furthermore, whether such private copying causes any harm or not, is irrelevant (and, in this respect, the
introduction to this Section IV, based on Mr Vitorino’s opinion that such copies should necessarily be considered
as outside the scope of private copy, and in all cases as harmless, is misleading): Member States have not
introduced levies to compensate rightholders for any "harm" (although recitals 35 and 38 of 2001/29/CE
Copyright Directive indicate that “harm” can be one of the criteria that can be used to assess the level of
remuneration), but to provide rightholders with an "equitable remuneration" as a fair share of the economic
success of their works in the market and the economic benefits business draws from it through offering the
necessary copying devices. Although recital 35 of the Copyright Directive includes a so-called “de minimis” clause
(but which is not mandatory), the CJEU has also reaffirmed in its “Padawan” ruling that the simple potential use of
a product for private copy purposes was enough to justify corresponding remuneration.
In accordance with art. 5.2.b of the Copyright Directive and CJEU’s “VG Wort” ruling, it is therefore up to each
Member State to decide to introduce (or not) a private copy exception in its national law. If so, compensation has
to be provided for, and any act of private copy, including those made by users for private purposes in the context
of a service licensed by rightholders, should give rise to remuneration.

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
By definition, levies already apply under Member States' legislation to all recordings/storage devices that allow for
private copies to be made. It is not relevant in this respect if business models are "old" or "new". As levies are
about sharing the economic benefit, fairness and economic justice can only be achieved if all producers/providers
of such recording/storage devices are treated alike in this respect. This corresponds to the underlying rationale
that rightholders are entitled to their share of the economic gains made on the basis of their protected works and
subject matter, irrespective of whether the business models are "old" or "new".
Reversely, there is no any evidence that existing levies are a barrier to the development of new products and/or
on-line services, as there is no discrepancy in the development of such products or services between Member
States where a private copy legislation exists and is implemented, and Member States where no exception or
remuneration is implemented.


67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?61
X YES – Please explain
For the sake of transparency, consumers are entitled to know how much of the product/services price is due to
copyright levies. With the same logic, cable distributors usually indicate explicitly the copyright fees in their bills to
customers. When the levies were introduced for the first time in Germany in the 1960s, initially many producers of
recording equipment indicated the share of the levies on the sales price tag.



61
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                                      40
However, it should not be forgotten that putting a visible price tag to copyright levies will demonstrate how
minimal they are in comparison to the overall retail price of the product or service in question.
The proposal to make the fee visible has been made years ago by rightholder representatives in the 2008-2009
stakeholder dialogue organised by the European Commission. It was one of the only non-controversial points of
the Vitorino report, and it has since then been implemented in French law.
     NO – Please explain
     NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments62.

68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue
levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.


X NO – Please explain
First, the assumption of the questionnaire that differences in tariffs would result in obstacles to the free circulation
of goods and services in the Single Market is highly questionable: private copy levies apply only to goods (and
not services) in the country of destination where the consumer is located (see notably CJEU “Opus” and
“Padawan” rulings). Furthermore, to the contrary of what was stated in the Vitorino report as well as in the present
questionnaire, Member States, be it by law or through contractual arrangements with collecting societies, provide
for legitimate upfront exemption or reimbursement of levies when products eligible to such levies are exported or
used for professional purposes only, said reimbursement schemes being perfectly compatible with EU law as
reaffirmed by the CJEU in its July 11th 2013 “Amazon” ruling.
As regards a cross border transaction that would result in undue levy payment or duplicate payment of the levy,
no such situation is therefore known. Copyright levies are usually collected and administered by collecting
societies that are subject to regulation, including tariff-setting and tariff-transparency obligations, and control by
supervisory authorities and/or the courts/arbitration. By consequence, any occurring problems should be solvable
in cooperation amongst collecting societies.


     NO OPINION

69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

62
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                                    41
[Open question]
As said above under Q.68, and to the contrary of what was stated in the Vitorino report as well as in the present
questionnaire, Member States, be it by law or through contractual arrangements with collecting societies, provide
for legitimate upfront exemption of devices used for professional purposes only, said reimbursement schemes
being perfectly compatible with EU law as reaffirmed by the CJEU in its July 11th 2013 “Amazon” ruling (case C-
521/11).
As one cannot necessarily assume that a product sold to a person other that a natural person will necessarily be
used for purposes other than private copying (see for instance smartphones with integrated MP3/iPod player
purchased by companies for their employees), there will be numerous situations where reimbursement schemes
are the only proper solution to address exemption of professional uses. This does not preclude collecting
societies from upfront exemption in cases where products subject to a levy are sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying.


70. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?
[Open question]
See the reply to question 68 and 69 above.


71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
Although they remain characterised by a high degree of subsidiarity and national specificities, as allowed under
the 2001 Copyright Directive and reaffirmed by CJEU “Padawan” ruling, there are no real issues with the current
functioning of the various levy systems in Europe other than the clear whish of those who pay said levies to
phase them out and ultimately be exempted from their payment. Rightholder organisations on their part have
proven during the various stakeholder dialogues (2008-2009 and then again in 2012) that they were willing to
study ways to make the system more transparent (see notably Q. 67 above about the visible fee) as well as more
understandable for all parties involved (notably by working on a harmonised list of products eligible to such
levies). The remaining issues are up to the negotiation and/or the Member States to be resolved.



     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers63 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract64. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic

63
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
64
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                                              42
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
The starting point always has to be the exclusive right (to authorise and prohibit), as it is the backbone of
copyright/neighbouring rights protection and the bargaining chip for the rightholders vesting them with the
necessary negotiating power to obtain adequate payment.
Where the exclusive right has been reduced by law to the right to obtain an equitable remuneration (e.g., for
private copying, reprography, or public performance), it is most easily administered by collecting societies, with
the understanding that such collecting societies are subject to regulation, including their tariff-setting and the
distribution of revenues.


73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
     YES – Please explain


X NO – Please explain why
There is no need to act at EU level: contracts vary from sector to sector, and so do national rules from one
Member State to another. It does not appear to be necessary to harmonise these rules in any more detail, as no
problems have occurred in practice and the principle of subsidiarity should prevail. Harmonising these rules would
probably also be very difficult, as traditions and the needs as well as the structure of copyright industries differ too
much from Member State to Member State, and finding a common denominator, other than the lowest one,
cannot be expected.
     NO OPINION

74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]
Even if the current rules may have their shortcomings, they seem to work well in practice. If needed, they can
more easily be adapted at national than at EU level, while respecting the general framework of the EU copyright
Directives.



     VI.     Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE65 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has


65
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.

                                                                                                                    43
consulted broadly on this text66. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose67. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure68. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
         – Please explain
     NO – Please explain


X NO OPINION
Break of copyright not only negatively affects rightholders, but also the State and consumers.
The Enforcement Directive (Directive 2004/48/EC) already includes obligations on sanctions and remedies for
intellectual property infringements, though they remain fairly general.

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
Under both the Directive on Copyright in the Information Society 2001/29 (Article 8(3)) and the Enforcement
Directive 2004/48 (Article 11(3)), intermediaries have to respond to claims for injunctive relief. Cooperation of
intermediaries could be fostered by creating permanent coordination bodies and obliging them to provide for
transparency regarding their identity. Moreover, it is crucial that the Commission sees to it that the above-
mentioned provisions on injunctive relief are properly implemented by all Member States (which to our knowledge
is not yet the case).
Obliging intermediaries to engage in monitoring would also be desirable and appropriate, but would require
amendments to the E-Commerce Directive.


77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?


66
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
67
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
68
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                             44
X YES – Please explain
Several provisions and Recitals of the copyright Directives and of the Enforcement Directive already explicitly
enable Member States to ring-fence the protection of private life and personal data. All Member States have
implemented the Directives in due respect of this protection. Moreover, the obligations under these Directives are
handled in practice in a pragmatic manner and have not given rise to problems or complaints in this respect.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
   YES
X NO
(1) There is no need, nor would it be feasible, to impose on all Member States an identical copyright law. In fact,
besides the necessary harmonisation through the copyright acquis communautaire, copyright laws and practice in
Member States vary considerably. There are good reasons for the remaining differences: some Member States
are net importers, some are net exporters of cultural goods protected by copyright and have thus different
economic interests. Languages are different, to begin with; cultural traditions, which are particularly relevant for
copyright protection, differ, too; and each Member State has a genuine interest to protect its own cultural identity
and cultural diversity. For example, the markets for books are very different, and the same is true for film
production. Moreover, there are still significant differences in the concepts of continental European copyright law
as compared with some Member States and the USA. Examples are the different level of protection of moral
rights or the comprehensive copyright concept of countries such as France and Germany, which consider
copyright to be not just a "bundle of rights", but one integral concept of personality-related property.
(2) An important, though not the only, element of copyright protection are rights and limitations/exceptions – and
here, there are several (and justified) differences across the EU for the reasons mentioned above, due to different
markets, traditions and copyright concepts. But rights and limitations/exceptions remain theoretical without
enforcement - and here, differences in Member States with respect to civil procedure and criminal sanctions are
even bigger than with respect to the scope of substantive rights. In addition, the national laws of collecting
societies and of contracts/licenses also form an indispensable part of national copyright protection. Differences in
this area are enormous, with harmonisation not even having started on copyright contract law.
(3) Pursuing the project of a single EU Copyright Title would make no sense without codifying all these elements
of copyright protection at EU level. But including them all in EU legislation would be tantamount to an
overregulation by the EU without a clearly demonstrated need for doing so. Centralising copyright protection in
such a manner would deprive Member States of their required flexibility in a culturally very sensitive sector and
would therefore be an obvious violation of the principle of subsidiarity.


                                                                                                                45
(4) It is true that EU titles have been created in the area of industrial property (trademarks, models and designs,
patents). But they cannot serve as a model for copyright: such industrial property protection is dependent on
registration and other formalities, whereas copyright protection is not, and applying formalities to copyright
protection is even forbidden by international law (see above in the reply to questions 15 et seq.). Therefore,
different from, e.g., trademarks, the rights under a single EU Copyright Title could not be contested or confirmed
by a "European Copyright Office", but would still have to be enforced through and interpreted by national courts.
(5) Finally, creating a single EU Copyright Title would hardly be realistic in procedural terms, as its adoption
would probably require unanimity (Article 115 TFEU). But also on substance, it would not be desirable, because,
in the light of the above, any attempts to agree on a single EU Copyright Title would risk leading to the search for
the (potentially lowest) common denominator.
   NO OPINION
79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]
Not only would this be a "long term project", but for the reasons outlined above it is not worth pursuing in the first
place.



VIII.       Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
