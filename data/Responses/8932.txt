     I.     Introduction

A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content
is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and
produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions
such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access
content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adapt to
new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights,
limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This
consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory
framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural
diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two parallel
tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU
copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table legislative reform
proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue
"Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the practical
solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their progress. Pledges have
been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border portability of services, user-
generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data mining). Taken together, the
Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making the user environment easier in many
different situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact that two groups – user-generated
content and text and data mining – did not reach consensus among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe"
will be also taken into account in the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on issues
identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.: "territoriality in the Internal
Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU
copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while
underpinning its legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013
European Council Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market
requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to modernise
Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of intellectual
property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on the "Green
Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online distribution of
audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided valuable feedback from
stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the territoriality of copyright and
possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination of knowledge,
and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by
stakeholders representing all stages in the value chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers,
and academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green
Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to
the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions
on the Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF:


Name: Music Publishers Association Limited www.mpaonline.org.uk
British Music House, 26 Berners Street, London W1T 3LR
The Music Publishers Association (“MPA”) is a trade association representing and safeguarding the
interests of its members, who are UK music publishing companies. The MPA also owns two collection
societies, the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society Ltd (“MCPS”) which licenses mechanical rights
to music users, collects fees and distributes royalties to its 20 thousand, mostly unpublished, writer
members and 6.5 thousand publisher members who in turn represent tens of thousands of writers;
and Printed Music Licensing Ltd (“PMLL”) which manages a licence, on behalf of over 75 print
publishers, for the copying of printed sheet music in schools and distributes royalties to its members.


Background
Musical works created by UK composers and songwriters and licensed by UK music publishers are the
starting point for a huge variety of business models – both traditional and digital. The music industry has
had to adapt rapidly to meet this demand and inevitably there have been challenges along the way.
Whilst the UK music publishing industry is working hard to deliver practical solutions to these
challenges, we are concerned that plans by national and international governments to review the current
copyright system will destabilise the market and undermine these efforts.
Our industry invests hundreds of millions of Euros into musical culture throughout Europe each year.
This will not continue if there is not a copyright environment which is as strong, if not stronger than the
copyright environment which currently exists.
The current copyright framework has shown itself to be sufficiently flexible to allow for the development
of consumer driven digital business models and also is the key to providing certainty and fair
remuneration to rights holders and creators. The EU must be robust in ensuring that any future
changes to copyright legislation should only occur if it is proven beyond doubt that the creative
industries are not able to deliver a business led licensing solution. Any proposed changes must be
supported by rigorous economic evidence and well-documented proof of a problem which needs to be
solved. We call upon the EU to support the efforts of the creative industries in developing a business led
market rather than pursuing an agenda for change to copyright law. So far the industry has shown it can
meet the challenges it faces in music licensing and we are confident that we can continue to do so
without the need for legislative intervention.
The EU must also continue to pursue initiatives to champion the importance of enforcement of
intellectual property rights in Europe.
Our members believe that the optimal way to address the challenges posed by the exploitation of
content on the internet is to balance the interests of content owners against the interests of those
seeking to exploit the content. The market is proving capable of achieving that balance through
licensing, and if backed by a supportive regime for enforcement of intellectual property rights, we
believe that there is no evidence of a need for copyright legislation to be amended.
The MPA also supports the submissions made by our international trade association ICMP, our national
umbrella organisation UK Music and our domestic collection society PRS for Music as well as that of the
British Copyright Council.

     II.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A.         Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the
market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy a single
protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights in each
Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the territory of the Member
State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a
country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming service, or
by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for each national territory in
which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant a
multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content services can be provided in several Member
States and across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial
licences: the proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate
the delivery of multi-territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder
dialogue “Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability
of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep accessing them when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector
issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue working towards the further development
of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access to,
services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that are made
available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online services are available in
all Member States and consumers face problems when trying to access such services across borders.
In some instances, even if the “same” service is available in all Member States, consumers cannot
access the service across borders (they can only access their “national” service, and if they try to
access the "same" service in another Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their
country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with the clearing
of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements between right holders and
distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of some of the problems
(denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15 to increase the cross-
border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
protection for right holders.

                                                                                                             9
Our members support the concept of the Digital Single Market, and have been working hard, both cross
border and cross sector to deliver practical solutions for end users of creative content. At all times,
however, we are also aware of the cultural sensitivities which exist across the member states.
The UK music publishing industry has adapted rapidly to meet the demand for new services and to date
has successfully licensed a number of online service providers including iTunes, YouTube, Spotify and
Amazon. All of these licences operate on a multi-territory basis. We estimate that these licences
represent in the region of 90% of the value of the market for digital use of musical works.
In the area of print and classical music, we are regularly asked to grant multi-territorial, and very often
global licences. For example:
i) Print right requests (requests to print musical works as sheet music or in books or as digital files for
printing by the end user). This type of request is very frequent and can run to hundreds per year.
ii) Media licences for grand right works, particularly operas (the right to stream and make opera
productions available on-line, to broadcast them, to make them available as cinema presentations and
DVDs). Whilst only a small number of these licences might be granted annually, they are a valuable
source of income to a classical music publisher.
4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
In the very recent “Licences for Europe” dialogues it was recognised that there were no major barriers
for online service providers looking to license rights in musical works on a multi-territory basis.
Multi-territory licensing is an area which is developing rapidly as music companies adapt their business
models away from a point of sale model towards delivering flexible licensing solutions. Evidence of the
success of this migration from physical to digital is the number of multi-territory licensing deals in place
with major online service providers. In the UK, our collection society, PRS for Music has been an
innovator in this field and has licensed over 30 pan European digital music services. No online service
provider who has required a multi-territory licence has been denied one on the basis of territory alone.
PRS for Music has also made much progress in the UK in simplifying licensing for small-scale users (the
introduction of their Limited Online Music Licence - a straightforward one-stop, pre-paid licence targeted
at online start-ups – is one such example). PRS has committed to work closely with collection societies
across Europe to develop similar solutions for users of copyright content in other member states.
In order to support the roll out of flexible multi-territory licensing solutions which address the demands of
the consumer, it is crucial that the copyright industries work together to streamline their back office
functions and data processing. The Global Repertoire Database (“GRD”) will be a central and
authoritative database detailing the ownership of musical works. Separately, collection societies across
Europe are working hard to develop back office “hubs” which will facilitate more efficient data
processing. Back office systems, such as the International Copyright Exchange (“ICE”), also have a role
to play in facilitating multi-territory licensing. We cannot see how legislative intervention would do
anything but disrupt these initiatives which the Commission should be supporting. We would welcome
EU support for the development of these licensing tools which some societies regard as an erosion of
their national powers.
Areas where we are aware of problems for online service providers looking to roll out on a multi-
territorial basis include the lack of reduced VAT for online cultural products and the non-harmonised
system of taxation and accounting standards. It should be noted that digital services are likely to be less
vocal about these issues because by targeting copyright they would hope to reduce their costs.




                                                                                                          10
    5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there
       reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories
       in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions
       on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is
       not possible in certain European countries)?
 YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO
Music publishers are in the business of licensing rights, at a fair price, whenever possible and have
developed flexible and sophisticated licensing solutions for a number of multi-territory online services.
Territorial restrictions on online services are at the discretion of the online service provider, who may
choose to limit their service for a multitude of reasons which may include cultural differences which exist
between different markets, the speed at which they are able to establish relationships with local ISPs,
testing new business models or for financial reasons.
Our members have given examples of large, international services which they have licensed on a multi-
territory basis many months ahead of their launch in individual territories. Reasons given are often due
to cultural sensitivities or securing agreements with local telecoms providers.


 NO OPINION


6.      [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why, even
in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you
would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient
(in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to
access)?
      – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


7.      Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in
the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
 YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO
Legislative intervention is not required. Music publishers strongly support the introduction of the CRM
Directive. Not only will this improve standards of governance and transparency, but it will also set
standards for multi-territory licensing of musical works, to the extent that they are not already in
existence.

                                                                                                        11
In addition it should be noted that the existing copyright framework has in no way hindered the
availability of copyright works for licensing on a multi-territorial basis.
To support and streamline multi-territory licensing the music publishing industry is working hard with
collecting societies to develop systems to make the relationship with our industry easier for the online
service provider (e.g. GRD, Hubs & ICE). These non-legislative measures are industry led and industry
funded and would benefit from the support of EU and national governments to champion their roll out,
rather than have them jeopardised by challenges to copyright.
There is however, a need for the EU to review areas which are regularly reported to cause problems for
online service providers, such as areas of non harmonised fiscal policy. In addition, infringing services
which compete with the business models of licensed services continue to be an enormous problem for
both rights holders and new business entrants. Further legislative intervention and support for the
protection of the interests of rights holders and their licencees is critical to ensuring that these new
businesses can contribute to the growth of the content services in the EU.

B.       Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or
not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital environment is largely
established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related
rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in the online
environment are those relating to the protection of software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which are
essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject
matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or
prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the uploading of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and at the users’ end – e.g. when a
user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e.
the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks 21. These rights are
intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.

certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                                12
1.         The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the upload,
the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of “making available”
takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise
however when the transmission covers several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of
"making available" happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the countries where the content
is potentially accessible? in each of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most
recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion
is the “targeting” of a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant
act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific country when it
directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency specifically
targeted at that group.
8.      Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content
is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
We do not believe that the Commission has shown that there is further need for clarity with regards to
the “making available” right through new legislative measures. Clarity has been given in the past
through various judgements made by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
 NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required (e.g.
as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach23)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO OPINION


9.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the
“making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are
considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or
not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of
injunctive relief24)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
There is no need to clarify the scope of the “making available” right as our rights are bundled and
available to be licensed on a multi-territory basis as and when required.


22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                              13
Injunctive and compensatory relief should always be available to rights holders in the event of
infringement, including against intermediaries.
We are concerned that there is a significant risk that new legislation on this issue, which has not proved
to be necessary, would put rights holders in an increasingly fragile position.

 NO OPINION

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and law) several
reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction
right and the making available right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online use notably
when the two rights are held by different persons/entities.

10.    [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to
a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create
problems for you?
        – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g.
facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of
rights")
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO
In the online environment, in the vast majority of cases, the two separate rights involved in a digital
download are simply bundled together and as such are not visible to the end user. The music industry
is working on many measures to simplify the licensing process through business led solutions – and this
the bundling of rights is one example of such a practice and is in the interests of both rights holders and
end users. Legislative intervention would disrupt the development of these simpler licensing solutions.




3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another. They are
indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are pending before the
CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of a clickable link constitutes an act
of communication to the public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of works and
other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache' memory of his
computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such copies are always covered
by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive
2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected
under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder?
     YES
Whether or not the provision of a hyperlink leading to a copyright work requires the authorisation of the
rightholder depends on the context in which the link is being used and the legitimacy of the site to which
it is linking. If a hyperlink takes a user to a site which is using content without the consent of rights
holders, then the link should be considered to be infringing.
We look forward to further clarification from the courts following judgements to come from cases
currently before the CJEU.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public – or
to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a
work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory
of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES
We believe that his is already addressed by the Copyright Directive in Article 5.1 and as such we see no
requirement for a broadening of this exception.


In addition, it should also be noted, that the viewing of a web page, as described in the circumstances
above, is regularly included in the terms of licensing arrangements negotiated by rights holders – for
example for online music streaming services where the activity could be considered to be ‘browsing’.

4.         Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions
arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling them or
by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in the case of

                                                                                                           15
the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the
right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is
whether this principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to
distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and
using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the “forward and delete”
question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of a second-hand market of copies of
perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

13.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to
resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
This practice is currently illegal under existing copyright laws (c.f. Art 3 (3) Information Society Directive)
and restrictions are therefore in line with current legislation. We are concerned that this question seems
to suggest that this is a legal/acceptable acceptable practice and the question is likely to reinforce this
view amongst respondents.


 YES – Please explain by giving examples
 NO
 NO OPINION


14.    [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences
of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content?
Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]


The music industry has licensed many online service providers who are able to develop flexible and
compelling digital music services to customers at an attractive price point.
The consumption of content by consumers in the digital environment is not comparable with the
purchase of physical content in the analogue world. Digital music files are available to consumers by
way of a licence and not a purchase. As such we do not think it is appropriate to try and mirror business
practices from the physical world in the digital world.
Providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content would be
devastating to the primary market for digital musical works. It would undermine the value of existing
licensing agreements in place with service providers as it would allow users to create perfect copies of
original content which would compete with the primary download. In addition there is no way of
monitoring the dissemination of digital files without the use of expensive and complex technological
protection measures and it would open the door to legitimising piracy.
27
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                               16
C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties in the area
prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights. However, this prohibition is
not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made compulsory or constitute
a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with the
increased opportunities that digital technology provides for the use of content (including older works and
works that otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a
system of registration are increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
 YES
 NO Establishing a compulsory system of registration would go against the requirements of the Berne
Convention, Article 5 (2) which states that copyright should not be subject to any formality. In addition it
would force an unnecessary administrative burden on creators and rights holders.


At the moment creators and rights holders have the choice of registering their works within collective
management organisations. This voluntary system of registration allows rights holders and creators to
be equitably paid for the use of their work, which therefore creates a commercial incentive to register.


The music publishing industry has been working with collecting societies to build the GRD – this
database will provide an authoritative and comprehensive point of reference for the ownership and
control of musical works. The project is well underway and will provide a de facto point of registry. The
EU should be supporting this initiative which will contain accurate information rather than considering a
new, competing database.

None……………………………………………………….

17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
With no commercial incentive to register, such a system would inevitably create a database of
inaccuracies and which would slow down the licensing process whilst at the same time adding cost to

29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             17

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers, collective
management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser
extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed ‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be
compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are specific to the sector in which they have
been developed31, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the
interoperability of such identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once
operational, provide a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works
worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression
and management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types of rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification systems a step
further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across different sectors.

19.     What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content
sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and
permissions databases?
As mentioned in our response to question 15, we believe it would be useful to look at how the EU could
work with the industry to promote the initiatives currently underway to improve efficiency in licensing
such as GRD for the music industry and the Linked Content Coalition.

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time. After the term
of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in
accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention 35 requires a
minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of
protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided for in the
EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements, providing for a
term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual
sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of protection.

20.          Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
 YES There is no discernible reason why the term of protection should be altered in the digital
environment. The term of copyright has been thoroughly reviewed recently and subject to full
consultation by all member states which led to the adoption of the Term Directive in 2011. This was
implemented in the UK on 1 November 2013. The environment for copyright has not changed
sufficiently in the past few months to imagine that it is appropriate to review term of copyright again.
 NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

      III.     Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other protected
subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a
certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher in
a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number of copyright directives, most notably
Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international law 37. In
accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and exceptions can
only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or
other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no other
exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and exceptions are
often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or as
few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions is
general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and
exceptions included in the EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy
terms and in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within
the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the rights is


36
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
37
   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
38
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
39
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.

                                                                                                             19
territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may still require the
authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair compensation of
rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate rightholders for the harm
inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are not
obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering
a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for
illustration in an online course given by an university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a
Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the
level of that compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure
that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that
certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of
rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether a greater degree of flexibility can be
introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal
certainty, including for the functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's international
obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in
the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
…………………………………
…………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain


Our members have not encountered any problems with the current catalogue of limitations and
exceptions. They have been designed to be sufficiently flexible to allow member states to reflect existing
practices and cultural differences.
The majority of the most relevant exceptions have now been adopted by member states and where they
have not been adopted this has been due to cultural practices in that jurisdiction.


 NO OPINION

22.     Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a
higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an

  NO
We see no need for a higher level of harmonisation or for exceptions to be made mandatory in member
states.
The current framework has not hindered the roll out of multi-territory licences in the music industry and
the flexibility of the framework is a perfect way to allow member states to adapt their own framework
which allows for cultural diversity. Market led licensing solutions, coupled with a flexible copyright
framework have addressed the requirements of the majority of end users and consumers.
 NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


We are happy that the current list of exceptions provides the correct balance between market demands
and the rights of creators and rights holders. As they currently stand they have not stopped the roll out
of online music services or stood in the way of consumer access to digital content.
It is also important to note that the current list of exceptions and limitations is in line with the
internationally recognised Three Step Test which only allows exceptions in cases which do not conflict
with the normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the
rights holder.
Calls for additional limitations and exceptions are unlikely to comply with the Three Step Test and are
generally called for by commercial enterprises seeking to avoid paying rights holders and creators for
their content. We are particularly concerned by the proposals for a User Generated Content (“UGC”)
exception. Please see our response to Qs 58 – 63.
If it is the case that additional exceptions and limitations are proposed, their inclusion in the copyright
framework must only be suggested on the basis of robust economic evidence and independent research
with clear, worked examples of how and why the current framework and licensing environment is unable
to adapt to the demands of the marketplace. Exceptions must only be introduced to address market
failure and must not in any way harm existing business practices or diminish returns to creators. We
believe that there is no evidence of market failure.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of
flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
 YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO
We have seen no evidence to suggest this; the music industry has been devastated by piracy but
remains a viable business. This will not be the case if further exceptions and limitations are introduced.
Our concern is that it is very difficult to get some digital services to the negotiating table. Their position
vis-a-vis the content industries is that royalty prices need to be low to enable them to compete with
piracy. It will be impossible to maintain the value of music with further exceptions. The music industry


                                                                                                           21
and European culture will be at risk of further declining revenues which will impact upon investment into
creativity in the region.
The way in which European law has developed in the area of limitations and exceptions is to provide
certainty for rights holders and end users of copyright content whilst maintaining sufficient flexibility for
member states to adapt the law to meet the needs of their own jurisdiction.
Greater flexibility suggests the introduction of a “fair use” concept, which we believe leads to
unacceptable levels of uncertainty for all involved in the licensing of copyright works and to increased
legal costs. Certainly in the US, where the concept of “fair use” exists (supported by over 170 years of
case law), cases still arise regularly questioning the exact scope of the “fair use” exception.
For businesses wishing to establish themselves in Europe based around the use of copyright, we
believe that commercial certainty provided by the existing copyright exceptions and limitations would be
preferable to any “fair use” alternative.
 NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by
national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open
norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages
of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

 YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
In the experience of our members, the territoriality of limitations and exceptions does not constitute a
problem and we have seen no evidence to suggest that it does. As referred to in answers above, it
exists to provide member states with flexibility and to reflect their specific national requirements.



27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have
cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such
compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

In the UK we have no direct experience of the application of “fair compensation”. Our view is that this
issue has been addressed in recent ECJ judgements (Stichting de Thuiskopie v Opus and Austro
Mechana v Amazon) and that the current system works and should be preserved.



                                                                                                          22
A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of limitations and
exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums, as
well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and archiving 41 and enable
on-site consultation of the works and other subject matter in the collections of such institutions 42. The
public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and
other subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives envisaged or
whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions
arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject
matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role of licensing and possible
framework agreements between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of cultural
establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of
fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most
Member States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing for the making of such
preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards
the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the
mode of copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the
current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.
28.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other subject matter
in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by libraries,
educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
 YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

2.      Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-matter
(consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises of such
establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and
other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the premises of the library) requires
authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements between universities/libraries and publishers.
Some argue that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions
for, granting online access to collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide remote
access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of research

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in the

that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across borders, to the works
or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private study?

3.      E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and
DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it technically possible for libraries
to provide users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via networks.
Under the current legal framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to
organise such e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently
experimenting with different business models for the making available of works online, including direct
supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying
to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders,
of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across borders,
from institutions such as public libraries?

them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as libraries and
archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with an objective to preserve
these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public. Examples are efforts by libraries
to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or whole collections of pictures of historical
value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce
works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to
facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements
between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies
representing authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available
online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management
Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some Member
States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting society or the recognition of an
“extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass digitisation
projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your
country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements
concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of
commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

44
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
45
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             26

41.    Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other
types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
 YES –
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain
The MOU on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works signed in
2011 was intended to facilitate agreements in the print sector between parties such as authors,
publishers and libraries on collective licensing schemes for the digitisation and making available by
public institutions of “out of commerce” printed works. The agreement was very specific and sector
driven. We see no case for a similar arrangement regarding music as digitisation is a common feature
and the chances of music being both in analogue form and out of commerce are remote.
 NO OPINION

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation limitations and
exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing copies of
fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected content on a
smart board without having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation of this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementation at Member States level. The
implementation of the exception differs from Member State to Member State, with several Member
States providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some
argue that the law should provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for illustration
for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from
the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for teaching, including
across borders?
 YES – Please explain

44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration
for teaching purposes? How successful are they?


Licensing schools and educational establishments for the copying of copyright material is a long
established model in the UK. In line with this in 2013, the MPA launched its ‘Printed Music Licensing
Scheme’, whereby schools in the UK are able to copy musical works (and make arrangements thereof)
in return for a licence fee. The scheme has been backed by the Department for Education and is
administered by the CLA (Copyright Licensing Agency).
This is an example of a successful, market-led solution and any broadening of an education exception
to override licensing schemes would damage the income stream rights holders receive from schools.
Further information on this scheme can be found here.


45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements?
Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what conditions?

We do not think that any legislative solution is required as there is no evidence of market failure.
Licensing schemes for certain uses of copyright works in schools are well established in the UK. Much
work is currently being undertaken by the UK copyright industries aimed at improving information to
schools and educational establishments on the availability of licensing schemes. Examples of this are
the development of the Copyright Hub and the work of the CLA. Any broadening of this exception would
conflict with the Berne Three Step Test as it would interrupt the normal business of copyright licensing,
such as the Printed Music Licensing scheme we run in the UK.

States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched to increase the accessibility of
works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works
published in special formats and facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons who are
blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to
copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make available accessible
format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and its
Member States have started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain
provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible format copies across
borders).

with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content, including across

The MPA has a Code of Fair Practice and within this there are guidelines relating to the use of printed
music material by disabled persons. The MPA has also developed a licensing scheme under the
Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002. The scheme governs multiple copying of printed music
for the benefit of visually impaired people by educational and not for profit bodies in place of the Act.
Companies who wish to reproduce printed music using Braille or large print formats can do so by
applying for a licence through the MPA rather than having to directly approach MPA member companies
who hold copyright in the music.
The existence of licensing schemes such as this, which are flexible and meet the demands of the end
user, mitigate the requirement for further legislative intervention.

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe increasingly
important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing
texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or other
automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights,
patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible through
subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is
made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories
or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine
protected works or other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for
the making of such copies unless such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general
public without restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining
activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in particular since text
and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in several different
ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue
go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use content) and
relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial
databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe"
stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the
problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and data
mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by publishers as an outcome of
“Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no
additional licences should be required to mine material to which access has been provided through a
subscription agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and data mining should be
introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to copyright,
when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute content at little
to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are developing rapidly, including
the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally original content, they
can also take one or several pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload the result
on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the
modification of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily
require a creative effort and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing
content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
53
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           32
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content widely has
vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic impact for those
holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of a technically and artistically
adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This
in turn raises questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right
to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe"
stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the
problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of
views were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One view was to say that a
new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as
combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available
(licence schemes concluded between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded
between rightholders and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders
across different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

     NO
The music publishing industry was represented in the ‘Licences for Europe’ working group (WG2)
looking at the issue of User Generated Content. As the Commission noted, there was no consensus on
the definition of UGC or what the exact issues were around UGC which the group was trying to address.
The creation of user generated content is undoubtedly an area which will continue to grow in popularity
and be served over a range of digital platforms. The aim of the music industry is to license platforms so
that individual users do not have to secure individual licences. Licensing of UGC is now established in
the UK. Recently our collection society, PRS for Music, concluded a renegotiation of its deal with
YouTube, which will continue to secure a flow of income back to UK songwriters, composers and music
publishers.
Our view is that UGC should be treated no differently to an adaptation or a derivative work as long as it
is correctly licensed. Music Publishers are happy to license derivative works and indeed have a blanket
licences in place with online service providers which ensures that rights holders are remunerated fairly

for their work, without placing any unnecessary burden or legal risk on the end user who is adapting the
content.
That said, it is vital in the realm of adaptation/derivative works/UGC, that the rights holder is able to
exercise their Moral Rights to ensure that their work is not used in a way which is offensive to them. The
enforcement of Moral Rights should not be confused with making it difficult to license UGC, and is easily
dealt with by the provision of “notice or takedown” provisions in UGC licences.

publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)

This market is developing rapidly and the industry is working closely with online service providers to
ensure works are correctly identified for online use. There is no evidence that the introduction of
identifiers by way of expensive and distracting copyright legislation is necessary.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO
Publishers are in the business of licensing rights and as we have said above, the licensing of UGC
content does not differ enormously from existing licensing models which have evolved to deal with
derivative works, adaptation and the well-established market for synchronisation. In addition,

                                                                                                       34
increasingly sophisticated systems for monitoring usage and data mean that rights holders and creators
are able to be remunerated appropriately.


What does concern us, however, is the idea of an exception for UGC, which appears to imply that
creators of UGC will be able to receive remuneration for their work (through advertising for example)
whilst payment of the underlying rights holders whose works have been used will be exempted. This is
not acceptable; both the individual uploading the UGC and the rights holder should be remunerated, as
is currently the case. It is absolutely essential that the creators get rewarded for their works being used.
Any changes to legislation on this issue will deprive the creative industries of a growing and increasingly
important income stream which will reduce the levels of investment in the European creative industries.


61.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
One area where our members have reported problems, and which may fall into the scope of User
Generated Content, is the area of printed music material where there are examples of either user
generated or user uploaded files of scanned sheet music forming the basis of illegal sites such as
PianoFiles.
Sites such as these are having a negative impact on the print music industry and frequently offend
creators. Music publishers are making headway in licensing these services, and are having some
success - for example Ultimate Guitar (user generated guitar tabs) which is a huge file sharing service,
has now been licensed.
An exception for user generated content would potentially legitimise the infringing activity of this type of
site and allow them to compete with licensed service providers. We need enforced, not reduced
protection to deal with such sites.


62.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements?
Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?

63.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
We do not think that a legislative solution is needed. Market led solutions have been developed and are
functioning for the benefit of the consumer, rights holder and online service provider. This is a market
which is expected to deliver significant growth in the coming years and this is essential in a world where
physical sales and other paid for music consumption are declining. Interrupting current licensing activity
with an exception for UGC would undermine the development of this market and have a devastating
effect on our ability to continue to invest in musical/cultural works.

We do believe, however, that there is a place for educating the market about what is a legitimate use of
another’s content and what is not – and signposting towards sites which are licensed and providing
remuneration to rights holders and those which are not. Any help from the EU in supporting the
copyright industries with this initiative would be greatly appreciated (The UK’s Copyright Hub is a good
example of progress being made in this area).

We would be fundamentally opposed to a “fair use” exception for user generated content as it would not
give sufficient clarity to the end user or the rights holder and would be likely to result in costly legal
battles. The EU system currently provides a good balance between legal certainty and flexibility.

      IV.   Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation exceptions or
limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and photocopying55. Levies are
charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording
equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers,
etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made without
their authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private
use) or through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for
rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the copying of
files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an
MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile
phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in
some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by
the service provider already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead
to instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence
fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of cloud-based
services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the
private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
 YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
………………………………………………………………………………………………


     NO
There have been a number of CJEU decisions interpreting the Copyright Directive made over recent
years which have confirmed that in countries where consumers are allowed by law to make private
copies of copyright protected material, that rights holders have the right to be compensated for those
reproductions. This approach was also confirmed by Mr Vitorino in his report on private copying.


Levies compensate the rights holder and creator when licensing is not workable or enforceable. It would
be helpful if there was harmonisation across EU member states relating to which devices attract a
private copying levy, but recognise that harmonisation of tariffs on devices is unrealistic. We support the
position of UK Music and other UK rights holder organisations, that the proposed introduction of a

private copying exception in the UK, without fair compensation to rights holders, is completely
unacceptable and is a major threat to our members’ continued ability to invest in music.


 NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service
that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be
subject to private copying levies?59
     YES
Any copy which is made without remuneration to the rights holder is harmful. Why should a creator or
publisher invest in creation if users can access it for free? Licensing is always our first option, but where
this is not possible, levies are essential.
       – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



66.     How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
rightholders’ revenue on the other?


Online services, such as cloud computing services, should be and are being licensed by our members.
The development of new, licensed business models over recent years is proving that the system of
licensing is working well for service providers and rights holders and would not have been possible if
there had been a copyright environment which supported un-compensated private copying.
There is no evidence that the existence of levies in Europe has interrupted the development of online
services. As previously mentioned in this document, multi-territory licences are in place with online
service providers such as Spotify, Deezer, iTunes, Amazon and levies have not been a hindrance to the
development of these services.
In the UK discussions are on-going as to whether certain (dumb locker) cloud services should be
covered by a private copying exception if they provide no additional functionality. We view this as
impractical as in reality such ‘dumb locker’ services do not exist and will infringe EU law if they are
subject to an exception without fair compensation to rights holders.
67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?60
     YES
In the interests of transparency and accountability this would be useful. It would also ensure no
avoidance of payment and double payment in the case of export.

 NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in obstacles to
the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time, many Member States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all transactions irrespective of
the person to whom the product subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that
context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which
could remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments61

68.    Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue
levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement
of goods or services?
  YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue payments.
Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes could help to
remedy the situation.

 NO
Although there are differences in the way levy tariffs are calculated in different markets, the situation is
well managed. Where problems do occur there is a refund system now in place.




69.    What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions result
in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of products, type of
transaction, stakeholders, etc.).



70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?

The UK Government is currently pushing ahead to introduce a private copying exception without fair
compensation for rights holders by way of introducing a new Section 28B to the CDPA. Our view is that
the UK Government’s plans infringe mandatory European legislation as has been interpreted by the
CJEU in recent years. We note the forthcoming decision on the Copydan case and hope that this will
provide further clarity.

       V.      Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights and, in the
case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few
provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from authors or performers to
producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or other subject matter is
created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an area that has been traditionally left for
Member States to regulate and there are significant differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial
differences also exist between different sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic benefit of new
forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain. Another commonly raised
issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-
out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that
rules at national level do not suffice to improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination of
mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your
works and performances?
Copyright is based on the principle that it enables the creator to be rewarded and provides protection. It
also enables those who support creators to be rewarded for their investment.
Music publishers act on behalf of tens of thousands of songwriters and composers and it is our belief
that all those we represent deserve fair remuneration for their artistic creations. Music publishers can
only invest in their songwriters and composers if there is a strong and fair copyright regime, the ability to
deal swiftly with piracy, and fair remuneration for any validly created copyright exceptions.
Contracts between music publishers and composers/songwriters are freely negotiated and operate at
arms-length. The best protection for writers is the fiercely competitive nature of the music publishing
market and that writers have a huge number of publishers from whom to choose. This means that the
market essentially is self regulating through a combination of both choice and competition.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?

     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of intellectual
property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this
text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions are still fit to ensure a proper
respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to
deal with the new challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other
hand, there are concerns about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the
protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it
cannot be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is
used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of intermediaries in
the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of the safeguards for respect of
private life and data protection for private users.

75.     Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 YES
We believe that in order for there to be a level playing field which is able to allow licensed services to
respond to the demands of the consumer and whilst ensuring the creator is appropriately remunerated,
that there needs to be a far greater focus at the EU level on the enforcement of intellectual property
rights.
This is an area where we would appreciate some clarity at an EU level and we would suggest the
following improvements could be made to support efforts in this area:
i) It could be useful to establish a set of clear rules for fast track proceedings for civil law cases
concerning infringements and EU guidelines for the calculation of damages. In UK Law the question of
how to calculate damages in relation to infringement is assessed by addressing the question as to what
would be a reasonable licence fee had the use been properly licensed? This has worked well for many
years and is essentially an exercise in comparison with similar licensed exploitation and a similar
formula could be used in addressing the question of fair compensation across borders.

64
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
65
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
66
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
67
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           40
ii) The provisions on injunctions and damages should also be harmonised between all EU member
states as there is currently great inconsistency.
We do not think it is appropriate to distinguish between commercial and non-commercial purposes as
often the financial gains made from piracy are substantial but difficult to quantify accurately.


 NO – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO OPINION

76.     In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment
service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with
a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?


The “Mere Conduit” and “Hosting” exceptions were intended to protect service providers and website
operators from liability in circumstances where their services were being used to infringe copyright
without their knowledge or consent. That is a legitimate aim. However, due to their broad drafting they
have been interpreted far more widely and they both need to be re-drawn so as to be limited to that
specific purpose. Furthermore, the remedy available to rights owners (once the host or service provider
is on notice of infringement) is limited to injunctive relief requiring them to remove or block the infringing
material. This of course addresses future damage although it would be far more effective if an injunction
obtained in the court of a Member State were to have automatic pan-European direct effect.
However, there is no reason why disregard of notice by an ISP or Host (which currently triggers the right
to injunctive relief) should not also give rise to an entitlement to damages (with an uplift for flagrancy) for
harm suffered since provision of notice. There is no justification for such additional protection and the
upshot is that there is no incentive for ISP/Hosts to take any action to limit access to infringing material
and every incentive for them to maintain the access because the resulting traffic generates revenue. If
this layer of protection were removed so that Hosts and ISPs were liable in damages once on notice
(with an uplift for flagrant disregard), it would inevitably have a major impact on piracy because of the
deterrent effect of the consequences of disregarding notice (currently rife) and would promote greater
co-operation and a fairer balance between the interests of content owners and service providers.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of
private life and protection of personal data?
 YES
Any intrusion into private life or personal data is only permitted in circumstances where the subject of
that intrusion has committed an illegal act, in common with other areas of law those rights are not
intended to shield wrongdoers.
 NO – Please explain

       VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate for quite
some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A
unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and replace
national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this
as the only manner in which a truly Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured,
while others believe that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of
harmonisation while allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal
systems.

78.     Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as
well as a single framework for enforcement?
 YES
 NO
The concept of a single European copyright law was examined by the Wittem Group and was
subsequently abandoned. Cultural differences between the member states mean that a single copyright
code would be incredibly difficult to achieve at a political level. Contracts have been traded for value, on
a territorial basis, for centuries and any attempt to change this would be fraught with dangers. We see
no value in pursuing this idea.
 NO OPINION


79.      Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current
level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
No, we believe that this is unachievable and unlikely to deliver any tangible benefits to the creator or the
consumer; rather it would cause confusion as contracts are reworked and entities losing out would
require financial compensation.
