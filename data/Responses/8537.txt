Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?

My Answer: NO
* In the music sector, we do not feel like any new or extra legislative measure is needed to increase the cross-border availability of a variety of content services. The market is delivering, with over 260 music services and +30 million songs available to all EU citizens, often for free. For example, we work closely with I-tunes, and our catalogue is available in all territories we are entitled to deliver our content to. And this does not imply extra measures for clients who want to listen in those territories to our music.
* However, we believe that a number of measures could help level the playing field to make sure all repertoire is treated the same and to make sure local repertoire is not left out. 99% of music operators are micro, small and medium-sized, like we are, they represent 80% of all music released and 80% of the sector's jobs, but only 20% (!!) of the market share (80% is concentrated in the hands of the three remaining `Majors'). The `Majors' have so many economies of scale, we risk to be outnumbered in the long run, resulting in a creative oligopoly.
* Examples of measures which could help level the playing field are: "must carry" obligations for online services that have become essential facilities like YouTube/Google; diversity obligations for online services and platforms; obligation for such services to pay all repertoire-owners equally (!) and to refuse to give placement, output type and/or financial advances guarantees to the major content owners, etc.

 Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online       environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you? 

Answer: NO
* The application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment does not create problems for my label. These two rights are necessary to ensure appropriate remuneration when our artists' works are used. 
* I am not aware of any problems caused by the existence of these two rights, which are sometimes licensed together.

 Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


Answer: YES
* Links making copyrighted works available to the public should be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder if they lead to a protected work which was not already freely available online, i.e. the communication of which had not initially been authorised. This was confirmed by the Court of Justice of the EU on 13 February in the `Svensson' case.

 What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.


Answer: 
* Enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content would have dramatic consequences on the primary market for the same content. It would - again -  imply a devaluation of the value of music
* We would oppose legislation enabling such resale of previously purchased digital content: it is impossible to ensure that the reseller has effectively deleted all existing copies of the work he/she decides to resell; the quality of the copy would be as good as the original while the price would be lower, so this would effectively amount to unfair competition for original works; the overall number of sales of originals would automatically be reduced, which would in turn mean prices for original works would rise. The value of (digital) music is already under high pressure; if this initiative is encouraged, it might develop that specific market, but decrease the value of the music market as a whole.

 Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital     environment?


Answer: Yes
* The extension of the term of protection for music recordings has allowed to close part of the gap between the EU and the US (the US term of protection for music recordings is 95 years). 
* An adequate term of protection is particularly important for me to be able to make longer-term business decisions, knowing that I will have 70 years to recoup the money I invested in a music recording. This is crucial for me to be able to take risk and invest in new talent.  The investments needed to make an artist successful have become, in contradiction to what most people think, more intense than ever. There is a `tsunami' of music, and making that specific artist being discovered above all the rest, is a very time consuming  -  dixit costly  -  investment. As the margins on exploitation of digital music are a fraction of the ones on physical exploitation, it will cost more time in order to recoup our investment - and above that gain extra money to invest in new talent again.
* If anything, the term of copyright for music recordings should be extended. At the very least, it should be retained at 70 years.

58c. Have you experienced problems resulting from the way the users are using pre-      existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the internet, including across borders? 



Answer: NO
* When it comes to so-called user-generated content, I license platforms on which such content is uploaded  -  this content is therefore licensed through the platform, instead of requiring licences for each individual user.
* Similarly, regarding small-scale uses, users can generally upload their videos to online platforms and then embed them on their own website, ensuring that the video is covered by a licence. 
* At the same time we have (some) control on the exploitation (fi Monetising  -  tool on YT)
* We understand that a legal analysis commissioned by the European Commission concluded that the introduction of a new exception for user-generated content would not be appropriate.

 In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying exception in the digital environment?


Answer: NO
* The private copying system is virtuous and strikes the right balance between the ability for citizens to make private copies and the compensation of rightholders. 
* The current private copying system should be maintained and improved to minimise existing differences between member states, i.e. where EU Member States have introduced an exception for private copying they should have in place a fair compensation scheme for right holders, and they should regularly update the list of media/devices eligible for private copying compensation. It is a fact that the list of media/devices is different from country to country  -  is should be the aim of the EU to harmonise that list in the most comprehensive way possible.

 Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?


Answer: YES
* Civil enforcement systems allow me to ask for permanent injunctions against copyright infringers. Without proper enforcement, my record label's revenues will keep decreasing, which will in turn have a strong impact on my ability to sign new artists and keep investing in talent. 
* My biggest challenge is that, as a small label, I do not have the resources necessary to monitor all platforms where unauthorised copies of my artists' works are available. 
* Civil redress channels should be made more accessible, and the predictability in civil redress should also be improved by clarifying the principles for estimating damages, calculating costs and defining `commercial scale' more precisely. 
* In general, damages awarded in IPR cases should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Enforcement would be more efficient if member states introduced more effective remedies and deterrents.

 Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.

Answer:
* I believe the existing copyright framework has proven flexible enough to accommodate new uses, but what is lacking is better enforcement by the government or the EU of the copyright. 
* Internet service providers (ISP's) should cooperate more and better with rightholders, to make sure unauthorised works are taken down quickly and do not reappear immediately after the takedown. This is crucial as small businesses such as my label do not have the resources required to continuously monitor hundreds of platforms hosting infringing content and thousands of "sharing points" providing links to these files. 
* When the `search' function is used, the legal sites should always be listed first, that is also an efficient way to tackle illegal links.
