Facts about The Danish Union of Journalists  -  Media & Communications 

The Danish Union of Journalists (DJ) represents 17.000 journalists, photographers, cartoonists, authors, subtitlers, tv-workers, visualizers, communicators etc. working as employees or as freelancers producing content for TV, audio-visual content in general, books, e-books, magazines, journals, newspapers etc. within the market: media and communication.  

DJ represents the authors rights and negotiates agreements on behalf of our members directly with the media employers or through collective societies who make agreements covering a large number of rights and works made by members as well as non-represented right holders because of the general extended collective license provision in the Danish Copyright Act.

[In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
* DJ is hardly ever consulted directly to grant multi-territorial licences.

* Resent European initiatives have shown that the EU legislative framework on copyright does not constitute a problem in terms of the availability and portability of online services offering copyright protected works across EU. 
* The main issues that sometimes lead the commercial users to limit their services to a certain territory are not copyright but business choices based on language, local marketing strategies focused on local interests, local advertising market, return investment etc. 
* In addition to this, high levels of piracy and unauthorized use of protected works discourage new players from investing in the market, as they find it difficult to recoup their investment when competing with wide availability of completely free unauthorized uses.

* In the case of cross-border licensing of retransmission of television, there has only been a small problem for a very limited group of people on the demand for a TV service containing Danish channels. Penetrating another European marked, would depend on significant targeting (through for instance subtitles and marketing), which would not be economically feasible.
The amount of requests are limited by the fact that some licenses in some areas already exist,  for instance concerning Danish soldiers abroad, sailors on Danish shipping vessels and latest a license to an online TV-distributor.


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above  -  what would be the best way to tackle them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* 

In our point of view, based on the very few numbers of enquiries received, the multi-territoriality does not constitute a problem.

The legal foundation in the general extended collective license provision to enter into licenses regarding digitizing and making available old releases of periodicals for the use in Denmark already exists. Copydan Writing's licenses are as a result extended to covering non-represented rightsholders as well as represented rightsholders.

 [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?

[In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
As presented during the Licenses for Europe initiative, there is no need for a legislative change to increase the cross-border availability of content services as these constantly develop, the current copyright framework is not an obstacle to their growth. 
However, the issue of the "adequate level of protection for right holders", especially in the digital environment, has not been addressed satisfactorily at EU level. For example for authors, royalties from digital usages are still very low. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations  -  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  -  sufficiently clear? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
* The question is best suited to be decided by the EU Court of Justice whom will take into regard specificities of different situations, which is not suitable for legislative solution.
The scope of "making available" online is much wider and much more diverse, and does not fit with "country of origin" and why this has worked for satellite transmission. With satellite there is a system in place in case of for instance cable retransmission. Online, significant question regarding linking and other forms of reuse remain.
A meaningful European policy should focus on how to make it much easier to get pan-European licenses for the users while effectively protecting an adequate remuneration for creators. The new CRM Direktive was enacted with this focus. DJ believes we should continue in this direction. The copyright owners have made many efforts to make pan-European licensing easier for digital service providers always bearing in mind, that the right holders should have a fair and adequate remuneration. The EU policy makers and the Commission play an active role in this debate and we should continue this debate bearing the international conventions in mind.

[In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
Under The Berne Convention, the authorship is determined based on the country of origin of the author or where the work is first published in the Berne Union if the author is not a national of a Berne Union country. Since the transfer of rights is a contractual issue between the creators and the subsequent right holder, it is rather straightforward to determine who holds the right to license in a territory where protected works will be made available to the public.
Furthermore clearance or application of more rights does already take place concerning radio and television (clearance of reproduction and communication to the public rights). The management of these two rights has never been split  -  including for satellite broadcasting  -  because both rights have been exercised through collective management societies. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public  -  or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
* "Hyperlink" is a very generic technical term, and a general exception on linking to protected works would have huge consequences, and make numerous types of circumvention of copyright possible. Certain types of linking definitely constitute "making available" to example a link making protected works available by leading directly (embedding or framing etc.). The rights holders should in these cases authorize the use. 
* A general exception on linking could create an unwanted effect of limiting the licenses being granted for use of copyrighted works e.g. images and visual art on open websites and thus prove counterproductive in institutions efforts to make Europe's cultural heritage available to the public. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user's computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
* The question is best suited to be decided by the EU Court of Justice whom will take into regard specificities of different situations, which is not suitable for legislative solution.


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by giving examples
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extending the principle of exhaustion to digital delivery would allow the first purchaser of a film or a book via digital transmission (e.g. download to own) to share it immediately and legally with audiences around the world who would not pay for the content they are viewing or listening to.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The shared file will be a perfect copy of the original, with a virtually unlimited life span and the ability to be further distributed to an unprecedented number of viewers and listeners through broadband computer networks accessible to all. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The exhaustion principle was meant for physical bearers of copyright-protected content in the analogue world. No valid cultural or commercial consideration speaks in favour of extending it to the digital environment where it could completely undermine any commercial cultural production.

Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of works and other subject matter? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
* Collective management organisations are already a source of comprehensive rights' information and they are constantly working on addressing the evolving needs of the market. Their industry databases are dynamic and have the critical functionality to determine rights' ownership status of the works at the time when they are used, and thus supporting efficient licensing and accurate payment. 
* In order for a database to be effective and functional for licensing it needs to be dynamic, elaborate, fit for purpose and interoperable with the other metadata databases, reporting and dispute resolution processes used by the sector or industry.
* Therefore, this issue can best be dealt with by the industry in each sector according to the needs of that sector in a way that is functional and purposeful for both users and right holders. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What would be the possible advantages of such a system? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

.............................................................................................................

.............................................................................................................



* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
* With regard to audio-visual works, many works are created during or immediately before live broadcast and simultaneous retransmission.  The numerous contributors, and possible right holders in preexisting works used, in these work are impossible to know beforehand, and a registration system would not help the licensing of for instance cable-retransmission.

In relation to works existing prior to the creation of such a system, vast funds would be required, in order to have a covering registry.

The registry would not be operational before a very large share of the enormous number of existing works had entered into the system. Even then, the creation of an EU system could lead to a defacto "formality" for the protection of a work, as users could deny payment for the use of rights, in cases where works have not been registered or single contributors in a work has wrongly not been registered. It is not feasible that a system could be accurate and operational enough to justify the enormous cost of establishing it.

In the field of visual arts, huge amount of works are being created all the time (e.g. photographs). A visual artist or photographer may create thousands of works in his or her lifetime. Traditionally, visual works are not routinely registered. Such a registration would not be very precise. It is common for a photographer to take many pictures of the motive from different angles or for a visual artist to create many untitled works. So for a vast amount of visual works there is no unique identifier to register.

As shown under question 15, collective management organizations have already well-functioning databases.

What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
* With reference to the answers to question 15 and 17, we believe that the industries are guarantors to effective and dynamic registration systems

It is important to ensure that rights holders receive remuneration for the use of their works why identifiers is a useful tool. Therefore, the various industries where our members are represented in (text, tv- and audio-visual, visual arts etc.) have developed registration systems. As an organization representing all sorts of right owners, we are confident with the way it is administered.

As a member of Ifrro (International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisations), Copydan Writing supports the work with identifiers in projects such as ARROW, ISNI and ISTC. 

Copydan Writing has developed a rights holder register as a means to identify rights holders and ensure correct distribution when we remunerate rights holders individually for licensees' use of their works in regards to the licensees agreement with Copydan Writing.

* Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The optional list and the differences between national rules implementing copyright exceptions do not present difficulties for the use of works, cross-border copyright licensing or the market for copyright works in general.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copyright owners routinely grant licenses covering many jurisdictions, whether it is a group of territories, the entire EU or the world. At no time does the fact that an exception in one EU member state differs from the equivalent exception in another member state give rise to complexity or problems in practice.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
* The Danish Union of Journalists is of the opinion that current EU law and international treaties provide the necessary flexibility for copyright and exceptions.
* Through our respective Collective Management Organizations, we provide widespread access to works through dedicated licensing for e.g. teaching, educational institutions, archives etc. 
* Exceptions to copyright should only be applied as a measure of last resort and licensing should be the preferred solution. In different member states, different levels of licensing tools and solutions exist. We think the best approach is to seek to strengthen licensing solutions though positive and constructive initiatives such as licensing for Europe. Creating mandatory exceptions on the other hand, would damage existing licensing models and thus damage the creation of jobs in the creative sector.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no need for new limitations or exceptions. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change should only be considered with strong supporting evidence and only if it is clear that licensing is not an appropriate option for clearing rights in the market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We think the best approach is to seek to strengthen licensing solutions though positive and constructive initiatives such as licensing for Europe. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, we also believe that collective licensing of rights is a better alternative to an exception since it provides users with an easier access to protected content, offers them with the needed legal certainty, while protecting the legitimate interest of rights holders.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In several countries in the EU the concept of Extended Collective Licensing (ECL) is used as a tool to enable licensing in various areas where both users and the rights holder community benefit from easy access and payment for usages in areas where the rights holders might not be able to address the licensing directly. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain why 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe there are no benefits in providing greater flexibility in the application of the limitations and exceptions. Indeed, it is more likely to create greater uncertainty, which would increase commercial and litigation costs.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system for interpretation of law through the courts and CJEU has provided a line of cases interpreting the principles of directives.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specifically, the introduction of the fair use doctrine would not be an appropriate approach to introduce flexibility.  There is empirical evidence from the US of the high cost of litigation involving fair use. The costs mean that only the largest companies are confident to rely on the doctrine, with smaller users and smaller rights holders disadvantaged.  Even then, fair use is only workable in the US because of the substantial line of jurisprudence interpreting the concept. There is no case for implementation in the EU; this conclusion is backed up by the analysis in the De Wolf report. 


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question] 
* A fair use exception does not fit with the European law tradition. Even in the USA, where common law is used, significant uncertainties still prevail, especially regarding new forms of use, even with decades of judgments concerning fair use. Periodic revision would be a problem as well, as revising the law could disrupt the perceived balance of thousands and thousands of contract concerning rights. DJ believes that specific exceptions combined with flexible licensing solutions will meet the demands of users, rights holders and the market better than a general fair use exception.

 [Open question]
* The Danish Union of Journalists is of the opinion, that current EU law and international treaties provide the necessary flexibility for copyright and exceptions and limitations thereto. There is currently no need to introduce any new exception or to introduce a fair-use doctrine. Collective Management Organizations provide the necessary solutions through detailed licensing. The general ECL provision in the Danish Copyright Act can and is frequently used as the legal foundation for an agreement between institutional users and the Collective Management Organizations. Both users and rights holders achieve in this manner a more flexible system. This was also a conclusion in the Commission's Licences for Europe project.
* The Danish Ministry of Culture's website publishes their approvals relating to the management of both extended collective licenses and specific collective licenses: http://kum.dk/Kulturpolitik/Ophavsret/Godkendelser/
The Danish Ministry of Culture do state it this way at their own website:
Copyright is an important part of the knowledge economy. Well-balanced copyright makes it possible for the authors to earn a living from their works at the same time as securing the access of the general public to a wide range of these works. 
The task of the Ministry of Culture is to contribute to making copyright function as well as possible in practice. This work takes its point of departure in a Nordic legal unit and within the framework of EU directives and international conventions concerning the area. 
One of the special features of Danish copyright is the use of extended collective licenses, which make it possible to license the use of a large volume of works protected by copyright. The extended collective licenses are published on the website of the Ministry of Culture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
* Collections in national institutes are often in the national language. Therefore, there is no significant demand for access to Danish collections from other countries. In Denmark, there are numerous agreements regarding the mass use in libraries and archives. The budget of these are often linked to public service obligations  -  which are limited to the relevant member state, and their funding therefor does not allow for entering into cross-border licenses.
The general ECL provision in the Danish Copyright Act can be used as the legal foundation for an agreement between an institutional user and a CMO for giving access to a collection or parts thereof. 
It is mentioned in the explanatory notes to article 50,2, that the provision can be applied when wanting to digitize cultural heritage.


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Open question]
* The Orphan Works Directive will be implemented in member states, and relevant stakeholders have agreed upon key principles on digitizing and making available of out-of-commerce works in 2011 MoU. There should be a follow up on the legal basis of the cross border availability as regards the 2011 MoU, which would create more legal certainty and facilitate licensing.

* With the 2008 amendment to the Danish Copyright Act introducing the general ECL provision (sec. 50(2)), users such as libraries and collecting societies were enabled to enter into mass digitization projects. The provision was introduced as a means to help facilitate digitizing the Danish cultural heritages and mass digitization projects which include orphan works. Since 2008 the Danish CMO's (e.g. Copydan Writing) have entered into a number of licenses regarding mass digitization and making available.
The licenses that are based on the ECL system cover the use of works in Denmark. Such ECL licenses are limited to national use, because the extended collective licensing (ECL) only applies within the Danish territory. To be able to give such licenses cross-border effect, it would require that licenses based on ECL or other forms of collective rights management issued in one member state to be recognized in other member states. In the 2011 MoU it is written in preamble 11 that they are "calling on the European Commission, to the extent required to ensure legal certainty in a cross-border context, to consider the type of legislation to be enacted ...".
In Denmark the legislation is in place, but whether or not national legislation is required can only be answered when the EC introduces a solution in relation to the 2011 MoU.

* In Denmark, the system of ECL licensing agreements with schools, universities etc. functions very well to the benefit for both rights holders and educational institutions. Licensing means flexibility and avoidance of uncertainty regarding the understanding of an exception limited to "illustration" for educational purposes.


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there are problems, how would they best be solved?  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
* In our experience, collective licensing facilitates easy and straight forward access to content, while ensuring the rights holders are remunerated for the exploitation of their works.
There are licenses for numerous uses of audiovisual material in teaching, through the extended collective license (ECL) and individual mandates in Denmark. This includes the recording and streaming of TV and film in schools, by teachers and students. This also covers the use of large amounts of European content, which exceeds the actual demand, why cross-border access is not a pressing issue for schools.
Please find The Danish Ministry of Culture's website and the approvals relating to the management of both extended collective licenses and specific collective licenses http://kum.dk/Kulturpolitik/Ophavsret/Godkendelser/

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
* In Denmark, we apply extended collective licensing (ECL). Because ECL based licenses, include all works of all artists of a defined type it can provide the broadest possible access to use of content and a high level of legal security for the users. At the same time, it provides rights holders with fair remuneration for the exploitation of their works and support that content creators are able and encouraged to continue creating new works. The system is accepted by both educational institutions and rights holders and has been for many years, which is the best testimony of its success.
The use of the ECL is consequently very successful, and enables Copydan to clear the rights for many different uses in schools, but as mentioned individual mandate agreements are also used. The agreements are very successful, and the main licenses cover almost 100 % of all schools in Denmark.
Copydan Writing enters into licenses with the educational sector based on the ECL system. The ECL system is a way of managing rights in organized form and is not to be seen as an exception. 
As Copydan Writing licenses based on the ECL system the uncertainty in regards to the scope of "illustration for teaching" is avoided. It is worth mentioning that there has not been need for settling of disputes in a court of law. All matters have been solved amongst the parties and if necessary, it is possible to bring questions on the fee of the license before the Copyright License Tribunal. There have not been any cases before the tribunal in recent years. 
Copydan in general collects annually millions of euro in remuneration to Danish and foreign rights holder for use of protected subject matter in educational institutions. Hence, these funds are important for the possibility of producing and distributing new creative content to the benefit of the educational system. 
The development of the licenses is ongoing and occurs through continued discussions with the educational sector and the rights holder organizations. 
All licenses allow the institutions to copy for educational purposes and for internal administrative use.
The Danish Union of Journalists is one of many member organizations of Copydan (Copydan Visual Arts, Copydan Writing, Copydan World TV, Copydan AVU-media and Copydan Archive) and we are represented in the boards and thus support the widespread use of extended collective licensing. Both users and rights holders benefit from this legal system.

What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for research purposes? How successful are they? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
* DJ is of the opinion, that current EU law and international treaties provide the necessary flexibility for copyright, exceptions, and limitations thereto. There is currently no need to introduce any new exception or to introduce a fair-use doctrine. Collective Management Organizations provide the necessary solutions through detailed licensing. The general ECL provision in the Danish Copyright Act can and is frequently used as the legal foundation for this type of agreements. Both users and rights holders achieve in this manner a more flexible system. 
* Copydan Writing's licenses with educational institutions supplement the licenses that the institution can enter into directly with publishers concerning periodicals and other scientific and research publications.

The question of User Generated Content (UGC) is an almost impossible question to address at a European legal level. Not only do we not have a commonly accepted definition of UGC, but since the issue has not yet been the focus of European court cases, lengthy surveys on the issue concluding that copyright provisions hinder the freedom of expression, or broadly accepted conclusions from the License for Europe initiative, it seems an impossible  -  and highly unnecessary - initiative to introduce provisions regulating this. And definitely impossible on these grounds to introduce an EU-exemption on UGC use.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of many questions that arise when investigating UGC is that the initial use might be initiated by a private individual, but the distribution to the public takes place in forums controlled by highly commercial global internet service providers (ISP's). These ISP's do not accept any responsibility for the content on their platforms, but hide behind the provisions of the E-commerce directive, which makes it very hard for authors and their representatives to make licensing agreements about the use (and micro-use).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another important question is the very different perception of the use the author can have compared to the user. What might seem non-commercial to the user can very well be commercial for the author and provide a means of income for him/her in the years to come.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The author will also have an interest in being able to control how the work is being used according to the droit moral rules and this need has repeatedly been stated in various copyright conventions, such as the Bern convention, the Humans Rights convention etc. A film director or a writer or journalist will have a clear legal and personal interest in being able to protect the work, and the way the work is presented. Not to mention the importance of any democratic European society of being introduced to credible information that has a clear "return address". 
Notwithstanding the above mentioned arguments, many European countries have private use provisions in their copyright legislation which thoroughly regulate the possibility for private individual's to express themselves through UGC. In almost all of these countries there exists CMO's who are more than willing to issue licensing deals for the use  -  especially in the area of music. What is needed is the acknowledgment that this use can be potentially detrimental to the author (and in the end to the society) and provisions that take this fact into account. The making of yet another exemption does not solve the issue.

* Private copying and reprography

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is at present no need to clarify the scope of private copying, since the EU court (CJEU) in a number of both resolved and pending cases have been asked to give the needed interpretation of the private copying exceptions. Cases such as the Amazon ruling (C-521-11), the Padawan case (C-476/08), the Opus decision (C462/09), the VG Wort decision (C-457/11-460/11) and the pending Copy-Dan case (C463/12) have (and will) clarify potential legal uncertainties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is not recommendable that the Commission introduces legal initiatives on this area that will render the CJEU rulings void.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?

 YES  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is very important to bear in mind that the existence of exclusive rights/contractual rights/licensing schemes in no way is contradictory to the possibility for member states to have private copy levies schemes. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These underlining rights regulate different actions, as one regulate the commercial download service by a digital service provider and the payment for this and the other regulate how manufacturers (and the underlining consumers) are responsible to pay levies for the private copies of those downloads.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing  allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders' revenue on the other? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The last 10 years have without a doubt documented that private copy levies in no way affect the development and functioning of new business models in the digital and online field. On the contrary, those markets have grown exponentially over the last years. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Danish Union of Journalists supports transparency in all matters of copyright generated levies and therefore we believe that it could give added value to make levies visible on the invoices in some clearly defined circumstances  -  which is already in effect in certain EU member states.
Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes, which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments.

We believe that the European Court over the years has dealt with many necessary interpretations of the private copying regimes.

* Fair remuneration of authors and performers

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The best mechanism to ensure an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of works and performances in the digital world is a combination of exclusive rights and remuneration rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This applies to authors and performers alike and to both audio and audiovisual content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The exclusive rights presently granted by EU law must be fully upheld and respected. They provide an important and indispensable part of the basis for any bargaining, collective or individual, of the fundamental terms for the creation or performance of an artistic work, and for the exploitation of it in different forms and media.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, when it comes to cross-border online use of audiovisual productions, negotiations based on exclusive rights have not provided adequate or meaningful economic solutions for creators and performers. This is partly due to the fact that in the audiovisual field authors and performers have very little bargaining strength in most European countries. It also reflects the difficulty for talent and management alike trying to assess the economic value of such use in a market not yet fully functioning. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is why the EU must introduce a supplementary right to equitable remuneration in favor of authors and performers for the making available on demand of audiovisual productions. The right must be unwaivable and the remuneration shall be collected from the user and subject to mandatory collective management. This additional right shall not prejudice existing or future agreements, whether individual or collective, granting payment for the use of the performance, whether or not such agreements include a transfer or assignment of the making available right.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A complementary right of this nature would greatly facilitate digital cross-border licensing and would help the development of a single market for audiovisual productions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the audio field, the great majority of European performers have a similar need for a supplementary remuneration right to provide them with a much-needed income in respect of the use of their performances on the internet. It is important, however, that existing regimes of individual or collective bargaining for primary royalties applying to featured performers should not be undermined, and that the unwaivable remuneration right against users for online exploitation should in practice supplement existing exclusive rights, whether or not they have been transferred or assigned to the producer for a primary royalty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EU should protect authors and performers when signing a contract, since they will always be in a weak bargaining position. Transfer of all rights in return for a lump sum should not be allowed, not even when specifying payment for each use, since neither of the parties are able to estimate the value of the rights at the point of contract. The EU should introduce a principle of fair ongoing payment for internet use of works and performances.

* Respect for rights
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The civil enforcement system in the EU should be made more efficient so as to effectively address and deter services that offering infringing material to their users, whether funded by subscription, donation or advertising.  These types of services should not be entitled to the immunity from liability offered by the Article 14 hosting exception of the E-Commerce Directive.  The Directive was intended to award immunity to particular activities carried out by neutral internet intermediaries and recital 42 of the Directive refers to a protected service as being "merely technical, automatic and passive."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current system of notice and take down puts all the resource and financial burdens on rights holders while services have no incentive to assist in detection of illegal content, even though the technological means are available.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are technological measures available for service providers to allow them to easily and effectively identify files and infringements, based on prior notifications given to them by rights holders.  Many services now employ such measures, but unfortunately most providers still do not adopt this technology or take these steps. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system of notice and takedown is ineffective to address the problem of illegal content appearing online. Once files have been removed through a notice and takedown procedure, they can quickly re-appear either being re-uploaded by the same internet user, or by a different user of the same online service, or alternatively by a user of an entirely different online service or platform.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need clarification that the hosting exemption is only available to particular activities, which are merely technical, automatic and passive, where carried out by neutral online services, and not to platforms, which are designed or optimized to make available or facilitate the making available of illegal content, such as material, which infringes copyright.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, we need clarification that notice and takedown means, "notice and stay down" and that service providers are required to remove not only an example URL but also all instances of the specific infringement or illegal content once they are notified and/or become aware
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough to allow for  sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We think that the legal framework, which establishes the liability of intermediaries, has created the wrong balance. It creates incentives for intermediaries to be entirely passive to avoid liability for licensing.  They have no incentive to inform their customers and consumers or to help with awareness and education of consumers.  The notice and take down system is placing a burden on rights holders but is not operating to its full benefit.  The responsibility of other intermediaries, such as advertising or payment services, must be more clearly defined, perhaps in the form of a joint agreement or MOU to ensure they take active role in preventing their services being used to support unauthorized and illegal businesses.

* A single EU Copyright Title

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES

 NO

Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, the differences between Member States' legislation are not problematic. The addition of a second, parallel EU copyright title is unnecessary and would create confusion and cost. The existing EU legislative acts already ensure a high standard of copyright protection.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, it is widely recognised and also mentioned several times in the DeWolf Study that the rights provided by copyright already to a great extent are harmonised at EU level. They also follow in most instances the EU's international obligation under copyright treaties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We recognise that there may be some theoretical benefits in establishing a European copyright code but not clear that it would deliver a single market in practice.   Also, a single copyright title would not per se deliver a single market to consumers.  The factors that divide markets now, such as language, culture, or inhibit roll out of services, such as payment systems, will continue despite changes to IP and they are the critical challenge for policy makers. Therefore, at a time when the efforts and actions of policy makers across Europe are better focussed on practical solutions, we believe the copyright code is not a priority.

Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A secure copyright regime is essential to Europe's economic stability, future growth, and the cultural diversity of the EU.  This is because it ensures that creators are paid for the use of their works and incentivises them to free up access to works, which in turn stimulates innovation, investment and ultimately the creation of new works.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any programme which seeks to ensure a copyright framework for digital markets must be based on two primary objectives.  First, to facilitate a rights regime which means consumers can legally access content, when and how they want it.  Secondly, and importantly, ensure that rightsholders are fairly remunerated in a digital market when their works are used and monetised by other providers.     
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The value generated by digital technologies that owe their success mostly to access to creative works is not fairly shared with the creators of those works. There is a transfer of value in favour of technical intermediaries in the online environment and adequate remuneration of authors and artists, and rightsholders in general, for the use of their works on digital platforms is not secured. The digital exploitation involves its own players - host providers, access providers, search engines, etc. which generate high revenues thanks to the use of copyright protected works and demand of consumers for `broader'-bands to use creative works. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The activity of many of these service providers is not limited to a mere conduit or stocking of information: they are designed to make content available, organise the means they put at the public's disposal to access such content, develop special search engines, develop software to enable consumers to view and listen to the content, seek to develop the widest audience possible and seek to valorise the access given to protected content through advertising strategies. These intermediaries carry out acts of reproduction and/or of communication to the public for which they would be considered liable if they did not benefit from the "safe harbour regime" under the E-commerce Directive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe there remain significant questions whether the current framework is creating sufficient value for rightsholders. The current digital ecosystem allows providers and intermediaries to monetise rights protected works without adequately remunerating rightsholders.  If the EU is to continue to enjoy the benefits, in jobs and economic growth, of a world leading cultural sector this must be addressed.
