     I.      Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

Context of the response

Since the invention of the printing press, technology has always reshaped the way in which
content is created, distributed and accessed. The market has always adapted and continues to
adapt to new forms of creation, distribution and use.

It is clear from even the most superficial analysis of market based licensing solutions that
different licensing solutions are deployed by rightsholders to meet the needs of the market and
that a plurality of approaches is both appropriate and desirable from the perspective of
competition as well as innovation.

In the offline and online environments there are a multitude of examples of collective rights
management licensing solutions co-existing with direct licensing solutions and national
licensing solutions co-existing with multi-territory licensing solutions. These different
approaches complement and/or compete with each other contributing to the continuing
evolution of market based solutions to meet the needs of consumers, licensees and
rightsholders. Practical examples of this diversity in the field of musical works include by
way of example but not limitation:

    •    Multi-territory licensing solutions that co-exist with national licensing solutions:

         These are evident in the digital context but this duality of approach is not new.
         Physical sound carriers for example can be licensed on a multi-territory basis (the so-
         called Central Licensing Agreements) to meet the needs of international record
         companies as well as being licensed on a national basis to meet the needs of local
         record companies.

    •    Collective licensing solutions that co-exist with repertoire specific or direct licensing
         solutions:

         These are not only evident in the more traditional manifestations of the music industry
         but it is important to note that repertoire specific and direct licensing solutions include
         licensing models that are different to and compete with the traditional music industry
         such as Creative Commons licenses and so called “buy-out libraries”.

The aggregation of the rights necessary to license a typical music service offering a catalogue
of several million sound recordings across multiple territories involves pulling together the
rights in works and recordings embodying the creativity, performances and rights of hundreds
of thousands of authors, performers, publishers and producers. It is a testament to the
capacity of the market to find licensing solutions even in the face of deep challenges posed by
piracy and the decline of traditional business models that rightsholders have, in a relatively
short space of time, been able to put in place such licensing solutions on a voluntary basis.
The solutions on offer have encompassed large multi territory streaming and download music
services, small scale users and User Generated Content services.

The market has proved that it can find solutions and that it can do so in a voluntary and
organic way that is able to continuously adapt. Market based solutions may not be able to
answer every question that the market asks immediately but they are inherently more flexible
and therefore more capable of meeting the demands of a changing environment than
mandatory solutions. In addition proposals for material reductions in the scope of protection


                                                                                                  9
BRU5269590/1 PENDING-031860
afforded to creators and rightsholders by copyright or for mandatory licensing solutions that
remove the scope for rightsholder (and user) choice and competition, serve to increase
uncertainty and therefore to reduce the appetite for innovation and investment in the creative
sector.

It is interesting to note certain key differences between digital technology and previous
technological advancements. The digital ecosystem is dominated by a very limited number of
multinational companies most of whom are based outside the EU. Whilst they may have
originated outside the EU, these companies have not been prevented by European copyright
law from providing their services in the EU. It is also important to note that within each
particular digital business model there is typically one market leader that is the largest player
by a substantial margin on a global basis or at least in the EU. The largest of the companies in
the digital space are of an economic size and influence that is beyond doubt.

The arrival of previous technologies tended to be accompanied by the introduction of new
rights and protections for rightsholders in recognition of the fact that new technologies
typically enabled new forms of infringement or free riding. If left unchecked, these would
result in an unfair appropriation of the commercial value created by copyright and related
rights to the detriment of rightsholders to the detriment of creativity and ultimately to the
detriment of the cultural and the economic benefits derived by society from Intellectual
Property.

Despite the obvious scope for and clear evidence of abuses of copyright, moral rights,
personal data and privacy at a significant scale, the direction of travel from a policy
perspective has to date tended to appear to be focussed on enabling the digital ecosystem at
the expense of rightsholders, creators and individual citizens. We hope that the ongoing
review of copyright, which comes at time when the impact of the digital economy on other
fundamental rights including rights to personal data and privacy are also under scrutiny, will
lead to upholding fundamental principles that ensure that creators, rightholders and citizens
continue to be able to be entitled to the rights necessary to control the fruits of their creativity,
the rights that they have invested in their personal data and their privacy from unauthorised
use by users and by service providers large or small. We believe that it remains as critical as
ever to treat these moral, economic and personal rights with respect to ensure a sustainable
and responsible future for present and future generations.

     II.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories.
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

     NO
This response is given in the context of the questionnaire with a focus on whether the
territoriality of rights or copyright law present a barrier to making content services available
on a multi-territorial basis. As outlined in our response to question 3 neither the territoriality
of rights nor copyright law are themselves a barrier to the granting of licences on a multi-
territorial basis. It is true that not all online services are available on a pan European or multi
territorial basis or on a fully harmonised basis in or from all Member States. However, this is
true of a wide variety of services including services unconnected with the sphere of copyright
or copyright law.


     NO OPINION


2.     [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

   NO
This response is given in the context of the questionnaire with a focus on whether copyright
laws are themselves a barrier to the provision of online services across borders in the EU.
Please see the response to question 1 and the response to question 4. Our experience in music
publishing is that copyright laws are not an impediment to the licensing of rights on a multi-
territory basis.

3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.

Sony ATV has had arrangements to license rights to online content services on a multi
territorial basis in place since 2008. All of the major legal digital services are licensed by us
on a multi territorial basis including but not limited to Apple iTunes, Spotify, YouTube,
Google Play and Amazon. It is important to note that the availability of multi-territorial
licenses is not restricted to the largest services. The services licensed cover a wide variety of
business models including music download services, music streaming services (subscription
based as well as advertisement funded), audio visual streaming, audio visual rental and audio
visual download services as well as user generated content services. The uses covered by and
our revenues from online multi-territorial licences exceed those from online licences restricted
to one member state. This would not be possible if copyright were a barrier to the offering of
multi-territorial licences.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]


Whilst copyright law and the territoriality of rights have not been barriers for Sony ATV to
engage in multi territory licensing, it is clear that there are underlying challenges for services
that are available in one member state to be available to citizens in all member states. Those
challenges include the fact that there is no uniformity of culture, language or economy as
between member states. Content services seek to provide services in those territories where
they consider it to be desirable and economically viable to do so. Please see the response to
question 6.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial


                                                                                               13

restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
    YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

    NO
Please see the response to question 3. Sony ATV has organised its rights to enable multi-
territory digital licensing and within that framework generates more value than national
digital licensing solutions. It would in that context be counter intuitive to seek to limit the
scope of the territories covered by those licenses in circumstances where there is agreement
with a licensee as to the commercial basis on which the license is offered. In fact certain of
the licences granted are not only pan European in scope but even extend to territories outside
the EU.

6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?


    YES – Please explain by giving examples

Many services elect not to launch or make their services available in all member states. There
are many reasons unrelated to copyright why this is the case including:

+        Certain services would prefer not to launch in a member state until they have created a
         localised version which is appropriate from the perspective of language as well as
         editorial content to ensure that their service can appeal to a broader cross section of
         citizens in that member state.

+        Certain economic constraints may render the launch of a service in multiple member
         states unattractive. By way of example, advertisement funded services rely on
         advertisement revenues for their viability. In that context it is important to recognise
         that the advertising market is often very national. Maximising advertising revenues
         therefore relies on (i) sourcing advertisements in each territory in which the service is
         available often requiring a local advertisement sales team and (ii) offering
         advertisements that are suitable for the local market and therefore that advertisers will
         pay for. An advertisement in French for a French product will not yield the same
         revenues from a German audience as it will from a French audience.

+        Launching any business (not just a content or a digital business) in multiple member
         states requires a greater degree of legal and contractual diligence and effort. This


                                                                                               14
BRU5269590/1 PENDING-031860

          data protection, privacy, and consumer law requirements.

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
     YES – Please explain

Legislative intervention may create uncertainty and reduce flexibility in a dynamic market.
Market based solutions in the area of licensing digital services on the other hand, are clearly
already in place and are evolving in a way in which is helping to achieve positive commercial
results. The market is finding a way, however, as with any evolutionary process the answers
to every question have not yet been definitively found and a certain degree of trial and error
can and should be expected. In a changing commercial and technological environment new
questions are posed on a regular basis. It seems only logical that a set of legislative solutions
– even if they were capable of catering for the current needs of the market - would be unable
to address those needs as they evolve. The evolution of solutions through the market provides
not only for greater speed and choice, but also the flexibility required when compared with
legislative intervention. Moreover, the prospect of legislative intervention (and with it
uncertainty about the future rules by which market participants will be expected to be
governed) has a chilling effect on innovation and investment both in content and in services.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this


16
  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.


                                                                                                        15
BRU5269590/1 PENDING-031860
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.


8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.

     YES
Since the introduction of the “making available” right there have been several legal decisions
that have affirmed that in the context of cross-border situations the making available right is
implicated at least at the point of reception. The country in which a content service is
received is the country where the impact of the service on rightsholders and on competing
legitimate services is the most relevant. This rationale is not only in line with the
interpretation of the law in relation to copyright but is reflected in the changes to VAT on
online services that are to be implemented in the EU in 2015 in recognition of the fact that
sales taxes on services offered to European Citizens should be at the rates that relate to the
country in which that citizen is located and should ultimately benefit their local economy.

Country of origin principles are however inadequate for varying reasons including:

+        Many services originate from outside the EU but European rightsholders (and
         consumers) should be entitled to adequate protection in Europe.

+        The country of origin of a service can clearly be determined by the service provider
         and, as with the current VAT regime, a country of origin principle will lead to services
         making decisions as to their “origin” which bear no relationship with the countries
         where the economic impact of their services on rightsholders or competing services
         are most acutely felt, resulting in an unfair distortion in the market.

Targeting is inadequate for many reasons including:

+        It is a subjective concept in an area where less certainty is undesirable.

+        Whether or not it is possible to determine with clarity if a service provider is
         exclusively targeting a group of customers in a particular country, it remains the case
         that such targeting (if it could be established) may not result in the use of the service
         being exclusively or even mostly restricted in practice to the target country or
         audience.

   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"

  The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

If “clarification” implies changes to the existing standards and principles, then clarification
could indeed have an effect. Moving to a territory of origin or a targeting principle would for

enforcement and would also create significant market uncertainty whilst rightsflows and
industry licensing structures were re-organised to take into account changes made.

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation

     NO
The question is focused on the distinction between making available and reproduction rights
within each rightsholder community or sector but does not take into account that all online
(and offline) services that are offering a meaningful amount of (in our case) music, require
multiple copyright and related right rights to be cleared and these vest in a multitude of
different rightsholders.

By way of illustration, a major music service will typically offer a catalogue of several
million sound recordings. This requires licensing arrangements to be in place to secure rights
from tens of collection societies or publisher licensing entities, thousands of producers and
hundreds of thousands of authors and performers. In the context of the sheer volume of rights
and rightsholders and the voluntary aggregation of the rights that already takes place to make

   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent

the licensing of these services possible, the distinction between the owners of the making
available and the reproduction rights is insignificant and in our experience it is typically not
problematic to ensure that the rights are voluntarily aggregated.

We believe therefore, that any legislative intervention that either (i) limits the ability of
rightsholders to voluntarily determine how to license or mandate their rights or (ii)
“eliminates” a category of rights in respect of which market solutions have developed and
commercial investments have been made creates uncertainty in the market to the detriment of
rightsholders and licensees.

3.       Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?


   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why

The legitimate provision of a hyperlink does not as a matter of practice typically involve an
express authorisation from rightsholders being given on a case by case basis.

The core issue is in fact whether the hyperlink is:

         (i)      a hyperlink is to a licensed or unlicensed source; and

         (ii)     if the hyperlink is to a licensed source whether it is consistent with the terms
                  under which that licensed source is operating.

A hyperlink to an infringing site serves to increase infringement and a rightsholder should be
entitled to take action to prevent the relevant infringement both against the relevant site but
equally against those providing hyperlinks to it.

A hyperlink to a licensed source that circumvents or breaches that licensed service’s terms
and conditions including the terms under which the service is licensed (by way of example by
circumventing the service’s business model and therefore the basis upon which the service
compensates rightsholders) results not only in copyright infringement but is equally
detrimental to the legitimate interests of the licensed service and distorts the market for legal
services to the detriment of consumers.

In all cases, it is incumbent on individuals and businesses that use the internet for commercial
or non-commercial purposes to act responsibly with regards to material they disseminate
either directly or through the provision of links.


   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific

4.        Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

The answer is given in the context of not having tried to resell digital files.

  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

BRU5269590/1 PENDING-031860
The response is given in the context of the music industry.

In the case of the sale of a physical copy (typically a CD) consumers acquire a physical
object. The consumer owns the physical object (the plastic/paper etc) but they do not own the
works and sound recordings that may be embodied in the object. The object comes with a
limited license that allows the owner of the physical object to listen to the sound recordings of
the works embodied in the object for so long as they own the object. The object itself may be
sold and with it the attached licence. Upon sale the seller cannot retain the object and does
not retain the license. The licence is attached to the physical object and moves with it.

In the case of a digital file, consumers do not acquire a physical object to which is attached a
license but instead effectively acquire a license which is personal to them. That licence may
allow the acquirer greater or more limited rights than the acquisition of a physical object. By
way of example:

         (a)      The purchaser of a permanent download is typically able to download
                  additional copies from the service that provided the download. This allows
                  further copies to be downloaded in many circumstances including where the
                  original device on which the download was stored fails or is lost. In that
                  respect the rights exceed the rights associated with a CD since the loss of a CD
                  does not entitle the owner to request a free replacement from the retailer.

         (b)      A subscriber to a tethered download service may hold a digital copy but only
                  for the duration of their subscription. In that respect the digital file comes with
                  rights that are shorter in duration than a CD albeit that they may come with
                  greater flexibility than a CD in other respects, and on terms that are clear to the
                  subscriber from the outset.

It is clear that the licenses granted in the case of physical copies are attached to the relevant
object and the object is priced accordingly whereas licenses granted in the case of digital files
are personal to the relevant consumer and are priced accordingly.

Introducing a resale concept for digital files would create some highly undesirable outcomes
including by way of example but not limitation, the possibility for a consumer who purchases
a permanent download to be able to sell the downloaded file to a third party whilst
contractually retaining the ability to re-download another copy from the original download
service from which they acquired it.

In the event that a resale right was introduced it would be necessary to have a wholesale
review of pricing and functionality in the download and cloud service markets (including such
functionality as the ability to re-download).

C.       Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.




                                                                                                  22
BRU5269590/1 PENDING-031860
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES


  NO
The answer is given on the basis that it suggests a compulsory registration requirement for
copyright protection.

Voluntary registries or databases detailing copyright works, associated creators and
rightsholders in a particular sector should be encouraged but should not form a legal
requirement for copyright protection.


     NO OPINION


16.        What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]

A voluntary system of registries or databases which are (i) authoritative (ii) comprehensive
and (iii) based on standard data protocols that facilitate automated processing should
significantly increase the efficiency and accuracy of any process for the identification of
rightsholders and the administration of licenses as well as enabling the proper identification of
authorship and compliance with moral rights.

Please refer to the Global Repertoire Database project as a valuable example.

17.        What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]

A compulsory registration system would conflict with current law and treaty obligations
including the Berne Convention.

A compulsory system would require an infrastructure and technical set up at member state
and European level. - This would likely entail difficulties outweighing possible benefits.


29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.


                                                                                                             23

18.      What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]

It would be beneficial if the European Commission could however provide incentives for the
creation of authoritative voluntary registries by ensuring that information relating to rights
ownership which is held within a recognised and authoritative registry or database should
constitute a rebuttable presumption of ownership in favour of the registered rightsholder.

This would not make registration a required formality for the subsistence of copyright rights
but would increase the efficiency by which rights could be asserted and therefore provide
additional incentives to voluntarily register in addition to gains in licensing efficiency and
accuracy.

D.       How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]

Please see the answer to question 18.

Political and funding support for industry initiatives would be extremely valuable. It should
be noted that the creative industries including a large number of SMEs and the support of EU

   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

institutions for sector initiatives can be helpful in ensuring the greatest level of SME
awareness, engagement and participation.


E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?

     YES – Please explain

The protection afforded by copyright is specific to a particular original expression of an idea
not to the idea itself. As is evident from the wide diversity and continued output of new
music, copyright does not represent a material barrier to the creation of new and original
works.

Any reduction in the term of copyright will have a negative impact on the appetite for
investment in creativity.

Any reduction in the term of copyright protection will reduce the ability for creators to leave a
legacy for their heirs which is already time limited.

     NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

 III.          Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract



35
     Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.


                                                                                                                 25
BRU5269590/1 PENDING-031860
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory

   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-

orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
   YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

   NO – Please explain

The most relevant exceptions have been adopted by the majority of members states.

states.

catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]


NO - Market based solutions have evolved and are evolving based on the current legislative
framework. The introduction or removal of specific exceptions will lead to uncertainty at a
time when certainty is called for to support the evolution of such market based solutions.




                                                                                          27

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
   YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

   NO – Please explain why

We believe that granting further flexibility is in fact likely to prove counterproductive as there
is a greater need for certainty in the market.

Please see the answers to questions 21 and 23.


   NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]

Please see the answer to question 24. We do not believe there is cause for introducing greater
flexibility.

For example, a more general “fair use” concept analogous to the United States of America
reduces certainty.

The USA has had the benefit of many decades of judicial interpretation but there are still
many open questions as to the scope of “fair use”. The EU would not have the benefit of
those decades of interpretation and would therefore be starting with greater uncertainty than
the USA has today.

The EU is more diverse in terms of its legal systems (even as between civil law and common
law systems) and in terms of cultural and legal approaches to copyright generally (even as
between a droit d’auteur and economic rights) so the introduction of a more flexible judge
made set of exceptions is likely to lead to greater rather than less variance between member
states than the current framework.

a problem?

     NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to

Please see the reply to question 21.


     NO OPINION


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]

It is difficult to envisage a framework pursuant to which limitations and exceptions
established at national level could or should have cross border effect.

Where the same limitations and exceptions are available in different member states the
specific implementation of the limitations and exceptions is subject to any scope for variation
from an implementation point of view as between those member states.

With regard to “fair compensation” this is typically a matter that is left to member states’
discretion.

The interpretation and application of limitations and exceptions should be based on the law of
the country where the relevant act in respect of which the scope of the limitation or exception
is being considered. By the same token the value and basis for determining fair compensation
should be based on the country where the harm is done.

It is however important to note that we are not aware in practice of differences between
member states having a material impact on licensing and/or the availability of products or
services within or between different member states.


A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to

rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.        Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other

2.       Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not

institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across

3.       E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including

libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

It is critical to note that one of the significant current success stories in the context of licensed
music services is the growth in recent years in licensed subscription services. It is notable that
the largest of such services is Spotify, one of the few services that has achieved the status of
leading player within its field that has originated in Europe.

An e-lending library model would compete with licensed subscription services.

Libraries operating a lending system based on physical copies are naturally limited in the
scope of their potential impact on the commercial market by (i) the number of copies of each
work and the depth of catalogue that a library can physically accommodate and (ii) the
number and location of users that a library can reach. A multi-territory e-lending initiative for
libraries through anything other than a negotiated licensing solution risks severely distorting
to the market for licensed services.


4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing




                                                                                                  33
BRU5269590/1 PENDING-031860
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible

other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?


     YES – Please explain

The MOU is very specific and sector driven and cannot be extended to music.

Digitization is common for music and the chances of music being both in analogue form and
out of commerce are remote.

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?

D.       Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to

publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

F.       User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?

   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

   NO
As the Licences for Europe UGC working group discovered, it is difficult to provide simple
solutions to every aspect of the many issues that hide under the UGC banner but we believe
the following simple assertions can be made:

+        UGC as a term is often used to refer to any content that may be uploaded by a user and
         shared with other users. In the context of the response to this question we are referring
         to UGC as content which is actually “generated” by the user meaning either content
         that is entirely the original creation of the user (“Original UGC”) or content that is
         derivative of a pre-existing work or pre-existing works but which involves original
         protectable contributions made by the user even of those contributions consist solely
         of combining or altering pre-existing works in a new and original way (“Derivative
         UGC”). In this context UGC does not include content uploaded by users which
         consists simply of a copy of or an extract from a pre-existing work (“User Uploaded
         Content”).

+        Original UGC, Derivative UGC and User Uploaded Content all consist of protectable
         works which are subject to normal copyright principles and in respect of which legal
         enforcement and protection measures should remain available to rightsholders and
         creators even whilst market based licensing solutions are clearly emerging that allow
         for their creation and dissemination to flourish in a way that benefits consumers,
         rightsholders and service providers.

+        A user creating Original UGC is no different to any other creator or rightsholder.
         Their content should not be treated any differently to any other form of copyright
         material purely because it was disseminated via a “UGC” service. UGC platforms
         already allow the creators of Original UGC to control the availability of their Original
         UGC including

         (i)      controlling whether it is commercially exploited (in this context, typically,
                  whether it is monetized), made available without monetisation or removed
                  from the service

         (ii)     controlling whether other users are allowed to re-post it as User Uploaded
                  Content (in other words in its original form)

         (iii)    controlling whether other users are allowed to incorporate it into Derivative
                  UGC



                                                                                               41
BRU5269590/1 PENDING-031860
+        A user creating Derivative UGC is no different to any other creator or rightsholder that
         wishes to create a work which is derivative of another work or other works.
         Derivative UGC is accordingly subject to the usual rights and remedies of the original
         rightsholders whose works are embodied in the Derivative UGC. It does not matter
         whether the rightsholders or creators of the original material or the Derivative UGC
         are professional or non-professional. These rights are important to ensure that the
         original rightsholders’ commercial interests and the creators’ moral rights are
         respected.

+        It is possible for creators of Derivative UGC to seek to secure express approvals and
         agree commercial terms with rightsholders (in the same way that creators of derivative
         works have in the past) but it is testament to the evolution of flexible licensing
         solutions that mass clearance solutions are evolving that allow for the incorporation of
         a huge catalogues of commercial works as well as Original UGC into Derivative UGC
         subject only to the right of rightsholders to:

         (i)      participate in the value created by the Derivative UGC (a concept which has its
                  clear parallels with traditional derivative works); and

         (ii)     object to the use of their works (such objections are rare and are typically
                  limited to situations where the creator of the work or their estate object on
                  moral rights grounds to the quality or context of the Derivative UGC in which
                  their work has been used.

+        Proposing exceptions for Derivative UGC ignores the following issues:

         (i)      Derivative UGC is not a new phenomena – it is a type of use that copyright
                  principles are well equipped to deal. The challenge is scale but scale is a
                  technical and commercial challenge not a legal one. We believe the challenge
                  is being met through the development of market based solutions.

         (ii)     A copyright exception would have a chilling effect on licensing solutions that
                  are in place and evolving which are designed to deal with the scale whilst
                  preserving basic copyright principles.

         (iii)    The vast majority of the making available of UGC is conducted on a massive
                  scale by commercial entities operating for profit so even if, in some cases,
                  individual uploading users may not be viewing their particular activity as a
                  commercial proposition, the usage itself is clearly commercial.

This response is given in the context of licensed services where there is a broad acceptance
that rightsholders of works (derivative or otherwise) should be adequately identified and
remunerated. It remains the case on the composer/songwriter/music publisher side that the
technical processes, systems and databases used for these purposes are better equipped to deal
with producers, individuals or small enterprises than large catalogues or CMO licensing
entities for whom a greater degree of automation is both needed (and possible) to ensure
efficient and consistent results. Solutions intended to deliver such automation are currently

     IV.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?

     NO – Please explain
The scope and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions provided for by
the directive has been the subject of several key clarificatory cases decided by the CJEU
which has been providing clear and detailed guidance as to the scope and application of the
exceptions.

     NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59

     YES – Please explain

To the extent that the copies were private copies made under the exception. In this case such
copies should be distinguished from copies which are not private and not subject to the
exception, which copies consist of the copies made in the course of the direct commercial
transaction between a licensed service, and a user during which the digital file is transmitted
to the user.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]

Within the context of online services offered by commercial entities, copies made by those
entities or copies made in the course of those entities providing a service on a commercial
basis to consumers are not private copies and are therefore not within the scope of private
copying as envisaged by the exceptions provided pursuant to the Copyright Directive.

It is clear that notwithstanding the fact that the amount of true private copying has expanded
exponentially with the advent of multiple devices and has created in the process huge value
for device manufacturers and for consumers, the value of the levies in those member states
where they apply has not kept pace with the volume and value of private copying.

59

BRU5269590/1 PENDING-031860
In the context of cloud services or other online services offered to the consumer that result in
copies being made in the context of a commercial relationship, it is not only more appropriate
for those copies to be dealt with through a licensing process but it is also clear from market
developments that a licensing solution is not only desirable but possible as evidenced by
licensing arrangements that are already in place.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?60

     YES – Please explain

We would welcome the provision of information to consumers purchasing products that are
subject to levies that clearly specifies that the device is subject to a levy, the beneficiaries of
the levy and the scope of the private copying exception that accompanies the product.

We would however suggest that research be conducted into the potential implications for the
consumer of separating the value of the levies from the value of the relevant products. From
analysis conducted of device pricing in member states, UK Music concluded that the
existence of levies did not appear to lead to an increase in the price of devices in the member
states where they were subject to the levies, compared with the price in the UK where there
were no levies. It would appear therefore that the consumer price is determined more by
market forces and competition than input costs such as levies. It remains to be seen whether
separating out the cost of the levies from the cost of the product may result in an increase in
the final aggregate price to consumers.

     NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?

71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]


We would welcome the creation of a process whereby the basis for calculation, the method
for collection/enforcement and the scope of products that are subject to the levy system across
member states is reviewed regularly. This would need to take into account the judgments of
the CJEU and any legal or technological developments with the aim of proposing to member
states areas of potential harmonisation whilst preserving the principle that the value and scope
of the levies is a matter to be determined by member states in respect of sales of products
taking place in their countries.


                                                                                             47
BRU5269590/1 PENDING-031860
We are concerned that the UK government appears committed to introducing a private
copying exception without fair compensation for rightsholders and that such an exception
would be contrary to European Law.


     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?


[Open question]

We do not believe that it is possible through a process of legislative intervention to ensure that
any stakeholder receives adequate remuneration or fair compensation in any context.
Legislation can however help foster situations where the right outcome is more rather than
less likely to be the result. In the context of authors, performers or any rightsholders we
would propose that the following interventions would have the following results:

+          The introduction of exceptions to copyright or the weakening of rights that currently
           vest in rightsholders:

           Such interventions are the most likely to lead to lower remuneration for authors,
           performers and rightsholders. If the objective is to improve rather than damage the
           remuneration prospects for authors, performers and rightsholders any weakening of
           copyright should be resisted.

BRU5269590/1 PENDING-031860
+        The introduction of a mandatory system of unwaivable equitable remuneration which
         is managed via collective representation in relation to certain rights:

         An intervention that would prevents authors, performers or rightsholders from entering
         into freely negotiated agreements with third parties in a competitive context pursuant
         to which they contract to license or assign their rights on the commercial basis they
         deem most appropriate, may seem attractive as means to protect them from an
         unscrupulous market. However, ultimately such a solution would have the following
         shortcomings:

         (i)      The administration of these relevant rights would fall to national CMO
                  organisations whose entitlements would be enshrined in law. The result would
                  be a reduction in competition from an author, performer or rightsholder
                  perspective and accordingly less incentives and flexibility in the market to
                  deliver improvements or innovation (including in the context of multi-territory
                  licensing solutions).

         (ii)     Unwaivable entitlements to remuneration managed via mandatory collective
                  solutions would eliminate the ability for authors, performers or other
                  rightsholders to engage in new licensing solutions in those areas that are
                  mandated to the collective. Whilst the existence of licensing solutions such as
                  Creative Commons and so called “buy-out libraries” are disruptive to some
                  players (including Sony ATV), we believe it is always appropriate for authors
                  and rightsholders to be entitled to seek to pursue whichever solution is most
                  appropriate for their circumstances in a competitive context. Encouraging
                  innovation and creating competition ultimately leads to improvements that
                  benefit all stakeholders.

         (iii)    It would be wrong to assume that collective representation solutions are
                  intrinsically more likely to deliver improvements for authors and performers in
                  terms of value for their rights or transparency or quality of services or the
                  availability of investment against potential revenues from their creations.

In summary we believe that any intervention that is designed to pre-determine the way in
which authors, performers or rightsholders are to engage in mandating or licensing their rights
or the basis on which they are to be remunerated, is likely to ossify licensing structures and
business models as opposed to encouraging innovation and competition and as such is
detrimental to the interests of all stakeholders.

     VI.     Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

     YES – Please explain
It is difficult to distinguish clearly between infringements of copyright committed with a
commercial purpose and other infringements particularly in the online environment where
activities which may superficially appear not to be commercial, actually create significant
commercial value for certain stakeholders. We do not therefore consider the distinction to be
helpful. In the context of civil enforcement it is important to note that the majority of creators
and rightsholders are SME’s and therefore cannot hope to access enforcement systems unless
the cost, time and complexity associated with them is reduced.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]


We would welcome a clarification of the “Mere Conduit” or “Hosting” exceptions to reduce
the scope for arguments to be made that they extend to services which are clearly more than
“dumb pipes”. Generally, it would be beneficial to the long term sustainability of the online
ecosystem for all participants including intermediaries to be encouraged to act responsibly
and to consider carefully whether their activities may be directly or indirectly contributing to
piracy, breaches of data protection or privacy and/or other illegal or fraudulent activities.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?

   YES – Please explain
The protection of copyright, privacy and personal data are all critical ingredients for a
sustainable digital economy. These protections are not intended to shield individuals from
responsibility for their actions. With rights come responsibilities and accordingly an
individual’s right to privacy should no more shield them from liability for copyright
infringement than from liability for data protection breaches.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.


                                                                                             51
BRU5269590/1 PENDING-031860
78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
      YES


      NO


      NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]


Whilst the principle of a single EU copyright title may appear attractive in the abstract, it
suffers from fundamental deficiencies in any practical analysis. These deficiencies include:
(i)         The current worldwide repertoire is structured around existing principles of territorial
            copyright ownership. Unless the introduction of a single copyright title is
            accompanied by a draconian re-allocation or elimination of territorial rights acquired
            contractually the introduction of a single EU copyright title would lead to a two track
            approach which would remain in place for decades and therefore create greater
            complexity in the market.
(ii)        Licensing infrastructure is in many cases national because it has developed to meet the
            specific needs of a local market. Rightsholders would not and should not be expected
            to entrust pan European rights to representatives who do not have the capacity to offer
            adequate pan European services. These concepts are recognised in the CRM
            Directive. The result of the introduction of a pan European copyright title would
            therefore likely include the gradual reduction in the scope of repertoire represented by
            many national collective rights management organisations reducing the scope for
            market based solutions designed to meet the needs of national services.
