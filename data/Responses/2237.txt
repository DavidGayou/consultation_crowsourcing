     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)
As libraries provide a public access to the internet to the general public many users complain
that they cannot access some content, the most common complaint being the inability to view
some video materials on YouTube because the content has not been licensed in Latvia.
     NO
     NO OPINION


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
In our opinion the best way to tackle the cross-border availability of digital services would be
by harmonizing the current copyright legislation so as to enable effective availability of cross-
border services in all the EU Member States without overburdening both rightholders and
users with necessity to licence works for use separately in each Member State.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples

  NO

6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
        – Please explain by giving examples

  NO OPINION


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  YES – Please explain
It can be argued that in order to enable a more effective clearing of rights, including cross-
border licensing, centralized (national, regional or EU-wide) electronic registries of works and
rights clearance centres should be set up, as it is currently being done in the UK.


                                                                                               9

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of

16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               10
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)
Most of the national libraries in the EU are tasked with the preservation of web content or
web harvesting by legal deposit laws. While legal deposit laws typically apply to the
publications published in the given country – this is certainly true for Latvian legislation on
legal deposit – it is currently not clear if the law should be applied to the web pages “targeted”
for Latvian citizens which are made available outside the upper level national domain .lv,
hosted outside Latvia and/or developed/maintained by citizens of another country than Latvia.
If the directive would explicitly define the “targeting” principle of the making available right,
it would most certainly lessen this uncertainty.
     NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                              11
2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
The application of two separate rights to the same work for the same use definitely creates
much confusion as well as very practical problems, for example in the context of legal deposit
and preservation of materials made available online. If web harvesting is not included in the
legal deposit mandate of the national library, it cannot download works made freely available
for a public consultation online without an explicit consent of the rightholder for preservation
purposes as preservation exceptions typically do not cover works not in the institutional
collection.

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why

   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
Just as we believe that the link itself cannot be considered a creative work and therefore
cannot be protected by copyright we also believe that a link to a work cannot be considered to
be an act of communication of a work as the act of publishing of the link to a work in no way
substitutes an actual making available of the work. More importantly, from a practical point
of view it has to be recognised that if linking to works would fall under the right of
communication to the public and therefore be a licensable activity, it would break the internet
as we know it and create enormous social and economical losses. Therefore URLs should not
be an object of copyright, just as their physical counterparts – for example, library catalogue
records – are not.

any temporary acts of reproduction would become subject of authorisation.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,

  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to

                                                                                                              13
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

C.       Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

licensing of works and other subject matter?

emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).
29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             14
16.    What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
A registration system would introduce a greater legal certainty and clarity for both
rightholders and users of works as it would make it much easier to establish if something is
protected by copyright or not and to find the rightholders of a specific work. If properly
implemented a centralized registry system of works and rights clearance centre would make
the licensing process less burdensome for licensees, making it much easier and cheaper to
identify the rights status of the work and the owner of the rights. At the same time it would
limit the appearance of future orphan works and would also give a more accurate overview of
creativity and culture in the EU. In order to increase the legal certainty the registry should
ideally include not only the in-copyright and in-commerce works but also in-copyright and
out-of-commerce works, works licensed with open licenses, orphan works and public domain
works.
Ideally the solution should also facilitate obtaining the license and paying for it, as well as
facilitate an automated licensing of works. To this end the solutions has to be made machine-
readable in order to enable integration between information systems used by both rightholders
and users, for example, to automatically obtain the information on licence conditions of works
in digital content stores and service platforms. For the registry design to be effective it should
be designed based on input from all the stakeholders, including rights users, and should be
built on top of all the existing data currently available to all the stakeholders.


17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
It has to be acknowledged that a registration system will require some an extra effort from
rightholders. It can also potentially make the process of rights clearance actually more
burdensome than it is now, for example, if system introduces unreasonable requirements for
users or simply is badly designed and implemented. For example, if memory institutions
would be required to register all the uses of all the digitised works in the registry it would
create an extra administrative burden for memory institutions, especially in a case the registry
system lacks decent interoperability with other systems. To avoid this pitfall it is of utmost
importance to ensure the interoperability of the system with other systems which contain the
information on works and it rightholders such as national bibliographies, ISBN data bases and
RRO registries to promote as streamlined creation and use of data as possible. As noted in
answers to further questions, a sound system of unique identifiers of both works and
rightholders are also extremely important both to the quality of data in registry and the ease of
its use.


18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
The best way to incentivise the uptake of such registry would be by creating a clear economic
benefit of using such a system. Therefore the design of the system should be created mainly
with the needs of those rightholders who are actively interested in a commercial exploitation
of their works (which, it might be argued, is by far the smallest group of all the rightholders)
in mind.


                                                                                               15
Of course, the set of incentives will also derive directly from the overall design of the
copyright framework. While it is recognised that the international copyright law explicitly
prohibits any formality as the condition on which the rights are established, it could be
established that for some specific actions, especially regarding the enforcement of rights,
registration of works is necessary. For example, registration might be required for a
rightholder to start an enforcement action or to collect royalties through the CMO. If at any
point n the future a shorter term of copyright protection would be introduced, for example, a
term of 20 years after the creation of work, a registration of the work in the registry could be
mandatory to extend the term after the initial 20 years of protection.
Even in the current framework of copyright it can be assumed that there will be enough
incentives to use the registry system as the inclusion of works in the registry will likely foster
the discoverability and actual use of works, as well as lessen the administrative burden of
rightholders making it much easier and cheaper to license their works.



D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
EU should actively support the development and adaptation of identifiers, for example, by
financing best-practice networks through EU programmes, including Horizon 2020. As
librarians we can confirm that in order to create a database for precise identification of works
good and widely adapted identifiers are a must. It can be assumed that libraries would be
happy to assist the EC in the process of creation of a stable framework of identifiers by

31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

submitting the national resources used for unique identification of published materials such as
national bibliography data, ISBN, ISSN and ISMN data, national thesaurus and other
controlled vocabularies, as well as sharing the existing know-how librarians have developed
throughout years of creating and managing the data.
As stated above in answers about the registry of works, for identifiers to be as effective as
possible we strongly believe that the system of identifiers should be based on open standards
and interoperable, preferably built on top of already existing and widely adapted and
maintained identifiers used by stakeholders in real-life scenarios.



E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
We believe that current terms of copyright protection are no longer adequate in the face of
how nature of creativity, self-expression and publishing has changed during last few decades.
We support the opinion that the current term of protection is too long, especially when
compared with the average commercial life of many of the objects that can be found in the
collections of memory institutions. In practical terms the long term of protection prevents
memory institutions from fulfilling their public interest mission and making available the
works in their collections which no longer are in commercial use available to society for a
disproportionate amount of time. As a result much of the 20th century material that is held by
these institutions currently is hidden behind the physical and virtual walls of these institutions.
Therefore we believe that the duration of copyright protection must be reduced to enhance
access to knowledge and culture much more quickly and to reduce the problems (such as
orphan works) that surface when rightholders do not actively exploit their works. In this light
15 to 25 years after the first publication, extendable for as long as the material is being
commercially used, seems a more proportionate duration.

However it has to be acknowledged that it is the international law on copyright not the EU
regulations that governs the minimum terms of copyright protection. Considering that both
terms for copyright and related rights currently is 20 years longer than required by the
international agreements, we support the opinion that the terms should be shortened back to
50 years after the death of the author and 50 years after the first performance as required by
the international agreements.

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
36
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            18
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
The optional nature of limitations and exceptions to the copyright means that there is virtually
no harmonization of exceptions in the EU. Even if an exception is implemented it might be
implemented in drastically different ways thus rendering an activity which is perfectly legal
under an exception in one country an infraction in another country. It makes the cross-border
use of works very problematic. For example, it can be argued that it would be illegal to
advertise an exhibition of Latvian artist in Estonia without consent of the artist, since Latvian
copyright law does not have the exception for use of works for the purpose of advertising the
public exhibition of artistic works, although the Estonian copyright does have this exception.
The preservation exception in the UK has been implemented in a much narrower way than the
2001/29/EC directive suggests and compared to other EU Member States. This creates an
uneven playing field for memory institutions in different Member States, for example in the
latter case it creates considerable administrative expenses for copyright clearance for memory
institutions in the UK, and/or limits the number of heritage objects preserved thus putting
bigger proportion of national heritage under risk. Meanwhile memory institutions in other
countries, for example Latvia, who do not face such restrictions, are in much favourable
situation. This creates a dangerous situation that in some Member States the common
European cultural heritage is taken better care of than in the others; in turn, discrepancies
between possibilities to make available the digitised works in different Member States creates
a distorted overall view on the common European cultural heritage.

In our opinion at least all the exceptions that relate to education, learning and access to
knowledge should be mandatory and harmonized across all the EU Member States. As
described above the current situation where exceptions are not harmonized creates a lot of
uncertainty, renders some uses which are legal in one country illegal in another country and
seriously impedes the cross-border collaboration of memory and educational institutions and
the circulation of knowledge in the society.

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
In our view no existing limitations and exceptions should be removed from the directive.
However some new exceptions have to be introduced, including an exception for text and data
mining for all research purposes; an exception to ensure that nothing in a contract undermines
limitations and exceptions in copyright law; an exception enabling e-lending in libraries; an
exception mandating that publicly funded research results should be made openly available
regardless of contracts signed with a publisher; a new preservation exception allowing for
operation of national and international preservation networks between institutions; a new
research exception making no distinction between commercial and non commercial purposes;
a reworked exception allowing for an effective mass-digitisation in libraries, museums and
archives and effective cross-institutional and cross-border access of digitisation results.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
The current framework of limitations and exceptions in the EU law is very tightly defined and
prescriptive. Therefore some more built-in flexibility in the legislative framework would be
advisable, particularly given the very slow pace of legislative change and very quick
technological change. A good starting point would be to introduce a new general open-ended
exception or a fair dealing exception, compatible with the three step test, as detailed in the
answer to the next question.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
To provide more flexibility to the legal framework in general and exceptions in particular it
would be advisable to implement a kind of an open-ended fair dealing provision. The
advantage of this approach is that it would provide more legal certainty to the users of works,
particularly for memory institutions who currently operate in a patchwork of legal provisions
and exceptions, which sometimes can make two very similar activities (for example, web
harvesting and download of a publication made freely available on the internet) one legal and
the other illegal. A fair dealing provision which would allow to justify the use of works based
on intents and purposes of the use might help to remedy this situation, as showcased by the
recent ruling of the US Court in the Google Books case, in which it was recognised that
digitization of books confirm to the fair dealing provisions.
On the other hand it has to be recognized that a fair dealing provision at the same time could
somewhat lessen the legal certainty for rightholders and also introduce an additional burden to
the courts on which the duty to recognise if the use has been fair or not will inevitably fall.
However we believe that the added flexibility of the copyright should have enough
advantages to offset the potential shortcomings and ultimately make the European copyright
system fitter for innovation and increase the competitiveness of European business, research
and culture.

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
While the preservation exception in Latvian legislation is defined in rather broad terms – it
does not exclude any type of institutions or works from the range of institutions or works to
which the exception applies, and does not limit the number of copies which can be made for
preservation purposes, it still has its limitations. The most notable limitation is that it applies
only to the works in holdings of preservation institutions, which makes it impossible to apply
it for born digital works published online.
While the legal deposit tasks the National Library to perform the web harvesting and allows
obtaining copies of works published online, it does not give a clear permission to create
preservation copies of works which can be obtained only on grounds of a license. This issue
has been recently highlighted by a case when one of leading publishers in Latvia refused to
submit the legal deposit copies of e-books, arguing that in their opinion e-books do not

                                                                                                22
correspond to the definition of online publication provided by the legal deposit law. If there
was a clear exception providing that legal deposit libraries have a right and obligation to
obtain a copy of all online publications according to the preservation exception this discussion
most likely wouldn’t have taken place. The exception also does not include adaptation of
works, which is necessary to perform the co-called format-shifting of works to ensure their
compatibility with current technologies.
The current wording of the preservation exception permits making copies only of out-of-
commerce works, which doesn’t allow for an effective preservation of born digital works,
which, it can be argued, never go out of-of-commerce, unless pulled from the web site of the
publisher. It also allows only for copying of works in the collections of institutions, which
does not allow for preservation of born digital works published on internet of interest to
certain institutions, for example research libraries and museums, apart from legal deposit
libraries.
A problem the research libraries face is the inability to obtain permanent copies of digital
materials made available on subscription basis. Currently such right can be obtained
exclusively by licensing as these works fall outside the preservation exception for a number of
reasons, not the least because of the territorial nature of the exception, providing that only
works published in the territory of Latvia can be reproduced; another reason why these works
cannot be preserved is that they do not form a part of library’s collection and are available
commercially. However if these works are pulled from the subscription package while there
still is a demand for these materials from researchers and students it creates a negative impact
on research and educational capacity of the institution.
Finally, the current territorially fragmented framework of preservation exceptions does not
allow for effective cross-border collaboration. As the digital preservation is a very resource
consuming task, which requires building of an advanced technical infrastructure and training
of high level experts in digital preservation, it would make sense, for example, to establish
international centres for digital preservation where developing a national centre of digital
preservation would prove impractical and costly, for example, for all the three Baltic states.
An even better solution would be to create an effective network of European legal deposit
libraries network for digital content, which would be fully in line with the Commission
Recommendations of 2000, 2006 and 2011 for legal deposit and digital preservation.

29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
In our opinion the best solution to the problems described above would be to introduce an
updated, broader and clearer preservation exception in the directive which would remedy the
aforementioned problems and to make it mandatory and thus harmonized all over the EU.


30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]

Instead of only allowing specific acts of reproductions it should allow all acts of reproduction
necessary for publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments, museums and archives
to achieve aims related to their public-interest missions. The updated preservation exception
should make sure it applies equally to all types of institutions engaged in the preservation of
cultural heritage and all types of works considered to be a part of the cultural heritage. It
should be without prejudice of number of copies allowed to be made for the aims of
preservation and should allow also for adaptation of works for preservation purposes. Most
importantly it should – in some separate strictly limited cases, for example research libraries
and legal deposit institutions – allow for the exception to be applied to the works published
online and not in the collections of institutions, including materials made available through
license, materials made available by streaming and materials in-commerce, providing that
preservation copies can be made available only in cases the original material is no longer
made available to the institution. Moreover, it should be established that the preservation
exception cannot be over-ridden by contract terms of licenses.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rightholders that enable you to provide
remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes
of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
One of the problems with making available the digitised collections of libraries should be at
least partially solved by implementation of the Directive 2012/28/EU on certain permitted
uses of orphan works, which will allow making freely available those works recognized as
orphans. It must be noted however that the language of the directive in our opinion is less then

                                                                                             24
optimal for reaching its aim as it will make the diligent search and registration of works and
their uses very resource intensive and burdensome for libraries, thus practically inapplicable
for the processes of mass digitization and for clearing of complex works where a big number
of rightholders have to be identified and reached. Latvia has also been fortunate to be
involved in the ARROW+ project which develops both infrastructure and best practice for
clearing rights for digitization and making available of digitized works, however it cannot be
expected that libraries of Latvia will be able to start reaping the benefits of the system
implemented during the project anytime soon, mainly because the Books in Print and RRO
data bases have been created only during the project and therefore lack the critical amount of
data to be of any use for the purpose of rights clearance. However all of this will create at
least some legal certainty about the permitted uses of some types of works, even if it will be
hardly used in practice.
The main problem however remains that there essentially is no way in Latvia at this point to
obtain the permission of rightholders to make works available off-premises. The National
Library of Latvia mainly digitises older works published between 1870 and 1970 which are
no longer available commercially, including newspapers. While most of these works are still
in copyright there often is no reasonable way to find and reach the rightholders as a lot of
them are not the original authors but their descendants and the rights are not represented by a
CMO, which means that the library has to contact the rightholders directly. While these works
might in theory be considered orphaned it could however be argued that the search of
rightholders has not been diligent enough. The situation is especially grave regarding
newspapers – there are no legal entities which could be considered the publisher for
newspapers published from 1918 to 1989, therefore it can be argued that each author of each
article and photograph should be contacted in order to obtain a permission to make their
works available, which is of course impossible. However there is also no reasonable way of
recognising these works as orphans as the requirements for the diligent search would require
the identification of all the authors beforehand.
It would in theory be possible to ask the CMO of author’s rights for a blanket licence or some
variation of extended collective licensing scheme. Currently there are no provisions in the
legislation which would mandate them to grant such a licence therefore it is anyone’s guess if
they would actually be willing to grant such a licence as it would undoubtedly require a
tremendous amount of effort to identify and approach the right holders currently not
represented by the CMO. On the other hand if the rightholders would be expected to approach
the CMO themselves for remuneration it is feared that the most of remuneration would
actually fall in wrong hands, respectively, distributed among the authors represented by the
CMO who might have nothing to do with the works licensed by this blanket license. It should
be understood that Latvia is a rather new state with comparatively recent traditions in
collective rights management, therefore it can be argued that most of authors active during the
first Republic of Latvia (1918-1939) and during the time of Soviet, German and again Soviet
occupations (1939-1991) might not have been active during the period of second Republic of
Latvia (1991-currently) and therefore have not their rights represented by a CMO, which
considerably complicates clearance of their rights.
On a more general level we consider that it is unpractical and against the principles of free
access to information to lock up the materials not in-commerce only on premises of the
institution which has performed the digitization. This exception is extremely limited and
doesn’t meet the expectations of modern citizens used to always-on access to information.
While it might be argued that a wide availability of those materials in libraries could deter a
repeated introduction of those works in commerce, in practice most of those works are of
ephemeral interest to wide audiences and therefore of limited commercial interest – old

                                                                                            25
newspapers being the best example. Moreover, for some types of institutions, notably
museums, the current wording of the exception is ill fitted to the nature of their operation as
no user can reasonably expect to be seated at the designed terminal for consultation of
digitised works in the premises of a museum; however these works most probably can be of
significant interest to the users of libraries and educational institutions.
Finally is must be noted that the current exception all but makes impossible an effective
consultation of in-copyright but out-of-commerce works across the borders of EU Member
States thus severely limiting the possibilities to introduce citizens of EU to the common
European cultural heritage.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
We propose a legislative solution by expanding the current provisions of the making available
exception and making it mandatory and thus harmonized all over the EU Member states,
moreover, licences and contracts should not be able to override this exception.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]

The updated make available exception should allow for a significantly wider access to the
digitised works which are in-copyright but out-of-commerce. Ideally it should encompass all
non-commercial uses and provide that all works which are out-of-commerce cab be freely
made available for a public access on internet, provided that rightholders are adequately
remunerated for the use (potentially only in cases if the work has been registered with the
registry of works) and there is an opt-out clause for those rightholders who do not want their
works to be accessible.
It has to be understood that this doesn’t automatically mean a free access to everything
explicitly excluding the works currently in-commerce, including works available on basis of
licensing. Provided there are sufficient safeguards in place to guarantee that the actions of
memory institutions does not interfere with the normal commercial exploitation of works it is
unlikely that broadening of this exception would in any way upset the lawful economic
interests of rightholders while providing an enormous benefit to whole society. In fact it has
been witnessed that many authors are happy that their works are kept “alive” through the
digital collections of cultural institutions, therefore it is unlikely that authors not actively
exploiting their works for commercials ends would object to making available of their works.
However current legislative framework requires memory institutions to license each such use,
and even if the license is free the process of licensing create a significant administrative
burden for memory institutions.
At the very minimum the updated make available exception should provide that all the works
digitized by the memory institutions in the EU can be accessed in any library, museum,
archive and education institution of the EU, thus establishing an effective framework for
cross-institutional and cross-country accessibility of the common European cultural heritage.
If thusly worded the new make available exception would still maintain that the digitized
materials are available on premises of libraries, archives, museums and educational

                                                                                             26
institutions by dedicated terminals to individual members for research and private study, but
get rid of the limitation that the institution itself should have digitized those materials. Such a
language of the exception should also introduce the minimal technical requirements for
transfer of the digitized materials so that they are not available outside the dedicated terminals
of the institutions, for example necessity for authorisation and use of secure networks.
However any lesser solution would be a waste of enormous amounts of public money
invested into digitization so far and would be against the public interest mission of memory
institutions to make the knowledge available to the society.

3.       E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rightholders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain with specific examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
Both libraries and publishers in Latvia currently have a very limited experience dealing with
e-books. E-book market has gained some traction only in the last couple of years and there are
only a couple of cases of libraries experimenting with acquisition and lending of e-books.
There currently is only one somewhat sizeable example of e-lending in public libraries in
Latvia, where a public library in one the biggest cities of Latvia acquired 10 tablet computers
and 200 e-books from the biggest publisher in Latvia as a part of an Interreg project. The
project however can hardly be evaluated as success. This is mainly because the publisher
provided e-books with a license which allows for the consultation of e-books only on
premises of library. As the users of the public library normally expect to obtain books for
reading at home, the e-book service is hardly used.
The National Library of Latvia carried out a project in early 2013 in order to develop a mutual
agreement on the main principles for e-lending in libraries to establish a sound framework of

                                                                                                27
mutual agreement regarding the e-lending between libraries and publishers. As a result of the
project a Memorandum of Agreement and a standard license was developed drawing heavily
from international experience of both IFLA and EBLIDA, and considering the interests of
both libraries and publishers. However while library organizations of Latvia wholly supported
the text of the Memorandum, the publisher organizations refused to sign the document. It
must be noted however that some publishers have expressed an interest to begin
experimenting with models for e-lending, but currently the main obstacle is the lack of
technical infrastructure as neither publishers nor libraries are unable to introduce their own
technical solution for e-lending at this point, as well as any third party.
While we are hopeful that there is a good chance to develop a mutually agreeable best
practice for e-lending which respects the economic interests of publishers and at the same
time doesn’t distort the functions and public mission of libraries, this biggest fear remains that
some of the publishers will just flat-out refuse to license e-books to libraries thus disrupting
the very basics of the way the public libraries function. For their part libraries of Latvia are
ready for a discussion about the best practice of e-lending; for example, while we consider a
limitation which makes a simultaneous use of the same title by many users impractical and
illogical in the age of internet, we accept at the same time that there probably have to be
certain frictions built in the licenses so as not to disrupt the uptake of e-book market and the
business of publishing in general and therefore are prepared for reasonable compromises.
  NO
  NO OPINION

37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
We acknowledge that in the current copyright framework it would be difficult to enforce that
lending of e-books would be managed on the same legal grounds as lending of physical books
therefore for the time being the acquisition and lending of e-books will likely be performed on
the basis of licensing. However we believe that there is a room for a legal solution to make
sure the lawful interests of libraries do not suffer. We propose to introduce a legal solution
which would make sure that all the current exceptions and limitations would apply also to the
works acquired by means of licensing, thus effectively granting libraries the right to copy a
portion of the work, reformat the work for preservation purposes, provide an interlibrary loan
copy, reformat the work to enable print disabled access, and bypass a technological protection
measure for the purpose of exercising any non-infringing purposes. Moreover, the legal
solution should provide that publishers cannot refuse to licence the works to libraries and that
these contracts cannot override the existing limitations and exceptions, in turn rendering any
terms of a contract violating existing limitations and exception null and void.
As an alternative a separate new exception for providing a lawful access for a limited time to
authorised users to e-books and other materials published in a digital form and made available
rather than distributed on a basis of licensing could be introduced.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

                                                                                               28
We believe that the management and availability of physical and online collections should be
guided by the same principles according to the public mandate of libraries. Indeed, we believe
that the introduction of online collections and services allow memory institutions to fulfil their
public mandate to provide access to knowledge and culture much more effectively and marks
the beginning of renaissance for memory institutions as it frees them from many of the
constraints imposed on them by the properties of analogue media and their physical
infrastructure. Therefore physical collections and services and digital collections and services
should be recognized and treated as two equivalent and complementary rather than
contradictory ways of providing library services to the society.
Libraries and other memory institutions will inevitably be required by society to provide ever
broader and richer online services while not compromising the quality and availability of
current services provided in person. However at this point the ability of libraries and other
institutions to offer a wide access to their collections online is being held back by restrictions
imposed on the by the copyright framework which severely limits the potential of memory
institutions and their e-services.

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
From a users’ perspective, there is no difference in these activities, aside from the
convenience of online tools.

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°

                                                                                                           29
40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
   YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
While welcoming the efforts made by the EC to introduce some sensible solution to the
problem of digitization and making available of out-of-commerce works we maintain a
position that the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding cannot reasonably provide such a
solution. As explained in previous answers to questions regarding the making available
exception it is highly doubtful that the CMOs in Latvia would be in position to grant a blanket
licence on the making available of digitized works, as they do not represent the critical level
of authors for such a licence to be effective, and might not have the necessary resources to
effectively manage the distribution of remuneration to the authors not represented by the
CMO.
Therefore we believe that a far more comprehensive approach is needed. This can be achieved
by extending the scope of the exception in article 5(3)n of the Copyright Directive as outlined
in the answer to question 34 above. Doing this would provide Europe's cultural heritage
institutions a clear legal framework for operating in the digital environment that would allow
them to make their collections available online, which is where citizens rightfully expect them
to be. It can be argued that wider options to apply the principles of extended collective
licensing could also potentially remedy these problems.

other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
   YES – Please explain
As the cultural heritage is embodied in a wide variety of physical and also digital carriers, not
only printed materials, the guiding principles for digitization and making available of cultural
heritage should apply to all types of materials held by memory institutions. As mentioned
above, a lot of problems regarding digitisation, preservation and making available of cultural
heritage works could be solved by introducing a more general and inclusive exceptions
regulating the work of memory institutions.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain
The biggest problem of the current wording of the teaching exception deals only with use of
works in classrooms, but not virtual learning environments. These problems will considerably
worsen with a wider introduction of MOOC environments.
     NO
     NO OPINION

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
It is necessary to implement a broader and mandatory teaching exception which would not
limit the use of works only to classrooms.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
There are currently no such mechanisms in Latvia.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?

resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
The current implementation of this exception does not allow to effectively manage the cross-
border availability of works adapted for needs of visually impaired people, for example, to the
members of Latvian community abroad Latvia.
     NO
     NO OPINION


51.       If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
The exception should be made mandatory; moreover, the Marrakesh Treaty should be adopted
by the EU as soon as possible to begin a wider process of its international implementation.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.



51
  For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
  YES – Please explain
Currently there is no legal certainty about the possibility to perform text and data mining on
copyrighted content. Acknowledging that both reproduction and adaptation to some degree
are necessary in order to perform text and data mining it can be assumed that within the
current legislative framework these activities therefore should be licensable. However we
believe that such a provision impedes research and innovation, creates unnecessary
administrative burden on universities and in the end puts the European research sector in a
competitive disadvantage compared to countries where text and data mining is covered by an
exception.
  NO – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO OPINION

54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
In our opinion the best solution for this problem would be to create a new mandatory
exception allowing text and data mining, including the licensed content made available to
research institutions on basis of subscription and the content openly available on the internet,
for non-commercial and commercial research. It is hard to imagine that rightholders would
suffer any damages if such exception would be put in place, however the positive influence of
the competitiveness of research sector and, as a consequence, on the whole society could
potentially be tremendous.


55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
The exception should apply to both non-commercial and commercial research institutions and
should allow for reproduction and adaptation of works under copyright, including content
made available to them on basis of subscription, purchased or obtained from public sources of
information on the internet, to create the data infrastructure necessary for text and data mining
and to perform the analysis itself, as long as the work or any parts of the work are made
available to the public in an amount bigger than necessary to make available the results of the
research. Contracts and TPMs should not override this exception. Such an exception should


                                                                                              35
also not differentiate between commercial and non-commercial activities as such a
differentiation is not in the public interest.

56.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
[Open question]
It can be argued that the methods of text and data mining could be used much more
extensively in research. Besides legal problems we believe that the lack of infrastructure and
know-how contributes to the slow uptake of these methods. Therefore we propose that best-
practice networks and other projects supporting the development new research methods and
research infrastructure in the field of digital humanities and other fields of research using the
methods of text and data mining should be supported and financed by EU programs, including
Horizon 2020.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
53
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           36
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

     IV.       Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.

                                                                                             38
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?

     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role

of intellectual property rights.

   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.

of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
As the public libraries are often the only option for internet access to those who have no other
means to access the internet and thus are performing the vital social function of ensuring a
free access to the information as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
they can be considered an intermediary and therefore held liable of any of the users of the
public internet service has been involved in copyright infringement using this service. We
firmly believe that this should not be the case and that intermediaries such as libraries should
not be held liable for action of their users provided they have applied the minimum of
measures necessary to prevent infringements. However these measures have to be considered
very carefully, and as the libraries have traditionally taken a strong stance against censorship
and for the freedom of expression and communication, we believe that any measures that limit
these freedoms are unacceptable.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
We believe that the current copyright framework, including the enforcement framework, is
heavily tilted towards the interest of rightholders and does not fully take into account the
lawful interests of the society. The current framework of exceptions is a perfect example of
67
  This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                         43
this. We firmly believe that the copyright framework should not operate on the basis of
assumption that every use which is not strictly prescribed by the copyright legislation is
therefore illegal; it should be based on assumption that every use which is not explicitly
deemed illegal by the enforcement framework is legal and allowed. In this context we believe
that an introduction of a fair dealing provision in the EU copyright framework would be very
useful and would provide a safe harbour for uses which do not directly and intentionally harm
the legal economic interests of rightholders, taking into account the intent and scope of the
use.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
  NO OPINION
While there are a number of areas, as indicated above, which would greatly benefit from a
greater harmonisation, namely a number of exceptions regarding the use of works for cultural,
educational and research ends should be harmonised and made mandatory to improve their
effectiveness and cross-border application, we are unsure whether a single EU Copyright Title
would be the best solution for all the copyright related issues.


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]
The most immediate action should be a revision of the Information Society Directive to
include additional exceptions and make existing exceptions mandatory in order to harmonise
those exceptions across the Member States.

VIII.     Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important

matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
