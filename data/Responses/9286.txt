      Introduction

Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders‟ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

       Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A.    Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in
Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

        to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?

or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

A distinction has to be made in this regard between the so called world music repertoire
(which Buma/Stemra receives through its reciprocal agreements with its sister societies
throughout the world and) which Buma/Stemra (in principle) is able to license within the
Netherlands and Buma/Stemra‟s own direct (Dutch) repertoire assigned by its members,
which it (in principle) Buma/Stemra can license throughout the world.

Dutch owners of websites, that seek to expand their activities across the borders of the
Netherlands, ask us sometimes to provide a multi-territorial license for use of the world
repertoire outside of the Netherlands. Buma/Stemra cannot honour these requests. First of all
Buma/Stemra is unable to license the repertoire of all its sister societies on a multi-territorial
basis on the basis of the reciprocal agreements. If Buma/Stemra would like to license the
world repertoire, it would have to request a lot of sister societies on an individual basis to do
so. Secondly, following the Recommendation of the Commission (2005/757) a lot of large
rightholders (amongst which large Anglo-American publishers) have withdrawn their
repertoire from Buma/Stemra‟s management, insofar as it concerns the licensing of „multi-
territorial (or: the bigger) services‟. This means that in the event that a Dutch website expands
its activities to other countries, Buma/Stemra can no longer license the repertoire of those
rightholders. Also not for the Netherlands. So in practice, if such a website indeed becomes
active in other countries than the Netherlands (for instance also Belgium and Germany),
Buma/Stemra will only be able to license its own direct (Dutch) repertoire transferred by its
members in those countries.

As regards large international service providers (e.g. Spotify, iTunes etc.); they are usually
well aware of the issues in the European music licensing landscape and are familiar with the
fact that we are only able to license our own direct repertoire to them on a multi-territorial
basis. Given the technical complexities Buma/Stemra, until now, only grants a license for the
Netherlands. This will change before the January 1, 2015. They are able to receive the
licenses they need. You should also take into account that most service provider have a roll
out on a country per country basis.
The new Directive on collective management of copyright and related rights and multi-
territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online uses in the internal market (CRM
directive) adresses these issues in title III.


 4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
    would be the best way to tackle them?
The possible problems are being addressed in the CRM Directive and Buma/Stemra is of the
opinion that the EU legislative framework of copyright does not constitute any problems in
terms of availability and portability of services across the EU. Buma/Stemra also believes that
collective management and voluntary aggregation of rights at CMOs is the most effective way
to address rights clearance related part of cross-border availability and portability of creative
content services. Nevertheless it is important to safeguard the fact that the local repertoire of
the smaller- and medium sized CMO‟s should not be threatened at the bigger picture.
The other thing which should also be taken into account is that it is also important that de
service providers take some of the burden of the technical complexities. Providers of services
in more than one country are not able to provide us with one report detailing the usage in

                                                                                                 9

Europe.. Therefore they deliver reports for each country for each possible license they supply.
For example, when a service provider sells four different types of services, such as Ad
supported, Desktop, Mobile, Premium Mobile in the 27 European states, they send 12 times 4
times 27 = 1296 reports per annum. For CMO‟s this is not a (cost)efficient process..
Furthermore, high levels of piracy and unauthorised use of protected works discourage new
players from investing in the market. This is something the EC as regulator should also
address. Illegal sites like the Piratebay are almost impossible to get from the internet. Please
see also our remarks on this issue later on in our reply


 5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
    there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
    territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
    restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to
    certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?
NO
In the music sector, the rightholders aim to license as many cross border online service
providers as possible. The most efficient way to license is through CMO‟s. Authors‟ societies
in particular seek to offer as many repertoires as possible on the widest possible territory.
However, as also noted under 3, there are an important number of restrictions that have to be
taken into account as regards the repertoire that they individual are able to license. Regarding
the latter we refer to the CRM Directive Title III.


        – Please explain by giving examples
 6.    [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
      why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the
      territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
      restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to
      a different website than the one he is trying to access)?
        – Please explain by giving examples
Because due to a planned marketing strategies a specific roll out per country will be more
successful.




 7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
    led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of
    content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection
    for right holders?
  NO – Please explain


                                                                                                   10

We explicitly refer to the following answer in the reply of Gesac:

“The issue of “cross-border availability of content services at EU level” has been addressed
for many years at EU level through several initiatives of the European Commission, such as
the Content Online initiative, the Online Commerce Roundtable, “Licences for Europe” and
recently the CRM Directive.
Positive developments and best practices have certainly emerged from those exercises, as
briefly presented above and in GESAC‟s contributions to those initiatives at the time. The
market has evolved considerably. In the music sector, for instance, more than 300 legal
services are offering their services throughout the EU territory. CMOs in particular have made
it possible through cross-border licences to enable consumers to enjoy their favourite music
anywhere, anytime and will continue to do so in the framework of the CRM directive. In this
respect, the implementation of the CRM Directive into national laws in such a way as to
support and promote cooperation between CMOs for the delivery of efficient and effective
multi-repertoire and multi-territory licensing would further strengthen this objective.
Therefore, there is no need for further measures at EU level to ensure cross-border availability
of content services.
As to the second part of the question, GESAC regrets that the Commission limits its intention
to ensuring an “adequate” level of protection, since the InfoSoc Directive sets a standard of
“high level of protection”. The InfoSoc Directive‟s standard should remain the starting point
for any consideration by the EU of its copyright policy.
As a reminder, Recital 4 of the directive provides that:
“A harmonised legal framework on copyright and related rights, through increased legal
certainty and while providing for a high level of protection of intellectual property, will foster
substantial investment in creativity and innovation, including network infrastructure, and lead
in turn to growth and increased competitiveness of European industry, both in the area of
content provision and information technology and more generally across a wide range of
industrial and cultural sectors. This will safeguard employment and encourage new job
creation.”
And Recital 9 that:
“Any harmonisation of copyright and related rights must take as a basis a high level of
protection, since such rights are crucial to intellectual creation. Their protection helps to
ensure the maintenance and development of creativity in the interests of authors, performers,
producers, consumers, culture, industry and the public at large. Intellectual property has
therefore been recognised as an integral part of property.”
This is a major issue considering the importance of creation in the EU economy that depends
on a large part on copyright and innovation (about 9.4 million jobs, and 4.2% of the EU GDP
that amounts to almost € 510 billion (source OHIM/EPO 2013)). The 2013 OHIM/EPO study
underlines that IPR-intensive industries account for 90% of the EU's trade with the rest of the
world and copyright is one of the few sectors that has a positive net export value. Protecting
author‟s rights not only ensures European creativity and cultural diversity, but also

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or not)
in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users‟ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act

matter”.

(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
 8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
    content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
  YES
The question in what member states an act of „making available‟ occurs, is indeed a relevant
question, and not, as some might suggest, only relevant in a Private International Law context.
Private International Law provides guidance (among other things) regarding the question
whether a Court is competent to hear a case, but not regarding the question whether an act
should be seen as making available in the sense of the InfoSoc Directive in a particular
member state. Those are two separate issues which, also according to the case law of the ECJ
(see Pinckney par. 40), should be treated separately. First it has to be determined what Court
is competent, and consequently that Court will have to determine whether copyrighted works
are made available in the member state in which protection is sought.
In the De Wolf study it is argued that the law is not sufficiently clear as to the definition of
making available and that this specifically causes problems with regard to the determination
of the material (territorial) reach of the right. Because of this lack of clarity, it is not clear
when the provision of an online service constitutes making available in a particular member
state.
In the De wolf study, several ways to determine the territorial reach of the making available
right are discussed. The different means are divided in two main categories: localisation on
the basis of „Country of Origin‟ (COO) and localisation on the basis of „Exploitation of the
work‟. Both categories are discussed elaborately.
As regards the first category, different ways are discussed to determine the COO, such as
„material act of upload‟ or „place of establishment‟. We are of the opinion that
implementation of a COO system is highly undesirable. As the study also indicates (for
instance on page 137) this will probably lead to „location shopping‟. To anyone slightly
familiar with digital technologies, it is obvious that it is presently very easy to provide an
online service from anywhere in the world and to also make that service accessible anywhere
in the world. It is clear that a lot of online service providers will pick as their COO a country
with a (very) low level of copyright protection which will make it impossible for rightholders
to receive a fair remuneration for the use of their works and to enforce them. If for instance
an act of upload is done in a country where there is no copyright protection (or enforcement)
at all, rightholders will be left completely empty-handed. The upload will not be able to be
licensed and the fact that the relevant website (signal) can be received in the EU, can then also
not be prevented, because there is no act of making available in the EU countries
(accessibility or targeting is not relevant when a COO criterion is applied).
One might argue that application of the COO principle will make the obtainment of the
necessary rights easier in some circumstances (assuming that the relevant service provider is
willing to clear the rights and is situated in a country that offers efficient copyright

however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
                                                                                                     13

protection). However, at least insofar as it concerns, the music industry, a lot (in the future
probably all) of the repertoire will be licensed by the relevant right holders (CMO‟s,
publishers) directly on a pan-European basis to multi-territorial service providers; in other
words no CMO in any country will be able to license the world repertoire to a service
provider (see also the explanation under 3). This means that wherever a multi-territorial
service provider has its COO, he will always have to obtain a licence from all these
organisations. A licence from a local CMO in the COO will never suffice. So it is highly
doubtful that application of a COO principles will really benefit multi-territorial service
providers in this regard. Application of such a principle will only, as noted, make it less likely
that right holders will receive a fair compensation for the use of their works.
The other way to determine where an act of making available occurs is to focus on where the
works are „exploited‟. There has already been some case law of the ECJ which seem to point
in the direction of the application of this principle (such as Sportradar and Pammer/ Hotel
Alpenhof, also discussed in the study) although these cases, strictly speaking, did not concern
the making available right. In short, when this principle is applied, it comes down to the
question whether members of the public are (specifically) targeted in a member state to come
to the conclusion that there is an act of making available in that member state. Under this
criterion it is not sufficient that a work is merely made accessible.
Such an approach would in fact mean introducing a new exception to copyright since it
implies that rightholders cannot avail themselves of their rights in a specific territory if there
is no proof of a subjective intention to target that specific territory, even though members of
the public can access the copyright works from that territory any time they want. You could
argue that this view has also been confirmed by the CJEU in the Svensson case. In that case
the Court has made it clear that in the situation where the works on a website are freely
accessible- i.e. the accessibility hasn‟t been subject to any restrictive measures- the public
targeted by such a website consists of all potential visitors to the site concerned, meaning all
users of the internet in the world (see paragraph 26 of the judgment).
So we believe the Court has already sufficiently clarified that offering a service by which
protected works can be streamed and/or downloaded (or consumed „on demand‟ in any other
way) by members of the public in a particular member state, this in itself suffices to regard
that as making available in the sense of the InfoSoc Directive. Any deviation from this
principle would, as noted, be contrary to basic principles of copyright. It would enable
website owners to make profits in member states without offering a fair remuneration to the
right holders for the use in that state. This does not constitute an unreasonable burden on
online service providers, since it is easy to block the access to their website in specific
member states until they have obtained the necessary licences (as is also done by all major
online music providers, such as iTunes, Deezer, Spotify etc.).

        the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
        whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to
        have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of
        rights (including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
      NO
We refer to the explanations in our answer to Question 8 above. We feel that there are no
practical problems relating to the substance of the right when protected works are used on a
cross-border basis, as the right itself is harmonised at EU level.
Considering that all EU member States and the European Union are party to the Berne
Convention and the fact that the CJEU has to a great extent harmonised the rules on
authorship and originality of the work, the above question raises issues that seem to be only
theoretical and have no practical impact while, on the contrary, the options discussed in the
DeWolf Study could create serious problems in terms of effectively protecting and enforcing
authors‟ rights. We refers in particular to the Country of Origin (COO) principle and the
targeting approach which are not acceptable for the reasons set out in answer to Question 8.




Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.




23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

The fact that, even while there are two rights to a single act of economic exploitation, we are

consumers have access to copyrighted works, liable on the basis of copyright, create a
problem for us. We will get back to that issue later in this reply.


Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

     11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected
         under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
         authorisation of the rightholder?
         YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
       specific circumstances, and why

        The CJEU has very recently handed down its first judgement in the context of the
        question posed (Svensson (C-466/12) adopted on 13 February 2014). It is too soon to
        conduct a full analysis. We refer specifically to the GESAC analysis mentioned
        hereunder.

   the public, the CJEU specified that the provision on a website of clickable links to works
   freely available on another website does not constitute such an act of communication to
   the public. Indeed, if the first condition is fulfilled because the provision of a clickable
   link to a protected work affords a 'direct access' to it and thus constitutes a making
   available within the meaning of Article 3.1 of the Infosoc Directive, the second is not,
   according to the Court. Within the framework of a communication concerning the same
   works as the initial communication and made by the same technical means, the Court
   considers that 'public' refers not only to an indeterminate and fairly large number of
   potential recipients but also to a new public, i.e. a public which was not taken into
   account by the right holders when they authorized the initial communication. The public
   of a website is according to the Court, by definition, unless measures are taken to restrict
   access to its subscribers only, all of the Internet users.

   Such an approach of the notion of public is not obvious insofar as it is possible to
   consider that the Internet users do not form an indistinct whole, the public directed
   towards a protected work thanks to a link provided by a website B being different than
   the public consulting directly such work on a website A. It does not take into account
   neither the reality of the advertising practices which are generally targeted depending on
   the awaited public nor the behaviour of website providers which often seek to draw a new
   public thanks to an optimization of their referral.

   Nevertheless the CJEU took care to specify that the authorisation of the right holders
   remains necessary where the link enables access to a public "which was not taken account
   by the copyright holders when they authorized the initial communication" (paragraph 31),
   which then constitutes a new public compared to that initially taken into account by the
   right holders.

   Thus, the right holders retain the possibility to take measures restricting to a determined
   public access to a website, in which case any link enabling a larger public to access the
   content of such website must be authorized by them. It also follows from the decision that
   links to infringing content, and to sites whose terms and conditions prohibit or place
   restrictions on linking, as well as to sites behind paywalls or with technological
   protection schemes constitute communication to the public.

   Notwithstanding the above and the recent Svensson judgement, please find
   hereunder our opinion on the way linking itself should be regarded.

   The Court in Svensson decided, surprisingly, that even a „normal hyperlink‟ (e.g. a URL,
   displayed in bold text on a webpage) constitutes making available under the InfoSoc
   Directive, but that where a website, and the works thereon, are „freely accessible‟, no
   public that is „new‟ will be reached and the rights of right holders are not affected. This
   result is justified (at least insofar as it concerns such „normal hyperlinks‟), but the
   reasoning that led the to this conclusion is flawed, and leads to unreasonable
   consequences in relation to so-called „embedded‟ and „framed‟ hyperlinks, i.e. hyperlinks
   that give the impression that the work to which the link refers is displayed on the same site
   as the link. The Court concludes that the fact that a work is displayed on a website of
   which the accessibility is not subject to any restrictive measures, means that the public
   „targeted‟ by such a site consists of all potential visitors to the site (every person with
                                                                                               17

   access to the internet). Consequently, the right holders- in the view of the Court- took all
   these people into account when they granted the licence and thus the replacement of their
   content on other websites (via embedded and/or framed links) cannot be separately
   licensed by them.

   This can certainly not be said with regard to embedded and/or framed hyperlinks. It is
   clear that this encompasses more than mere „referencing‟, because it enables website
   holders to present the content (which the link refers to) within the context of the website
   on which the link is placed. The effect of this is very different than in the case of a
   normal/purely referencing hyperlink. The effect of placing such links is exactly the same
   as in the situation where a website owner places files on a website himself (without the
   use of links). The websites who use embedded links have a total different business model
   than their source has and they have their own public (although of course the people can
   partly be the same people as the people who visit the site of the source sometimes as
   well). As the district Court of the Hague in the Netherlands also stated (in the
   Nederland.fm case), the website owner, by placing and bundling such links, creates a „new
   audiovisual product‟ (a criterion from the Airfield judgment) and creates a separate
   possibility to exploit the works that are displayed and to derive a profit from that. For the
   public it will often also not be noticeable that the (technically) originates from another
   website. We believe that it is hard to argue with this reasoning.

   Serious business models have arisen using this embedding technique and the revenues that
   are generated by this, are often also very significant. Some websites for instance offer a
   large amount of embedded Youtube content which they often divide into different
   categories. Examples of this are for instance a website that offers embedded Youtube
   videos of all the songs that are currently in the top 40 (www.in detop40.nl), and a website
   which offers a general catalogue of all kinds of music (www.songa.nl). In all cases the
   effect is the same: a professional music service is created through the categorizing of
   embedded content. But the business model is completely different than the business model
   of YouTube and of course the right owners did not have those websites in mind when they
   licensed YouTube (if YouTube is licensed because as everyone is aware YouTube sees
   itself as a company that can make use of the Safe Harbour provisions). There are similar
   services which (also) use content from other sources, such as „Soundcloud‟ or a
   combination of different sources. In the case of embedding or framing files that contain
   musical works, the added value of the service that is provided is evident.

   The categorizing and embedding of the files takes away a lot of the effort of having to
   look for the relevant files yourself. In theory it is also possible to create a platform which
   offers a selection of music that is just as expansive as the collection of music that can be
   found on platforms such as Spotify and iTunes, the only difference being that Spotify and
   iTunes do not provide their content (at this moment) through embedding. The object of
   using the technique of embedding and/or framing by the DSP as opposed to using normal
   hyperlinks is also evident. It will keep the visitor on the relevant website and allows the
   DSP to generate revenues from advertising.

   Given the above, it is clear that it cannot be assumed that the right holders took all these
   other websites on which embedded files appear into account when granting a license for
   the original website. It is clear that placing embedded links on a website can be seen as a
                                                                                                18

   professional exploitation of the relevant works. Right holders will always seek to license
   every separate exploitation of their works, and therefore it cannot be assumed that they
   took the replacement of their works on other websites „into account‟ when granting a
   licence. It would be a good thing if the European legislator would clarify this.
   The simplest way to look at licensing the internet is that, if you open a website and you
   (can click and) can hear music (supposedly) on that website, you can hold the owner of
   the website (provider) responsible on the basis of copyright no matter what technique is
   being used.



       – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

 12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a
     work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
     memory of the user‟s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
     subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
We refer to the following reply given in the Gesac answers:
“Article 5(1) of the InfoSoc Directive provides that copyright in a literary and artistic work is
not infringed by the making of (1) a temporary copy which is (2) transient or incidental; and
(3) an integral and essential part of a technological process; and (4) the sole purpose of which
is to enable either a transmission of the work in a network between third parties by an
intermediary or a lawful use of the work; and (5) which has no independent economic
significance.
In Infopaq I the CJEU clarified the requirements of Article 5(1) by pointing out that for a
copy to be “transient” it must be deleted automatically in the technological process and
without human intervention. However the Court also stated that “the possibility may not be
ruled out that certain isolated sentences, or even certain parts of sentences in the text in
question, may be suitable for conveying to the reader the originality of a publication such as a
newspaper article, by communicating to that reader an element which is, in itself, the
expression of the intellectual creation of the author of that article. Such sentences or parts of
sentences are, therefore, liable to come within the scope of the protection provided for in
Article 2(a) of that directive” (para. 47).
The decision of the Court was on the concept of “part” of the protected works in terms of 11
words captured and reproduced by Infopaq from the newspaper articles and applicability of
Art 5.1 of the InfoSoc Directive as an exception to that reproduction made by Infopaq.
In the case of website viewing both a part and the whole of a protected work (e.g. a
photograph, a poem, part of a book, etc.) might be displayed on the screen of the device used
                                                                                            19

by the consumer. Recital 33 of the InfoSoc Directive provides some relevant elements on
„browsing‟ after it first explains the conditions of Art 5.1 exception which we already
elaborated above: “(…) To the extent that they meet these conditions, this exception should
include acts which enable browsing as well as acts of caching to take place, including those
which enable transmission systems to function efficiently, provided that the intermediary does
not modify the information and does not interfere with the lawful use of technology, widely
recognised and used by industry, to obtain data on the use of the information. A use should be
considered lawful where it is authorised by the rightholder or not restricted by law.”
It can be concluded that Art 5.1 of the InfoSoc Directive would not apply when those
conditions are not met, for instance when the reproduction on a web-page is not only an
integral and essential part of a technological process but the intermediary interferes with the
use of technology in order to specifically make the protected content available to an end-user
according to data obtained from the user; or the sole purpose of it is not to allow a lawful use
of the work but e.g. to enable an unauthorised making available as presented in our answer to
Question 11; or when such reproduction has an independent commercial value because of the
display of protected works on the website (visual arts, literary works, etc.) against the will of
their rightholders.
The CJEU in its Infopaq II ruling also clarified that the Art 5.1 exception to reproduction
right only applies where the uses
–     fulfil the condition that those acts must constitute an integral and essential part of a
technological process, notwithstanding the fact that they initiate and terminate that process
and involve human intervention;
–     fulfil the condition that those acts of reproduction must pursue a sole purpose, namely
to enable the lawful use of a protected work or a protected subject-matter;
–     fulfil the condition that those acts must not have an independent economic significance
provided, first, that the implementation of those acts does not enable the generation of an
additional profit going beyond that derived from the lawful use of the protected work and,
secondly, that the acts of temporary reproduction do not lead to a modification of that work.
As mentioned earlier the above explanations based on Infopaq I and II rulings were based on
applicability of Art 5.1 exception to reproduction right under certain conditions. Furthermore,
viewing such protected works on website might involve other rights as well. Therefore, it is to
be noted that where viewing of a website or displaying protected works on a website
constitutes a communication to the public and making available under Art 3 of the InfoSoc
Directive, this should also be taken in to account to decide on the applicable rules to the act in
question.”

Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can

also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

     13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
         trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
         – Please explain by giving examples




     14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
         consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously
         purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
We refer in our reply specifically to the answer given in the Gesac reply:
“Application of the exhaustion principle to digital transmissions under the InfoSoc Directive
would have significant economic and legal implications:
1. Economically:
•       since resellers might not destroy originals (which cannot be verified), the very
justification of the application of the principle would be missing and
•       as the resold file is identical to the original, prices for the original files will be driven
down inexorably. There is therefore significant foreseeable harm to authors, publishers and to
online services in terms of the impact on supply and value in the market.
2. The legal basis of such a proposition would also be totally unjustified since:
•       only the distribution right can be subject to exhaustion;
•      the key criterion to determine whether there is reproduction or distribution is the
existence of a fixation of a work on different carriers;
•       downloading necessarily involves the [carrying out of a] reproduction right since a
downloaded work must, upon each download, be fixed on a different carrier. The deletion of
the original file from which the downloads were operated is indifferent to the exercise of the
reproduction right which occurs upon each fixation of the work


28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder‟s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

•       downloading necessarily involves the [carrying out of] communication to public right
since the downloaded work is (i) upon each download, made available to the public so that
anyone can access it from anywhere and at any time he chooses and (ii) transmitted by wire or
wireless means.
•       Therefore reselling of copyright protected works cannot lead to exhaustion, since the
transmission and download necessarily implies a reproduction and a communication to the
public.

We believe that the answer to this question does not require a sector-specific answer (music,
visual arts, audiovisual, etc.) since the exhaustion of rights in digital format is in contradiction
with the protection of copyright and related rights that are recognised under the 2001 InfoSoc
Directive and international conventions.
Whether or not a “copyright work” or “creative content” is subject to the exhaustion principle
is completely related to its material form. Under EU law, the application of the exhaustion
principle in the field of copyright is treated differently depending on the form of the creative
content.
Case law and Directive provisions clearly accept the exhaustion of “distribution right” under
copyright law with the first sale of the physical copies of the product in which the copyright
works are incorporated and that applies to the actual copy sold. That right is exhausted with
regards to the copies distributed once copies of the work are placed on the market with the
consent of the rightholder. This is a community exhaustion and “international exhaustion” and
parallel imports are not allowed, as ruled by the CJEU in its Laserdisken judgement as well.
However, the question of the exhaustion of rights does not arise in the same way where
services rather than goods are supplied. The CJEU has ruled that a rightholder who authorises
one broadcast of a film in one section of the Community territory does not exhaust his rights
over later broadcasts or broadcasts in other parts of the Community and that the sale of copies
of a video cassette does not exhaust the right to authorise or prohibit hiring out, as both
communication to the public and rental are considered as services and there are no actual
copies with regards to which the exhaustion could be applied.
Recital 29 of the InfoSoc Directive has further clarified this issue by saying that: “The
question of exhaustion does not arise in the case of services and on-line services in particular.
This also applies with regard to a material copy of a work or other subject-matter made by a
user of such a service with the consent of the rightholder. Therefore, the same applies to rental
and lending of the original and copies of works or other subject-matter which are services by
nature. Unlike CD-ROM or CD-I, where the intellectual property is incorporated in a material
medium, namely an item of goods, every on-line service is in fact an act which should be
subject to authorisation where the copyright or related right so provides.”
The UsedSoft decision in which the CJEU recently considered application of the exhaustion
principle in case of a download of a computer programme (C-128/11 Oracle v. UsedSoft)
cannot usefully be used as a reference.
First, although the CJEU considered that under certain circumstances the download of a
computer programme can be subject to the exhaustion principle, it also clarified in par. 60
that: “It is true that the concepts used in Directives 2001/29 and 2009/24 must in principle
have the same meaning (see Joined Cases C 403/08 and C 429/08 Football Association
                                                                                                 22

Premier League and Others [2011] ECR I 0000, paragraphs 187 and 188). However, even
supposing that Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/29, interpreted in the light of recitals 28 and 29
in its preamble and in the light of the Copyright Treaty, which Directive 2001/29 aims to
implement (Case C 277/10 Luksan [2012] ECR I 0000, paragraph 59), indicated that, for the
works covered by that directive, the exhaustion of the distribution right concerned only
tangible objects, that would not be capable of affecting the interpretation of Article 4(2) of
Directive 2009/24, having regard to the different intention expressed by the European Union
legislature in the specific context of that directive.”
Then, digital transmissions of copyright protected works involve both the making available
right, which under the InfoSoc Directive is part of the communication to the public, contrary
to what is provided in the Software directive, and a reproduction right.
As regards the making available right, Recital 23 of the InfoSoc Directive specifies that “This
Directive should harmonise further the author's right of communication to the public. This
right should be understood in a broad sense covering all communication to the public not
present at the place where the communication originates. This right should cover any such
transmission or retransmission of a work to the public by wire or wireless means, including
broadcasting. This right should not cover any other acts”.
And Article 3.1 also includes within the communication to the public right “the making
available to the public of their works in such a way that members of the public may access
them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them”.
As evidenced by the preparatory work on the InfoSoc Directive, this inclusion testifies of the
wish of the European legislator to:
-      Implement Article 8 of the WIPO Treaty on Copyright of 20 december 1996;
-      Harmonise the legislation of the Member States on this issue;
-      Include on demand transmission of works in the communication to the public.
As regards the reproduction right, we note that the re-selling of digital files naturally involves
new reproductions of protected works and exhaustion applies only to the distribution of copies
but not to reproductions of protected works. Otherwise the reproduction right would be
completely meaningless. Indeed, the buyer of a re-sold digital file will need to make a new
copy on his/her computer and the online service providing this possibility is very likely to
make a copy in its server as well. Even if the service deleted the copy in the seller‟s device
after the transfer of the file to the buyer, such an act would still create a new and distinct
reproduction of the work in the buyer‟s device without the authorisation of the rightholders
(and also possibly on the server of the service provider).
A case directly about the resale of mp3 music files was recently decided in the US. An online
service called ReDigi offered the possibility to consumers of re-selling the music files bought
from iTunes through its website and dedicated software based on the “first sale” doctrine in
the US. The court decided that the process of moving a digital music file from one hard drive
(the user's computer) to other hard drives (ReDigi's server and, eventually, the buyer's
computer) involves rewriting the file. And this rewriting constitutes unauthorised
reproduction of the copyrighted work. The court found the final number of mp3s that exist
irrelevant, since what copyright concerns is that unauthorised copies were made along the
way. Moreover, because ReDigi also made a new copy in its server to accommodate the resale
of mp3 files through its software, it was also considered that it infringed the distribution right
                                                                                                 23

of copyright owners, since the copy made on the server that allows further resale was not
authorised and the first sale doctrine only applies to “first sales” that are lawfully made.
The provision of EU law is therefore very clear on exhaustion.
However, considering that the question asks to have further views on the possible
consequences of any change to this rule in EU law, the following non-exhaustive list of issues
should certainly be taken into account:
1) It is very clearly regulated in Art 3(3) of the InfoSoc Directive that exhaustion does not
occur in the case of the making available right and in Recital 29 that the question of
exhaustion does not arise in the case of services and online services in particular.
2) The reason to allow exhaustion of rights for physical copies is to be able to determine the
rightful owner (in this case the holder) of the copy for further circulation. Moreover, the
transfer of ownership of the copy in further circulation is a key element of the exhaustion
principle. However in the digital environment, this could only be managed, if it could, by very
well established and effective DRMs, which are progressively proven as being inconvenient
and not functional due to consumer rights and interoperability concerns. Moreover, even
where applied their immediate circumvention on internet makes it in many instances a
pointless effort.
3) The primary problem with the online dissemination of the digital content is not always the
market prices which would be eliminated by second-hand markets, but the sharing that occurs
through P2P networks and BitTorrent platforms for free. Allowing free circulation of creative
content in the single market upon its first sale would practically legalise all those uses on the
Internet (as being a further distribution) which has been called piracy so far. Furthermore,
even if a second-hand market emerges, determination of the legality of the copies, in a
situation where already millions of illicit copies are circulating, would be extremely difficult
and giving the holders of illicit copies the right to sell them would be rewarding piracy.

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

     15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
         licensing of works and other subject matter?
     16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
                                                                                                             24

   17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
   18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


NO, Questions 15 to 18 are answered in this one answer:

A registration system would not be beneficial for rightsholders and users and will very
possibly cause an additional unwanted administrative burden and legal uncertainty.
Is there a problem that needs to be solved?
For rightsholders a registration system would mean a significant increase of the administrative
burden of costs. They would not only have to focus on the creation of their works (sweat from
the brow) but also on the protection of those works. Not only the registration process itself but
also the pressure of keeping the timeframe between the creation and the registration must be
kept as short as possible in order to minimize the risk that someone else would register the
creation first. Also the problem presents itself WHEN (in what phase of “making” the work)
the registration should take place. What happens if in that creation process someone other
than the creator of the song registers the song?
Furthermore a registration system will cause for two different situations to present itself:
works created and registered (protected works) vs. works created but not yet registered. For
users this would present next to the questions who owns what repertoire, in the new copyright
landscape as a result of The Directive on Collective Rights Management, the question
whether the works to be used are indeed registered. Would it be the responsibility of users to
verify whether a work is registered and thus protected?
Finally it is noted that there is no need for changing the current way works become copyright
protected (while this would also be in violation with the Berne Convention and TRIPS).
Everything that is – summarized “originally created” is protected as a work. Registration
would not solve possible items related to the question if something is “original” or not (and it
would only in that case only be an unnecessary burden).
Where would such a registration process be managed? It could only work if registration is
done in a European/ Global database. What happens if there are conflicting registrations of
works? Will there be an international complaint procedure? How will that effect the
exploitation and distribution possibilities for collective Management Organizations?
The creation of a general registration system at EU level for all copyright works would
therefore only be justified if it had a clear benefit for those who use this registry and also
for all creators and rightholders. Having a static source of information that is costly and
impractical would certainly not serve this purpose


How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
„identifiers‟. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are

                                                                                                25

specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

     19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
         content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
         ownership and permissions databases?
[Open question]

As there are already several standard codes related to content, the EU could declare those
codes minimal standards possibly to be used. For music the existing standardised codes are
ISWC for musical works and ISRC for musical recording. The application of these codes in
the commercial world is yet to come. If no action is taken there will be several codes for the
same content. Those codes will come from YouTube or iTunes identifiers.

The standards for identifiers but also data-exchange require investments. This should be done
by and used in the whole value chain. The EC could present the identifiers used by CMO‟s
such as Buma/Stemra in the form of non-binding Standard and recommended practices
(SARPS) to be used to identify works.
In no way these recommended identifiers should frustrate the efforts taken to create the GRD
and other repertoire aggregation initiatives.
Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).




31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

      20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
          environment?
     YES – Please explain
Copyright provides the basis whereby rightholders receive fair remuneration.
The online legal offer of copyrighted works gives users access to legal online content. Now
that digital content is offered and is thus immortalized for future generations, the duration of
protection is relevant indeed, especially because now the content remains available in high
quality for a very long period of time. The duration of copyright is currently limited to 70
years after the death of the author. The duration of copyright might at first sight seem long,
but can certainly be justified. It gives authors the time (to determine how) to exploit their
work and to try to make a living with it. When an author dies, and his work is then still
commercially exploited, it is only fair that his heirs still receive compensation for the use of
those works . This is even more true in the situation that a work is successful only after the
author has died (which is not exceptional) . The current term of copyright should therefore
remain unchanged. Furthermore the functional use is still the same (people listening to music)
so the term is still valid. Finally this term is used more or less all over the world so the term
set in Europe is consistent.
        Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States‟ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

     21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
         provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

When it comes to creating a single market and a level playing field for users and rightsholders
then it would be considered useful to achieve a greater level of harmonization and legal
certainty. Apparently in some countries certain use requires a license while in other countries
no license is needed. In certain cases damages of rightsholders are compensated by a levy
system.




39
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

    22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
        a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
Please see answer under 21.
   23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
       catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
No, the existing ones are sufficient. In the Netherlands almost all exceptions have been
implemented.

Based on our experience in dealing with exceptions as a CMO, if feels that in most cases the
lack of information regarding the possibilities of use without a license - as provided for under
the exceptions - causes unnecessary issues and political debate.
The introduction of a possible general ' Fair use ' exception - as an open standard by which
this type of use is tested - does not seem desirable as it will bring even more legal uncertainty.
It will not be clear in that situation for both rights holders and users when or whether a license
is required. Furthermore it does not fit in the system of exceptions Europe has.

In the Netherlands, in cooperation with rightsholders and Google research has been done on
" Fair use" in the context of a seminar on April 23, 2013. As an outcome and
recommendation it is considered that the introduction of a "Fair use" exception is not really
necessary. See: http://www.ie-
forum.nl/index.php?//Aanbevelingen+voor+een+flexibele+uitoefening+van+auteursrecht////3
2162/ . We will attach a copy of the report with our reply.

The degree of harmonization depends on the degree to which individual Member States have
transposed the exceptions from the directive into national law. The level of implementation of
the Copyright Directive in the Member States could be looked into, although there doesn‟t
seem to be a problem. For example In the Netherlands, there is an educational exception . The
questions in Section B show that the educational exception does not apply in the same way in
all Member States . If nevertheless it is considered to be necessary that adjustment of the
exceptions is necessary, it is suggested to ensure first the clarification and harmonization of
certain exceptions without departing from the scope of the exclusive right and copyright
protection of the works of rightsholders. Ensuring an equitable remuneration is also a part of
this.
Finally, copyright exceptions and Fair use are often mentioned in the context of UGC. People
feel that a child who makes a movie with her cat dancing and using a hit of for example
Beyoncé should not be bothered by rightholders (which by the way they are not..). However,
this issue (fair compensation for right owners on one side and the (practical) impossibility to
license all UGC on a consumer level) could be solved by holding the platform (through which
we receive the UGC such as YouTube) directly liable on the basis of copyright. This is in our
opinion the way to license all content put on the internet by consumers (see also under F. User
Generated Content).
   24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
       degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

No, the exceptions already provide for sufficient flexibility. This is shown by the fact that in
practise there is almost no case law (independent from general case law on the exceptions
itself).

The possible uncertainty for users can be derived from the fact that there is an information
asymmetry between users and rightsholders. Effort should be put into communication. That is
why Buma Stemra believes communication and clarification of the exceptions is primarily the
best approach. Please also see the answer under Q 23.

       25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
           by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations
           by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing
           provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative
           advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on
           the functioning of the Internal Market.
       26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
           a problem?

No

       27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
           have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be
           addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom,
           where?)


A.         Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

We are as already mentioned of the opinion that current EU law and international
treaties provide the necessary flexibility for copyright and exceptions and limitations
thereto. There is currently no need to introduce any new exception. Moreover we
provide the necessary solutions through dedicated licensing for e.g. teaching,
educational institutions, research, archives etc. We not only do this in the Netherlands
for musical works but also in collaboration with other rights organisations.
This is our answer to all questions regarding the exceptions (Q 28-52).


1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
     28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
         problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or
         other subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?

Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
   32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
      problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
      provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?

consultation of musical works.

E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
   36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
      when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending),
      including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?

     39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
         libraries‟ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending
         and activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-
         lending? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
We refer to the following answer in the reply of Gesac:

CMOs are licensing e-lending of music files by libraries and other institutions since these
activities are an exploitation of copyright protected works. E lending in particular has all the
same characteristics as a commercial market in that it gives an infinite number of people
access to an infinite number of digital files in the library at the same time. E lending therefore
has the same economic impact and market characteristics as commercial services that invest
in streaming, downloading and other means to deliver services to consumers. It is therefore
very different in impact from on premises consultation and physical lending where a limited
number of people have access to individual copies of physical for specific and limited periods
of time. There is therefore no reason for an exception for e lending. The De Wolf study
provides support for this argument. It would also cut across licences by rightsholders for these
activities and would therefore also fail the so-called “three-step-test”.


Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with

launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not

to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

We refer to the following answer given bij Gesac:

In our view, text and data mining constitutes use in copyright terms. However this not an
InfoSoc Directive related issue. Such issue is to be considered under the Database Directive.
Depending on the technology chosen by the miner or his/her technical contributor, the
behaviour is either reproduction or falls within the scope of the general rule on the
exploitation of works that is subject to the authorization of the right holder. In the case of
databases, Article 7 (5) of the Database Directive is extremely relevant in this respect. (The
repeated and systematic extraction and/or re-utilization of insubstantial parts of the contents
of the database implying acts which conflict with a normal exploitation of that database or
which unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the maker of the database shall not be
permitted.)

There is not any exception (free use) in this regard. Presumably, such a broad exception that
would permit data and text mining in general would conflict with the Member States‟
international obligations.




   54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
We refer specifically to the following answer from Gesac:

It would be possible to introduce the rule of a properly defined free text/data mining for
educational or scientific purposes without permitting the making of a permanent copy. It
should be however clear that privileged data (personal data, trade secrets etc.) shall not be
subject to the exception, and the exclusive database right with regards to the insubstantial
parts of databases should not be eroded by the exception. In addition - with due regard to the
sensitive, privileged data - TPM should be privileged in relation to any possible new
exception. Commercial uses should not fall within the scope of the text/data mining. It is
worth considering also applying the exception of the citation to the data mining. It would
mean that the indication of the source (respect of moral rights) as well as the proportionality
of the citation could also be applied to the new eventual exception of data mining.
   55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
       elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?

     57. Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
         text or data mining methods?
It is necessary that the functional goal is clear if the subject is datamining. It can only be used
to analyse trends and may never lead to individual information which can possibly conflict
any privacy laws.

User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

Please find below the answers of Buma/Stemra to questions 58 to 63
The existing exceptions provide both rightholders and users a sufficiently adequate
framework in which the balance between uses and rights holders (using the three -step test) is
sufficiently reflected . See also our answer(s) regarding the exceptions.

User Generated Content ( UGC ), although it is still unclear what the exact definition of it is,
flourishes as never before . In that perspective it is not clear why the rights of rightsholders
should be more restricted by new limitations and/or exceptions. This much is clear that
rightsholders have not hindered the creation and distribution of UGC in any way. We refer
also to our answer in the section on Limitations and exceptions.
Copyright liability of “platforms”
We feel that on the basis of article 3 InfoSoc Directive it is (also) possible to hold (as we call
them) “platform”(suppliers) (for example YouTube, Vimeo and Soundcloud) directly liable on
the basis of copyright. In that respect it should not matter if the content on the websites as
mentioned is delivered by others (consumers or (other) third parties) or is installed on the
server of a third party. If you look at the website the intervention from the platform creates an
overall audiovisual product (see Airfield) and given that it is not logical that there should be
nothing to license. It would help the landscape if the European Legislator would confirm this
view.
Consumers that upload content they make do not have to fear in case of UGC if the
rightsholders are able to license the platforms on the basis of copyright, which even more
makes the implementation of the possible concept of a Fair use exception, taking into account
all what has been said in the section on Limitations and exceptions, not necessary. For rights
                                                                                                42

owners it is essential that they can act on the basis of copyright: this gives better enforcement
measures, possibility of an ex parte, sentence on actual costs and it is easier to prove
infringement than an unlawful act. Moreover it also creates a level playing field as UGC
platforms are directly in competition with sites such as I-tunes, Spotify and Netflix. Please find
at the end of this reply a scheme attached from which it follows that there are no reasons why,
from content perspective, there should be a difference in (copyright) treatment between
platforms and sites as Spotify, Rdio and Deezer. Nor there is a reason why a site such as
Nederland FM should be treated differently for that matter.




        Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers‟ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

      64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
          the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?

1)     The CJEU has given the necessary interpretation and guidelines to clarify the
application of private copying exception and since the interpretation of other
substantive issues are currently pending with the Court, there is no need to deal further
with the scope and application of the system at EU level.
2)     Rightholders have provided all the necessary practical and operational solutions
to implement those decisions for a smoother and more streamlined functioning of the
Internal Market.
Currently the only missing element is the willingness of the manufacturers and
distributors of recording devices (almost all of which are non-EU companies) to comply
with EU law.

We are of the opinion that private copying remuneration schemes are a key element of the
Digital Eco-System and of the European cultural and artistic scene. They constitute a win-win
model for all stakeholders including Member States as long as everybody plays the game.
They are fully compatible with new business models, the development of new products and
services and contribute to the dynamism of the market.

We regret that the introduction given by the Commission to this part of the questionnaire does
not give any reference to the rulings of the CJEU, which has consistently clarified and
emphasised important principles on the private copying exception and its accompanying
compensation. The Court also justified, to a great extent, the existing implementation of the
private copy remuneration schemes in those rulings. We therefore believe that since those
recent decisions of the CJEU gave the necessary interpretation and guidelines to clarify the
application of the private copying exception and since the other outstanding substantial issues
are currently dealt with by the pending cases of the Court, there is no need to further deal with
the scope and application of the system at EU level.

As regards the scope and application of private copying exception and accompanying fair
compensation the Court ruled that:

1- concerning copies made for professional uses:
In its Padawan ruling (C-467/08), the CJEU held that Article 5.2.b) of the InfoSoc Directive
must be interpreted as excluding from the private copying remuneration media or devices
which are not used for private purposes.

Insofar as a company can purchase media or devices which will be used for private copying
(such is in particular the case of mobile phones which are purchased by a company and given
to its employees who will use it for both professional and private purposes), the CJEU
subjected the non-applicability of the private copying remuneration both to the purchase of
the medium or device by a person not acting for a private purpose and to the fact that these
media and devices are clearly reserved for purposes other than private.

Therefore it is the nature of the usage which is key in determining the applicability of the
private copying remuneration and not the person buying the media or devices, as was
confirmed by the Court in its Amazon ruling (C-521/11).

As for the implementation of such principle, it was decided in the Amazon ruling that it is
perfectly possible to subject legal persons to the private copying remuneration while
                                                                                               44
04-03-2014 Reply Buma/Stemra NL



excluding purely professional usages by organizing (i) an exoneration scheme when it is
certain that the media or devices purchased by such legal persons are so for professional
purposes only (e.g. DVDs purchased by a medical imagery office) or (ii) in other cases, to an
effective reimbursement scheme upon justification of the usage of such media or devices
where there are sufficient practical difficulties to determine the purpose of the use of the
purchased medium or device.

It is also possible to provide for a presumption of private copying use enabling the application
of the remuneration for private copying when the media and carriers are purchased by private
persons provided:
a) there are sufficient practical difficulties to determine the purpose of the use of the media
and carrier purchased;
b) the presumption is rebuttable - this to avoid imposing a remuneration outside of a situation
of private copying.

2- concerning the payee of the private copying remuneration
Given the practical difficulties in identifying private users and in obliging them to compensate
rightholders, the Court ruled in its Padawan decision that it is open to the Member States to
establish a „private copying levy‟ for the purposes of financing fair compensation, chargeable
not to the private persons concerned but to those who have the digital reproduction
equipment, devices and media and who make that equipment available to private users or who
provide copying services for them.

3- concerning the coexistence of a contractual authorization and the private copying
exception

In its VG Wort decision (C-457/11 to 460/11), the CJEU held that where a Member State has
decided to introduce in its national law the private copying exception, the authorization
granted by the rightholders to allow the making of private copies is devoid of any legal effect.

It also clearly stated that insofar as a contractual authorization to allow the making of private
copies has no legal object, it cannot have any bearing on the fair compensation which
constitutes its recompense.

4- concerning social and cultural actions

After stressing that the InfoSoc Directive does not impose on Member States the obligation to
ensure to rightholders the payment of all of the private copying remuneration, the CJEU ruled,
in its Amazon decision, that Member States enjoy a wide discretion and therefore could
provide that part of that remuneration can be provided in the form of indirect compensation as
long as the scheme implemented actually benefitted the rights holders and was not
discriminatory.

5- concerning the cross border trade of recording media and devices

After recalling that Member States which introduced the private copying exception have an
obligation to achieve a certain result in the sense that they must guarantee to the right holders
the actual payment of a fair compensation to compensate the harm arisen on their territory (as
                                                                                                45
04-03-2014 Reply Buma/Stemra NL



held by the Court in its Opus ruling (C-462/09)) and that the harm to be compensated
materializes not at the level of the transfer of the recording media or devices but with the
reproduction carried out on such media or devices by a person for a private use, the CJEU
held, in its Amazon judgment, that when the place of transfer of the media and the place
where the reproduction on such media or devices occurs are not the same, it is the latter point
of contact which must prevail.

The fact that there has been a first payment of the private copying remuneration in the country
of transfer cannot be an obstacle to the payment of an analogous remuneration in the country
of destination of the medium or device as it is the place where the harm is characterized.

6- concerning the DRMs

In the VG Wort case (C-457/11 to 460/11), the CJEU specified that the existence of a
technological measure is not intended to eliminate the exception for private copying when the
national law of the concerned Member State recognizes such exception. Only the level of fair
compensation can vary depending on the application of a DRM.

CMOs offer and promote solutions that implement the above-mentioned rulings and that
would ease cross-border trade in the Single Market, however the manufacturers and
distributors of devices, almost all of which are non-EU companies, reject and avoid any
solutions in this respect and resist to comply with the EU law, since their primary objective is
maximising their profits by not paying any levies at all at the expense of creators and
European creative sector.

Pending cases ACI Adam (C‑435/12), CopyDan (Case C-463/12) and Hewlett Packard
Belgium (Case C-572/13) will clarify the outstanding issues, such as consideration of copies
made from illegal sources and calculation of the amount of levies paid by the manufacturers
and distributors of recording devices that are subject to private copy levies.

Please note that the advocate general in the ACI Adam case already mentions that illegal
sources cannot be legalized through private copying but that nevertheless the current
compensation in the Netherlands is too low.

     65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
         a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the
         rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59
X YES
Licensing and application of the private copying levies co-exist and they are not mutually
exclusive. This point of law has also been clarified by the CJEU in its VG Wort v. Kyocera
ruling

     66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
         services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on
         different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models
         on the one hand and rightholders‟ revenue on the other?

We consider that private copying remuneration schemes are fully compatible with the
development of new business models, products and services related to digital content. The
emergence of new business models, as well as of the consumer devices, has exponentially
grown over the past years, without being affected by private copying remuneration schemes.

[Open question]
     67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
         subject to levies?60
We totally agree with the objective but do not believe that this technical point requires a
legislative change at EU level within the InfoSoc Directive. This is certainly not a big
problem in terms of cross-border application of levies; in fact, it is already applied in the
Netherlands and its application can easily be extended to all Member States with the
agreement of all stakeholders involved.


Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

     68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
         undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to
         the free movement of goods or services?
     69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
         persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those
         transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you
         provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
     70. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
         extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in
         some Member States help to remedy the situation?

       71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
           system, how would these problems best be solved?


Please find below the Buma Stemra answers to questions 64 to 71:
The Private copying levies represent a major source of income for our rightsholders.
1)      As pointed out in answer to question 64 above the CJEU has already clarified all these
issues in its recent judgments.
2)      The Commission, however, should focus its efforts more on stopping the worrying
situations in Spain and the UK that are in contradiction with EU law.
3)     The situation in the Netherlands is also worrying because the manufacturers do
nothing else than rejecting EU law and proceed wherever they can in order to quit paying the
fair compensation.


         Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

       72. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
           combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration
           for the exploitation of your works and performances?

For the right balance of power between author and user (rate level / enforcement / processing
data) collective management is the best solution.

       73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
           contracts)?

     74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
         address the shortcomings you identify?
Regarding question 72-74 we refer explicitly to the answer given by Gesac:
For many reasons, the individual author is rarely able to enforce his/her rights effectively
without his/her authors‟ society:
•       the increasingly diverse ways of using works makes it difficult and illusory for an
author to exert personal control over the use made of his works


•       even with today‟s technologies, authors cannot learn how to manage the efficient
exploitation of their rights across all different media around the world overnight, not all can
afford the relevant investment;
•       it is also manifestly clear that the individual author stands in a weak bargaining
position compared to increasingly economically powerful users. If they are not to be deprived
of their rightful remuneration, authors must rely on institutions which they can trust to
manage their rights for them
•      collective management offers high standards in terms of transparency and
accountability and the individual author is ensured to have his/her rights managed on a non-
discriminatory basis. In this respect, the recent CRM Directive provides high standards for
governance and rights management, for the benefit of authors and composers.
Authors‟ societies play a vital role in ensuring that authors are paid the royalties they are
entitled to, by defending their interests, engaging in negotiations with users, monitoring
exploitations, and collecting and adequately distributing royalties to their members and,
through their sister societies, to foreign rights holders.
It is essential, for authors‟ societies to effectively protect the rights and interest of their
members in dealings with important and powerful third parties, that they received an
exclusive assignment of rights from their members. It is the only way to prevent individual
rightholders being pressured into disadvantageous agreements.



       Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by

be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

     75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
         infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

     76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
         involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising
         brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
         online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures
         would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

     77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
         achieved between the right to have one‟s copyright respected and other rights such
         as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?

We believe that respect for rights and the enforcement of rights are as important as the scope
and definition of the rights themselves. Some of the propositions made by the Commission in
the introduction to this section and within the questions are worrying.

Stating first that “one means to deal with the issue could be to clarify the role of
intermediaries in the IP infrastructure” while excluding any debate on the liability regime
provided by the E-Commerce Directive is incomprehensible. In order to clarify the role of any
intermediary to ensure higher level of respect for rights, the safe harbour regime provided by
the E-Commerce Directive needs to be re-considered for copyright related activities. We refer
to our remarks in several Sections regarding platforms such as YouTube, Soundcloud and
Vimeo. We also refer to the proceedings initiated by Sabam.

Furthermore we would like to underline that using the word “commercial” and trying to give a
certain definition as a criterion for enforcement is in our opinion not a productive approach. In
a rapidly changing internet environment it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to
determine which acts have commercial relevance and for whom. Moreover, leaving all “non-
commercial” acts, whatever it would mean, outside of protection would not comply with the
respect for the exclusive rights provided by EU law and international treaties

Finally we note that organizations that protect the interests of rightsholders ( such as the anti-
piracy organization BREIN (who operates on behalf of rightsholders in all areas in the
Netherlands), should be provided with the legal enforcement resources to act efficiently and
effectively against pirates. This may for example include regulations that allow blocking of

   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by

sites by access providers. In this respect it is useful to inform you of the following – in our
opinion very wrongful - judgment.

The anti-piracy organization BREIN initiated judicial proceedings against several access
providers in 2011 demanding that they stop the facilitating of infringements of (users of) the
Pirate Bay through their networks (mainly on the basis of article 26d of the Dutch Copyright
ACT, the equivalent of article 11 of the Enforcement Directive). The district Court of
Amsterdam ruled that the providers should indeed block access to the Pirate Bay for their
users. However, last month this verdict was overruled in appeal. The Court of Appeal (case
number: 374634 / HA ZA 10-3184) argued that the blocking of the Pirate Bay was not
‘effective’, even though (as it assumed) the number of visitors to the Pirate Bay had dropped
considerably as a result of the blockade. The Court’s reasoning regarding ‘effectiveness’ is
very strict, and it is doubtful whether it is accordance with European case law. What the
Court said was that the fact that the number of visitors to the Pirate Bay dropped wasn’t
relevant, since (in short) the total number of infringements by end users on the networks of the
service providers did not go down. If consumers perform infringing acts via other routes- for
instance through proxy’s or other torrent sites- the requested measure cannot be effective. In
other words, BREIN’s request would have to apply not only to the Pirate Bay, but to a
significant (?) amount of other infringing websites (and proxy providers?), for the requested
order to be considered to be able to be effective.
Brein gave notice of appeal.


         A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States‟ legal systems.

   78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
       of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across
       the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
   79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
       current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a
       longer term project?
We are of the opinion that there is no need for the complete harmonisation of copyright in the
EU by means of a comprehensive copyright code because, basically, the existing EU
legislative acts already ensure a high standard of copyright protection.
There are a few things the European Commission could clarify. We refer to our remarks in
that respect.

(Re)transmission (via cable networks) and the unreasonable interpretation of the CJEU
with regard to the „new public‟ criterion.

In recent years there have been a number of judgments by the Dutch and European Courts
with regard to the „(new) public‟ criterion which, in some aspects, have been detrimental to
the interests of right holders. Please find an outline of our concerns below.

Too narrow interpretation of „public‟

The Court has repeatedly stated that the term „public‟ refers to an „indeterminate number of
potential viewers/listeners‟ and also to a „fairly large number of persons‟. Furthermore the
Court has implied that the public reached has to consist of „end users‟, i.e. the general public
(see for instance the Court‟s ruling in SGAE/Rafael hotels).

These rulings of the Court, and the implementation thereof in Dutch case law, have led to
undesirable misunderstandings and/or consequences for right holders, especially in the field
of (re)broadcasting of television channels. It is also doubtful whether they are in accordance
with international standards, notably the Berne convention. The importance of the Berne
Convention can hardly be underestimated. It is still the most important international treaty
regarding the protection of copyright and, as the Court has noted, community legislation has
to be interpreted in accordance with international law standards (see for instance SGAE/Rafael
hotels par. 35). Therefore the Berne Convention (more specifically article 11, 11bis and
11ter) is still very relevant for the determination of the exact meaning of „public‟.

The Berne Convention does not contain a specific definition of the term „public‟ itself.
However, Ricketson and Ginsberg have provided a further clarification on this point. (S.
Ricketson and J. Ginsburg, International Copyright and Neighbouring Rights, The Berne
Convention and Beyond (second edition), Oxford University Press 2006, nr. 12.02 (p. 704)).
From the structure of the Berne Convention they deduct that excluded from the term „public‟
is only the immediate family circle. They admit that in the absence of clear conventional
guidelines, it is for the national courts and authorities to determine the specific demarcation
between what is public and private, but they also note that “this line must not be set in such a
way as to prejudice the author‟s right to exploit his work by means of a public performance or
a communication to the public.”

Unfortunately, the CJEU and Dutch Courts have done exactly the latter. An important
example of this is the Dutch case law regarding retransmission of broadcasting signals.
Broadcasters often no longer transmit their broadcasts in a „traditional‟ manner (via
electromagnetic waves, which can be received by anyone), but instead only transmit them to
certain commercial entities (i.e. cable operators) who then (re)transmit the signals to the
consumer. This has led the courts to believe that with regard to the first step by broadcasters
they no longer reach a „public‟ in the sense of the InfoSoc Directive and the case law of the
CJEU. (see for instance Court of Appeals the Hague, 10-04-2012 (Norma/NLKabel), IER
2012/38, judgement of the Supreme Court expected on March 28). The reasoning in these
cases is based almost purely on the judgments of the CJEU, such as Rafael Hoteles and
Airfield. As noted above, we do not believe that this case law is in conformance with the
demands of the Berne Convention. The fact that a signal is only received by professional
entities does not mean that no public is reached, since the only thing that should not be
regarded as „public‟ is the private (family) circle. That the recipients of the signal do not
constitute a significant number of persons, should also not be considered as relevant. As
Ricketson and Ginsburg point out with regard to the interpretation of article 8 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty (WCT): “The WCT does not define the public to whom the works are made
available, but it may give greater indication than does the Berne Convention that the relevant
public is comprised of members, and, accordingly, need not be populous, although the greater
the numbers to whom a work is made available, the more apparent the conclusion that the
making available was to the public.” (S. Ricketson and J. Ginsburg, International Copyright
and Neighbouring Rights, The Berne Convention and Beyond (second edition), Oxford
University Press 2006, nr. 12.58 (p. 746)).

The aforementioned case law has led to very unreasonable consequences. On the basis of
these judgments, it is unclear who can be held liable to pay a fair remuneration to right
holders, even though the business models and income levels of the broadcasters and
distributors have (essentially) not altered. The only thing that has undergone a minor
(technical) change, is the way they get their signal to the public.

As noted, we do not believe that these judgments are in conformance with the International
Treaties relating to copyright. If the European legislator is not willing to clarify that the
notion of „public‟ refers to any audience (persons)that cannot be regarded as the private
(family) circle, there is perhaps another way by which the unreasonable consequences of this
case law may be alleviated. Dutch (case) law does not contain any clear rules regarding joint
liability for infringements of copyright, and as far as we know, neither does European law.
We feel that, even if there is, strictly speaking, only one party that (technically) communicates
works to the public (as in the examples described above), it should be possible to hold several
parties accountable for that (single) act. After all, if several parties are actively involved in the
transmission of a signal to the public, it seems no more than reasonable to hold them
collectively accountable for such a transmission as was the case before. Such an approach
will prevent that the several parties involved- also those who profit the most from such
transmissions, i.e. the broadcasters and/or distributors- can circumvent their obligation to pay
the remuneration by simply delivering their signals to a third party that redirects the signal to
the consumer.

Public has to be „new‟

                                                                                                  53

Another important aspect of the Court‟s case law is that the public reached has to be „new‟,
i.e. a public that has not been taken into account when the right holders gave permission for
the initial transmission. The fact that the public reached has to be „new‟, is a criterion that has
no basis in international law, is hard to (logically) apply in practice and also has highly
unreasonable effects for right holders. The CJEU has been using this criterion since the Rafael
Hoteles case, but seems to have underestimated the difficulties inherent in determining
whether a public is new in specific circumstances. The fact that it is (very) hard to determine
whether the right holders have actually taken a specific audience into consideration when
granting a licence for a communication, is also the reason why the implementation of this
criterion was rejected by the delegates at the 1948 Brussels Revision Conference with regard
to article 11bis of the Berne Convention. Thus the current formulation of article 11bis of the
convention was adopted, which confers on authors the right to authorize “any communication
to the public by wire or by rebroadcasting of the work, where this communication is made by
an organization other than the original one” (S. Ricketson and J. Ginsburg, International
Copyright and Neighbouring Rights, The Berne Convention and Beyond (second edition),
Oxford University Press 2006, nr. 12.27 (p. 726)).

The difficulties in determining whether a public is in fact „new‟ also becomes apparent from
the (inconsistent) case law of the CJEU. On the one hand the Court says that a public can be
considered as new when it was taken into account by the right holder when granting a licence
for the original transmission, but on the other hand the Court, in some cases, has basically
determined itself what the right holders supposedly have or have not taken into account when
granting a licence for a particular communication, thus turning it into an objective rather than
a subjective criterion. For instance in the Airfield judgment the Court stated that a provider of
„satellite packages‟, that creates a „new audiovisual product‟ by bundling programmes of
broadcasting organisations, reaches a new public, because, in the view of the Court, the
consumers who make use of such a package have not been taken into account when the right
holders granted a licence to the broadcasters. This because the broadcasters purportedly serve
a different audience than the audience targeted by the package providers (see par. 76 and
further of the judgment). So in this case the existence of a new public was assumed even
though one might well argue that the target audience of the broadcasters at issue clearly
overlaps with the audience reached by the satellite package providers. Conversely, in the
recent Svensson case, the Court stated that in the situation in which access to a website is not
subject to any restrictive measures, the public targeted by that communication consists of all
potential visitors to the site (i.e. every internet user in the world). From this proposition it
follows that the right holders have taken all these potential visitors into account if they have
granted a licence to such a site. So, to summarize the view of the Court in this case, when a
licence is obtained for the placement of copyrighted material on a website that is freely
accessible, the (re)placement of the relevant content on another website can never reach a
public that is new, since, apparently, the right holders also took the visitors of that other
website into account when they granted a licence to the website on which the content was
originally placed (apparently such other websites can also not be regarded as „new audiovisual
products‟).

The examples described above make it clear that the question whether a right holder has or
has not taken a particular audience „into account‟, leads to illogical and circular reasoning.
The right holders, when granting a licence, will (have to) take into account all the public
which (according to the CJEU) cannot be considered as new, and conversely, will not take
                                                                                                 54

into account the public that (according to the CJEU) can be considered as new (see also: D. J.
G. Visser, „openbaar maken met ketchup‟, AMI, 2013-2, p. 46). So, to give a practical
example, if a right holder now issues a licence to a website that is freely accessible, they will
have to take into account that such a website reaches every possible audience in the world and
that every (re)placement and exploitation of the relevant material on another website (with a
totally different businessmodel than the site of which they took the content (!)) can never be
separately licensed by him. Consequently, the right holders will have to obtain the
remuneration they desire for all these different audiences and exploitations from the owner of
the website on which the content is initially placed. This is however impossible. The owner of
the website on which the content is initially placed does not make the profit all the other
websites do.

Given the complexities related to this „new public‟ criterion, and the fact that it is
questionable whether its implementation is in accordance with international law standards, the
European legislature might want to consider whether a (simple) „public‟ criterion is not
sufficient as opposed to the „new public‟ criterion. Not only would that prevent all the
complex issues that will arise (and have arisen) regarding the question whether a public can in
fact be considered as „taken into account‟ by the right holders, but it will also lead to more
reasonable results. After all, if a party („another organization‟) makes content accessible to a
public (whether that is new or not), and derives a profit from that, why should that not suffice
to regard such an act as a „communication to the public‟ in the sense of the InfoSoc directive?
Why should it matter that there is a (possible) overlap between the audience reached by one
party and that reached by another? With regard to the internet it seems simple: if I click on a
website and I can hear music the website owner should be responsible for that according to
Copyright law no matter how he or she technically got the music on the site.

Please be also advised that we fully support the remarks that Gesac has given under Q80
The real problem to which a possible review or modernisation of copyright should find a
solution is adequate remuneration of creators in the digital environment. The digital
exploitation involves its own players - host providers, access providers, search engines, etc.
which generate high revenues thanks to the use of copyright protected works and demand of
consumers for „broader‟-bands to use creative works.
