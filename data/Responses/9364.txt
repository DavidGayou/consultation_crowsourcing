TYPE OF RESPONDENT (Please underline the appropriate):
  Intermediary/Distributor/Other service provider (e.g. online music or
  audiovisual service, games platform, social media, search engine, ICT industry)
  OR Representative of intermediaries/distributors/other service providers
        for the purposes of this questionnaire normally referred to in questions as
       "service providers"




                                                                                       1
8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e.
when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
  YES
  NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would
be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach 1 )

No, the making-available right is not sufficiently clear. Problems do emerge due to
the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation (see response to
question 10).

10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of
two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment
(e.g. a download) create problems for you?
  YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address
such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands,
legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Yes, the application of two rights for one act of exploitation creates problems with
regard to the distribution of content by providers. To offer content to users via online
and mobile platforms the reproduction on the server of the service provider is a
necessary condition for the making available of such content.
In the past both rights (right of reproduction and right of making available) necessary
for the online and mobile exploitation of music were granted by the respective
collecting societies in Europe. As a result of the European Commission’s
Recommendation in 2005, Anglo-American music publishers withdrew their right of
reproduction from the collective management by collecting societies. The right of
making available for the respective musical works remained within collective
management. Therefore the current situation renders applicable two complementary
licensing systems - collective rights management and single licensing - to one
musical work used in one and the same economic process. The aim of facilitating the
licensing process for the content provider through collective rights management is
jeopardised. Although rights managers, such as CELAS for the EMI publishing
repertoire, are licensing the corresponding making available right for the Anglo-
American EMI publishing repertoire the situation for the content provider remains
difficult. For the right of making available CELAS is acting not in its own name but in
the name of PRS and GEMA as a representative. If there is a dispute regarding the
ownership of the rights the content provider would have difficulties to ask for
indemnification as it is unclear, who should be addressed.
The issue is reinforced as most of the musical works have so called split copyrights,
which means that part of the work are owned by various rightholders.
To solve this problem it should be clarified that a fixation/reproduction which is from a
technological point of view merely an economically irrelevant component of the
subsequent (on demand) communication to the public should not be treated as a
relevant act at all. Therefore, the reproduction right should always be an integral part
of the “making available” right.



                                                                                           2
11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
  YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why
……………………………………………………………………………………………
  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of
communication to the public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by
a copyright exception)

No. Linking should not be subject to the authorisation of a rightholder.

The hyperlink provision is facilitating access to a work that has already been
published on a specific website. This should not be understood as a new publishing
or as a duplication/reproduction of this work (see also German jurisdiction by BGH I
ZR 259/00 from 17.07.2003 “Paperboy”; BGH I ZR 39/08 from 29.04.2010 “Session-
ID”, except if a protection measure has been by-passed in order to provide the link).
 The ECJ has just recently confirmed this reading(Case C-466/12) by stating that “
Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the provision on
a website of clickable links to works freely available on another website does not
constitute an act of communication to the public, as referred to in that provision.”
Furthermore, the ECJ clarified that Article 3 (l) of Directive 2001/29 does preclude
Member States from offering wider protection to copyrights holders as otherwise the
concept of communication to the public would inevitably be undermined.


If a work has been published on a specific website without consent of the rightholder,
he has (at least in Germany) the right to claim the take down of the link. This right
exists irrespective of whether or not the link provision is by itself copyright-relevant
and does also apply to other kind of infringements as e.g. infringements of personal
rights.

Links in the form of embedding content do not require any different analysis.
Embedding content via an (inline) link does not constitute a transmission or
retransmission and the work is not communicated to a “new public”. Moreover, the
link provider has no control over the (future) availability of the linked content. Thus,
from a copyright perspective, embedding does not interfere with any exclusive right. It
has to be pointed out that an exclusive right in regard to embedding would lead to
severe negative consequences for internet and its social benefits. Finally, it has to be
noted that it would be diametrical in opposition to the interest of the rightholders to
make embedding subject to an exclusive copyright. Due to prohibitive transaction
cost (inline) linking would simply vanish. Rightholders would not be able to increase
their revenues. From an economic perspective two technical aspects have to be
taken into account: (i) the link provider has no control over the availability of the
linked content (what price would he be willing to pay?), and (ii) the person who
initially makes content publicly available on the internet has technical control in

                                                                                       3
regard to whether or not the content may be embedded on third party sites. She/He
should remain the sole licensor of the rightholder.

12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on
the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general
or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?
  YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why
  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a
copyright exception)
  NO OPINION
No, the viewing of a web-page should neither in general nor under specific
circumstances be subject to the authorization of the rightholder. Web-browsing
creates temporary copies that are covered by the exception established in Article 5
para. 1 of Directive 2001/29/EC and do not constitute an infringement of copyright.
For example in case of watching a film, the implemented streaming technology
requires a temporary, ephemeral duplication through buffering in the cache, however
this process is taking place automatically without being perceived by the user and the
copy is also automatically deleted, without any human intervention, after a certain
time.

Otherwise, those who merely browse the internet, without downloading anything, are
likely unintentionally to incur civil liability. As the UK Supreme Court referring the
question to the ECJ (Case C-360/13) has already rightly noted it would be an
unacceptable result to consider millions of ordinary Internet users to be copyright
infringers by dint of merely accessing a web-page containing copyright material. This
should also not be the intention of the European legislator.

15.    Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?
  YES
  NO
  NO OPINION


Yes. An EU wide registration system would facilitate licensing, if the result would be
an increased efficiency of the licensing process. Online services devote a great deal
of resources and manpower to licensing. In addition, likeliness that existing works
are not being used in a digital context due to the hurdles in identifying the respective
rightholders, might be reduced.




                                                                                           4
16.   What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
Open question]


A content registration system would lead to legal certainty for digital content
distributors. Much more simplicity and less administrative costs for distributors would
be possible advantages of such a system.


17.   What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]

The costs of such a sophisticated system could be a possible disadvantage. The
question who has to bare them needs to be clarified. Procedural issues, such as
jurisdiction and/or dispute resolution systems as well as the interplay with collecting
societies and the legal status of, and supervision on, their activities also need to be
addressed.

21.   Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member
States?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION

Yes, the optional character of most of the exceptions provided for by the EU
Directives is the source of problems and inhibits cross-border provision of services.

Cross-border services (e.g. cloud storage) demand a harmonized pan-European
legal framework. This applies from a content licensing perspective as well as from a
consumer perspective. It is important, that the same legal framework exists in order
to ensure, that a service, which is legal in one member state can also be offered in
another member state. For all providers of cross-border services the same legal and
competitive environment has to be established.

To illustrate the problem we would like give the following example:

According to Article 5, para. 2 b of Directive 2001/29/EC natural persons have the
right to make reproductions of works on any media for private use and for ends that
are neither directly nor indirectly commercial on condition that the rightholder
receives fair compensation and under the precondition that no copy protection
measures have been removed or altered. This limitation and exception is not
mandatory for the member states. The German legislator implemented this limitation
into German law (Section 53 of the German Copyright Act, Urhebergesetz - UrhG).
Therefore, in Germany the reproduction of works, e.g. by transferring a music file
                                                                                          5
from a CD on a personal computer or on cloud storage by an end user for private use
is possible without the consent of the rightholder. In the United Kingdom, Article 5,
para. 2 b of the Directive has not been implemented into national law. A comparable
copyright exception does not exist with the consequence that end users are not
allowed to make copies even for their own and immediate family’s use on different
media without the consent of the rightholder (See report “Digital Opportunity: A
review of intellectual property and growth” by Ian Hargreaves) . This may lead to the
situation that a provider of an online storage service could be held liable for copyright
infringement in the UK whereas the same service and the same provider would not
infringe any copyright in a member state in which Article 5, para. 2 b Directive
2001/29/EC has been implemented into national law, e.g. in Germany. This makes it
difficult to offer a cross-border online storage service.

22.   Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there
a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
   YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION

Yes. In order to achieve a higher level of harmonization, all limitations and exceptions
should be made mandatory. This is the only way to avoid a fragmentation of the legal
framework from member state to member state with the consequences as described
in the example in our answer to question 21.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a
greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and
exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
  NO – Please explain why

See response to question 21. There should be no flexibility with regard to the
member states in order to avoid a fragmentation of the legal framework among EU
member states.

27.   In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level
were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair
compensation” be addressed, when such compensation is part of the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]

Deutsche Telekom recognizes the importance for rightsholders to be compensated
for using their works and believes that the concept of ‘fair compensation’ should be
addressed at EU level. A uniform approach is necessary to allow for the efficient
implementation of the Copyright Directive in the age of cloud computing. A possible
solution is rights clearance and payment in the Member State where the service is
operated under the precondition that a) based on the country-of-origin principle b)

                                                                                        6
there is the possibility to clear the rights for all territories. Such a tariff must not be
construed in a way as to merely add-up all tariffs applicable in the individual Member
States but must be able to take into account diverging levels of usage across the
countries covered, i.e. no presumption of homogeneity as for a single territory or
areas which are characterized by common cultural/linguistic characteristics. In
addition, double payment should be avoided.



62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?


 Digital technologies have opened wonderful opportunities for everybody to create
 and share content online. As a result, there is a constant shift from consumers of
 copyright protected works to so called “prosumers”, users who do not only
 passively consume copyright protected works, but instead create new content on
 the basis of pre-existing works and thereby actively participate in the creative
 process. To give an idea of the relevance: today 130 hours of video are uploaded
 to YouTube every minute and there are 41,000 posts a second on facebook.
 New digital technologies have stimulated creativity and participation online in an
 unprecedented manner. This process should not be hindered by an overly broad
 copyright. A future copyright should allow the creation and sharing of creative user
 generated content (that include copyright protected material).
 Many commentators have already claimed that the introduction of a new exception
 clause is needed. We agree. However, we would like to point out that this issue is
 broader than just an exception and will require a change in paradigm. Copyright
 rules that were designed with content created ‘professionally’ are at odds with
 today’s creativity.
   Already 2008 the Commission pointed out (Green Paper “Copyright in the
 Knowledge Economy”, COM (2008) 466 final, page 19):
 “Consumers are not only users but are increasingly becoming creators of content.
 Convergence is leading to the development of new applications building on the
 capacity of ICT to involve users in content creation and distribution. Web 2.0
 applications such as blogs, podcasts, wiki, or video sharing, enable users easily to
 create and share text, videos or pictures, and to play a more active and
 collaborative role in content creation and knowledge dissemination.
 However, there is a significant difference between user-created content and
 existing content that is simply uploaded by users and is typically protected by
 copyright. In an OECD study, user-created content was defined as "content made
 publicly available over the Internet, which reflects a certain amount of creative
 effort, and which is created outside of professional routines and practices"
 (Participative Web and User-Created Content, OECD 2007, p. 9.).
 The Directive does not currently contain an exception which would allow the use of
 existing copyright protected content for creating new or derivative works. The
 obligation to clear rights before any transformative content can be made available
 can be perceived as a barrier to innovation in that it blocks new, potentially
 valuable works from being disseminated. “However, before any exception for
 transformative works can be introduced, one would need to carefully determine the


                                                                                          7
    conditions under which a transformative use in order to balance the economic
    interests of the rights holders of the original work with those creating new works.

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
application of the private copying and reprography exceptions 2 in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
     NO – Please explain
     NO OPINION




Yes, there is a need to clarify the application of the private copy exemption in the
sense that this exemption should not be optional, but mandatory for each member
state – see answer to question 21 and the example given therein.
However, there is no need to clarify the exception in Article 5, para. 2 b of Directive
2001/29/EC as implemented e.g. in Germany by Section 53 of the German Copyright
Act.

This exemption gives the end user the possibility to use the purchased content (e.g.
music) in an appropriate extent (e.g. transfer to portable music devices, private online
and offline storage).
Furthermore, it must be ensured that future technologies can be implemented (e.g.
efficient data storage mechanism) without the consequence that the limitation and
exception is not applicable any more.



65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the
context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the
harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies? 3
     YES – Please explain
     NO – Please explain


    Licensed copies cannot be subject to private copying compensation. Deutsche
    Telekom agrees with the conclusion reached by the European Mediator, Mr.
    Antonio Vitorino, in his recommendations to the European Commission, according
    to which online content services should not be subject to levies. As the Mediator
    effectively summarized: “The opposite view would pave the way for double
    payments. Consumers cannot be expected to show understanding for such double
    payments.”

 Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.
3
 This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private
copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                                       8
66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online
services (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users
to have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of
new business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]

The application of levies to online services as e.g. cloud computing would hinder the
development of new business models. The extension of the current levy system –
which was conceived within the analogue world - to the online environment needs to
be properly assessed, in order not to hamper the development of innovative
technologies and services.

The Vitorino report clearly indicates that attempts to broaden the interpretation of the
private copying exception are not only to the detriment of rightholders and legal offers
based on license agreements, but are also legally questionable and should not be
supported.

Cloud computing allows easier access to digital content for consumers and provides
artists with new distribution models. In the digital era, consumers need to be able to
access digital content from several connected devices at all times and from
anywhere. European consumers and Internet users would be the first victims of the
imposition of levies on cloud services since prices would most certainly rise because
of levies. Also, companies of all sizes, which are increasingly using cloud services,
could also face this consequence.

One of the main advantages of cloud services is their global nature; therefore
imposing territorial/national levy systems on global services is unfeasible, especially
considering the principles of the Single Market. Imposing levies on cloud services
would also have negative impact on European cloud service providers, as the
obligation to pay levies added to new administrative burden would significantly limit
their competitiveness in the global market. The negative impact on new business
models would be immediate, as levies would raise prices and thus limit the
attractiveness, competitiveness and future development of business models based
on new technologies.

Moreover in the digital world, often rightholders receive compensation for licensed
content including subsequent copies in the framework of licensing contracts between
rights-holders and users. In these cases, applying the copyright levy system to cloud
services would result in an unjustified triple payment by consumers (for the licensed
content, for the connected device, and for the cloud service).

It should also be noted that private copying levies are currently applied to devices
which contain a storage capacity, as it was assumed that since devices with a
storage capacity can be used to copy protected content they should all be subject to
levies. In the case of access-based cloud services, storage capacity in the device is
not needed and applying levies on them is thus incorrect.




                                                                                          9
67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for
products subject to levies? 4
    YES – Please explain
    NO – Please explain
    no opinion


Yes. Ensuring transparency for all market participants would avoid competitive
disruptions between market participants and would increase end-user education
about copyright protection. However, the practical implementation of increasing
transparency should not be too burdensome.

68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction
resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or
other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the
undue payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post
reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.
    NO – Please explain
    NO OPINION


No. At least in Germany, trans-border transactions are not taking place today.

69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any
of those transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the
example you provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]


In the German implementation there is no problem with transactions resulting in
undue payments. However, in other countries the implementation varies. The
exceptions as ensured by the Padawan judgement may be enforced in Hungary only
in narrow circumstances and only in case of non-writable devices, for instance. There
are certain kinds of devices where it is clear that the private person buyer will not
make any private copying use of it (e.g. camera memory cards), however, even in
these cases the levy is significant.



71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the
levy system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]

4
 This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private
copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                                       10
Deutsche Telekom recommends keeping the liability to pay the levy with
manufacturers and/or importers because manufacturers’ market shares are more
concentrated and consistent across member states than relevant retail market
shares. Manufacturers therefore can be seen to be in a position where they are better
equipped to come up with an efficient common pan-European technical solution to
collect levies. In addition, keeping liability with manufacturers/importers is also
supported by collecting societies 5 and at the same time not advocated for by any
leading European ICT companies.

A specific problem under German law is the system how the respective tariffs are
determined. Under the current system it occasionally takes years until a certain tariff
is finally fixed. Meanwhile all relevant parties need to deal with the uncertainty with
regard to pricing and accounting. Therefore, a tariff system setting up a fixed process
how tariffs are determined in terms of scope of application and precise amount would
lead to greater clarity.

75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient
for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
    YES – Please explain
    NO – Please explain

No, the current legal framework does provide for remedies with regard to copyright
infringements committed with a commercial purpose. However, instead of
disproportionate actions against users (as e.g. in the recent “redtube”-case
http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/13/21891592-20000-porn-watchers-
addresses-mistakenly-released-in-german-court-lawyer?lite) the civil enforcement in
the EU should indeed focus on measures against professional infringers (e.g.
provider of copyright infringing downloads or streams). These services are a
necessary condition for any (alleged/possible) copyright infringement by users, or
their action represents the sole act of copyright infringement. As a consequence
those professional infringers should be the first target of any enforcement claims by
rightholders.
This approach does also take into account that the ISP himself is usually neither
infringing copyright himself nor has he any contractual relationship with the infringing
service provider. As a consequence the advocate General Cruz Villalon has written in
his recent opinion on the Case C-314/12 (UPC Telekabel Wien GmbH / Constantin
Film Verleih GmbH und Wega Filmproduktionsgesellschaft GmbH) that it is not
excluded to file a claim against the ISP, but it should be the last resort and the
rightholder should in the first place address his claim to the infringing service
provider, if this is possible.

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for
sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers,
advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.)
in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not,
what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]


Fortunately the Commission does stress in footnote 67, that any clarification should
not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce. This clarification is very important, as
the liability regime continues to provide for a fair balance between all concerned
fundamental rights and parties.

When it comes to ISPs the cooperation of internet service providers is possible on a
sufficient scale already under the current Directives. The eCommerce Directive
provides for a notice and take down regime for host providers. The IPR Enforcement
Directive provides for the right of information and ISPs face interlocutory and
permanent injunctions. The right of information (Article 8) has been extensively used
in Germany in order to achieve the disclosure of IP addresses of alleged infringers.

Nevertheless, the question seems to explore how ISPs could be "fostered" to
cooperate even more. However, enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights should
not be seen as the sole solution. A more holistic view is necessary, focusing on how
to increase offers and consumption of legal content and not just on facilitating current
infringement claims. Attractive offers are key to increase legal consumption. As an
example, films should be made available much sooner after the theatrical release
date. This requires a rethinking of the release windows mechanisms. In a recent
study published by Spotify one of the questions was examining the impact of holdout
strategies on sales and illegal torrent volumes. The result was that “artists who
delayed their release on Spotify suffered higher levels of piracy than those who did
not”. (Spotify report: Adventures in the Netherlands: Spotify, Piracy and the new
Dutch experience). The availability of the most recent content from legal sources
online would therefore be a very effective tool to reduce copyright infringements.



77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance
is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other
rights such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?

Yes. The IPR enforcement Directive, as well as the other underlying Directives
2001/29/EC (Copyright in the information society) and 2000/31/EC (eCommerce
Directive) have indeed been adopted before a reference to the European Charter of
Fundamental Rights was introduced into the Lisbon Treaty. However, since then the

                                                                                      12
ECJ has provided sufficient guidelines how to interpret the Directives in the light of
the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Charter (e.g. Cases C-70/10 "Promusicae",
C-275/06 "SABAM"). The ECJ has stipulated the necessity to strike a fair balance
between the protection of copyright and the protection of the fundamental rights of
individuals, who could be affected by enforcement measures. The latter are the
freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators ISPs pursuant to Article 16 of
the Charter and the fundamental rights of that ISP’s customers, namely their right to
protection of their personal data and their freedom to receive or impart information,
which are rights safeguarded by Articles 8 and 11 of the Charter.

The Advocate General Villalon in his opinions delivered with regard to the Joined
Cases C-70/10 and C-314/12 has touched upon a further important element which is
the question of a concrete legal basis necessary in case the enforcement measure is
restricting fundamental rights (same line of thought: Joined Cases C-293/12 und C-
594/12, Digital Rights Ireland, Seitlinger u. a.).

This is indeed a very important point as it guarantees a democratic process and
debate before imposing measures like filter systems or blocking obligations on ISPs.
In a recent judgement in Germany (21.11.2013 OLG Hamburg 5 U 68/10) it has
been confirmed that any measure imposing blocking or a filter mechanism on an
access provider in Germany must be based on a law defining in detail how the
access to the infringing content should be impeded.

We would like to highlight another crucial aspect concerning the application of the
right of information of the IPR Enforcement Directive, which is particularly relevant
with regard to the protection of personal data.

For Deutsche Telekom it is of utmost importance, that the right to information can
only be claimed in the framework of a judicial proceeding. In Germany the
implementation in Section 101 para. 2 and 9 UrhG (German Copyright Law) does
only allow the access provider to provide the relevant data after a judicial order.

Art.8 IPR Enforcement Directive does allow for such an approach and should not be
questioned. In our opinion the involvement of a judge ensures the right balance
between data protection rights and the right to information of legitimate rights owners.

This is very important as very often the personal information obtained by the Right to
Information is used to address a written warning letter asking to cease the
wrongdoing and to pay for the damage occurred. In case the addressed alleged
infringer returns the signed declaration to cease and desist and does pay the
demanded damage a further judicial proceeding is not taking place.

It has severe consequences in case the access provider has to judge himself
whether the rights owner has the right to sue or not and as a consequence is
claiming legitimately the data requested. Very often the examination of the right to
sue is very difficult, due to complex licensing systems. Additionally, the right of
information is increasingly used fraudulently by rights owners stemming from the
adult content scene. The risk to fraudulently use the right to information would even
gain more importance in case the decision, whether a right to information exists
would not be taken by a judge.

                                                                                        13
80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.

Clarification that the cable retransmission as defined in the Council Directive
93/83/EEC has to be interpreted in a technologically-neutral way.

The technical development has led to new transmission platforms with regard to the
distribution of audiovisual content. For example a retransmission of live TV channels
over the Internet and mobile communication networks to stationary devices (e.g. Set-
top-Boxes, PCs) as well as to mobile devices (e.g. Tablets, Smartphones) is
possible.

The Satellite and Cable Directive 93/83/EEC and the national implementation laws
(e.g. Section 20b German Copyright Act / Section 144A of the Copyright, Design and
Patent Act 1988), have the intention to facilitate the acquisition of the cable
transmission right by cable operators (e.g. acquisition of the rights from a single
source (collecting societies), the licensing of the retransmission right cannot be
prevented or blocked by an individual copyright holder, same terms and conditions
for all market participants, obligation to contract).

The District Court of Hamburg denied in the so called “Zattoo Case” in 2009
(Decision from April 8, 2009 (Az. 308 O 660/08)) the applicability of Section 20b of
the German Copyright Act with regard to the transmission of live TV channels over
the Internet, although the transmission was done over a cable system. Therefore, it is
controversial in Germany, if the simultaneous, unaltered and unabridged
retransmission of an initial broadcast via a transmission path which is not cable or
microwave (e.g. via the Internet or mobile communication networks) is covered by
Section 20b of the German Copyright Act. The crucial point of the dispute is the
question whether or not Section 20b of the German Copyright Act has to be
interpreted in a technologically-neutral way. There is no obvious reason, why similar
services (the transmission of live TV channels to end user for reception on end user
devices) should be treated in different ways. The interest situation between a
traditional cable operator and a Service Provider is absolutely identical. The specific
transmission path (e.g. Mobile Networks, Internet) should be irrelevant. All cases
where a live TV Channel is transmitted simultaneous, unaltered and unabridged
should be considered as a “cable” retransmission within the meaning of the Directive.

The legal situation in Austria is clear since the Decision of the Austrian Oberster
Gerichtshof from August 28, 2008 (Ob 89/08d). In this decision the court made clear,
that the wireless retransmission of live TV channels over mobile networks on mobile
devices has to be considered as a “cable retransmission”. Although Section 59a of
the Austrian Copyright Act is based on the same Directive, different legal opinions
exist in Europe.

Therefore there is a need to clarify on an European level that the Directive has to be
interpreted in a technologically-neutral way in order to ensure that scenarios (e.g.
retransmission via the Internet / Mobile Networks), which are comparable with the
traditional cable retransmission, are treated in the same way with regard to the
acquisition of the rights. Otherwise, it will be difficult to establish cross-border TV
services in Europe.
                                                                                      14
Furthermore, it seems advisable to reconsider the “dogmatic” approach (and
specifically its fundaments) governing the classification of ways of exploitation based
on a distinction between initial and secondary/subsequent communication of works
(or other protected subject matter) to the public. As a general line of reasoning, once
a work or other protected subject matter has been “published”, the right holder should
be under an obligation not to discriminatory frustrate user’s interest in participating in
further acts of communicating to the public.

In particular, it appears worth evaluating whether the existence of different regimes
relating to different forms of secondary use remains justified. In this respect, it
appears that the model chosen for the transmission via cable networks (e.g.
acquisition of the rights from a single source (collecting societies), no blockade by an
individual copyright holder, obligation to contract)as determined in the Satellite and
Cable Directive 93/83/EEC could function as a valid starting point without, however,
allowing relevant rightholders to start managing this system at their own discretion. In
other words, management of rights via collecting societies must be comprehensive
and compulsory.
