Public Consultation 
on the review of the EU copyright rules


Please identify yourself:

Name: 
Prosveta Sofia Publishing House
 with 120  employees and annual turnover of 5000000 euros is a member of the Bulgarian Book Association and supports the Associations  position concerning the following issues. 

Type of respondent (Please underline the appropriate):

        
Publisher/Producer/Broadcaster 
        
Other (Please explain):
I.      
Access to your content across Europe
A.      
Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe? 
1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?
? YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)

? NO

? NO OPINION

3. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned. 
I almost always grant multi-territorial licences, which is the rule in the book publishing sector. 
5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)? 
? YES  Please explain by giving examples

? NO
There are rarely reasons to restrict access to my e-books. 
? NO OPINION

7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
? YES  Please explain 

? NO  Please explain
This is not necessary for the book publishing sector.

? NO OPINION

8. Is the scope of the making available right in cross-border situations  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  sufficiently clear? 

? YES 
? NO  Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach The objective of implementing a country of origin approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).)


? NO OPINION
 
9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could aclarification of the territorial scope of the making available right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent aninfringement of his/her right.)?
? YES  Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


? NO
? NO OPINION

10.  [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you? 
? YES  Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")


? NO
? NO OPINION

4. Download to own digital content 
14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
We cannot imagine that e-books will be re-sold and lent under an exception without this having dramatic consequences for our market. There are good reasons re-sale is permissible only for physical books which bear traces of age and use. This is not the case with e-books, which are passed on in perfect condition. Enabling a second hand e-book market would have disastrous consequence for both publishers and readers. 
III.    
Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States? 
? YES  Please explain by referring to specific cases 


? NO 
We do not see any problems, as most of the important exceptions to the benefit of teaching, research, libraries or disabled persons are in place in all legislations across Europe.
? NO OPINION

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions? 
? YES  Please explain by referring to specific cases 


? NO 
This would not be compatible with the respect for cultural and national traditions which are an integral part of our authors rights/copyright legislations.
? NO OPINION

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
? YES  Please explain why 


? NO 
The current wording is flexible enough.
? NO OPINION


26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute aproblem?
? YES  Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


? NO 
As a publishing house, we rely on exceptions such as the exception for quotation and then sell books across Europe and to the rest of the world. We have never encountered problems.
? NO OPINION

27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of fair compensation be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
 
It is crucial that exceptions be remunerated. If uses are made across borders, we need to decide which party is to pay,as cross-border uses should not lead to the disappearance of compensations which are owed to authors and publishers for the effect of the exception on the commercial exploitation of our works.
A.      
Access to content in libraries and archives
1.      
Preservation and archiving
28. (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception? 
? YES  Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question. 


? NO 
? NO OPINION
2.      
Off-premises access to library collections

32.  (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across borders,  to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private study?
We have not negotiated such agreements because our books/publications up to now are not bought by these institutions.

3.      
E  lending

36. (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
? YES 
We have not negotiated such agreements because our books/publications up to now are not bought by these institutions.
? NO 
? NO OPINION

B.      
Teaching
42.  (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
? YES  Please explain 


? NO 
? NO OPINION

44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they? 
We have direct licences with every school for the use of our content for illustration for teaching. 


C.      
Research

47.  (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
? YES  Please explain 


? NO 
? NO OPINION

49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for research purposes? How successful are they? 
We have direct licences with universities for the use of our content for illustration for teaching. For example we have a contract with the faculty of pedagogy in the Trachian University of Stara Zagora as well as the faculty of pedagogy in the University of Plovdiv. 
D.      
Disabilities 
50.  (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across borders?
? YES  Please explain by giving examples


? NO 
? NO OPINION

52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content? How successful are they?
Thanks to ePub3, we are now able to make many more e-books accessible. 

E.      
Text and data mining
53. (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?
? YES  Please explain 


? NO 
Upon request from bona fide non-commercial researchers, publishers are already granting authorisation for TDM. We grant licences under standard terms and at no additional cost. We may also allow TDM for commercial players but different licensing terms would apply.

? NO OPINION

55. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

Supporting STM initiatives such as Cross Refs Prospect. (http://www.crossref.org/).

57. Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?
Setting up of a specific technical environment for TDM can be a challenge and an expense (such as an APIs allowing the researcher to download the content before mining it). An exception will not be helpful in managing technical issues. 

F.      
User-generated content
58. (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?
? YES  Please explain by giving examples

? NO 
? NO OPINION
59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?
? YES  Please explain


? NO 
Our work benefits from the ISBN. When we create a work based on a pre-existing work, either we rely on the quotation or parody exception or we clear the necessary rights with the original rightholders. We have always proceeded in this way and believe that no change in legislation is needed.

? NO OPINION


IV.     
Fair remuneration of authors and performers
73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)? 
? YES  Please explain 


? NO 
There are already good provisions in place ensuring that contracts are balanced and not abusive. Contract law is a national competence and we do not see any need to create an EU contract law covering copyright contracts.
? NO OPINION

V.      
Respect for rights
75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
? YES 
We are generally satisfied with the current legislation, but there is still room for improvement. 
Publishers could benefit from a presumption of ownership based on the assignation of rights by their authors. This would help them to have a locus standi to be able to take legal action against infringers. We are not in favour of taking action against individuals, but would support targeting illegal websites.
Websites which infringe copyright may seem non-commercial, but there are frequently signs that these sites are in fact making a considerable amount of money (e.g. advertising).
? NO  Please explain 



? NO OPINION

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
We would find it beneficial if some intermediaries such as advertisers, payment services, domain name registrars and search engines who benefit from pirate websites and piracy in general would be encouraged to cooperate more in efforts to stop illegal activities.

77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved between the right to have ones copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data? 
? YES  Please explain 


? NO 
Both important rights should be respected, but one should not take precedence over the other, and we dont accept a right to remain anonymous when committing an offence.

? NO OPINION
