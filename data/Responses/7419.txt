   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?

Das Territorialitätsprinzip des Urheberrechts steht meiner Meinung nach dem
Zugang zu Online-Diensten nicht im Wege.


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.





3. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial  licences?
Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per  year  and  provide
examples indicating the Member State, the sector and  the  type  of  content
concerned.

5. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold  all  the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still  find
it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions  on  a  service
provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to  certain  content
is not possible in certain European countries)?

wird. ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

7. Do you think  that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) are needed  at  EU  level  to  increase  the
cross-border availability of content services in the  Single  Market,  while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


x YES – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….Ja. Einer der wesentlichen Gründe für
nicht ausreichende Möglichkeiten des Rechteerwerbs – aus der Perspektive
der privaten Nutzer – liegt darin, dass Werkvermittler wie Bibliotheken
oder andere Einrichtungen der Wissensvermittlung, insbesondere
Einrichtungen, die von der öffentlichen Hand getragen werden oder
gemeinnützigen Zwecken dienen, nicht über die finanziellen Mittel verfügen
oder diese nicht bereit stellen wollen, die erforderlich sind, um den
Urhebern, Künstlern und anderen Rechteinhabern eine angemessene Vergütung
für die Nutzung ihrer Werke zu garantieren. Solange bei der Finanzierung
öffentlicher Aufgaben lediglich die „Hardware” und das Personal ausreichend
bezahlt werden, für Content aber nichts oder nur wenig übrig bleibt, wird
dieses Problem nicht zu lösen sein.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


      [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


2 The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
   situations  –  i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders   –
   sufficiently clear?


€ YES

x NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])
Die Richtlinie ist in der Formulierung des Rechts nicht ausreichend klar.
Es handelt sich um ein zweistufiges Recht, das aus der Bereitstellung des
Werkes und dem Abruf besteht. Verdeutlicht werden sollte, dass jeder
Eingriff in einen der beiden Akte eine Rechtsverletzung des Making-
Available-Rechts (des Rechts der Zugänglichmachung) darstellt. So können
Rechtsverletzungen, die im ersten Akt in einem Land außerhalb der EU
beginnen, dort sanktioniert werden, wo der zweite Teil der Nutzung, der
Abruf, im Bereich des EU-Rechts erfolgt, sprich im Land des Abrufs. Mit
einer Klarstellung der Richtlinie wird auch erreicht, dass der Nutzer weiß,
dass er bereits beim ersten Nutzungsschritt das Nutzungsrecht für den Abruf
erwerben muss.

€ NO OPINION




   9. In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the
   territorial scope of the “making available” right have an effect  on  the
   recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you  are  considered  to  be  an
   author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights
   or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including
   the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


x YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

Ja, denn dann würden in jedem Fall der Rechtsverletzung im Territorium der
EU die in den Richtlinien definierten Schutzvorschriften zu Gunsten der
Urheber bei der Verfolgung der Rechtsverletzung angewendet werden können,
auch wenn der Bereitstellungsakt in einem Land außerhalb der EU bzw. des
EWR erfolgt ist.

3 Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right  holder:]  Does  the
application of two rights to a single act of economic  exploitation  in  the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


x YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Ja. Die Aufspaltung der Nutzungsrechte, die aus der Systematik des
Urheberrechts folgt, ist für viele Nutzer nur schwer nachzuvollziehen, wenn
sie dazu führt, dass die Rechte nicht aus einer Hand vergeben werden,
sondern bei zwei unterschiedlichen Lizenzgebern eingeholt werden müssen.

4 Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or  other  subject
matter protected under  copyright,  either  in  general  or  under  specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why

Die Setzung von Hyperlinks, die lediglich zu anderen Websites führen,
sollte keiner rechtlichen Regelung unterfallen, die diese Praxis behindern
könnte. Damit wird nur auf geschützte Werke hingewiesen, die auf einer
anderen Website im Rahmen des geltenden Rechts zugänglich gemacht werden.
Sie erleichtert die Nutzung des WWW, ohne Urheberrechte zu tangieren.
Anders verhält es sich mit der Übernahme von urheberrechtlich geschützten
Inhalten – ganz oder teilweise – von einer Website in eine andere
(„Framing”) ohne entsprechende gesetzliche Grundlage bzw. Ausnahmeregelung.
Diese Praxis verletzt Rechte der Urheber der übernommenen Inhalte und
sollte unterbunden werden bzw. Gegenstand einer Lizenzierung sein

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)

5 Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).


   14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What
   would be the consequences of providing a  legal  framework  enabling  the
   resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market
   (type of content) concerned.


[Open question]

Die Legalisierung des Weiterverkaufs von digitalem Content ohne die
Möglichkeit der Urheber, Künstler und Rechteinhaber, hierfür eine weitere
Vergütung zu fordern bzw. ein Verbotsrecht geltend machen zu können, würde
das Verbreitungsrecht ausdehnen und die wirtschaftlichen Interessen der
Urheber und Rechteinhaber nachhaltig schädigen. Auswirkungen auf die
Festsetzung des Erstverkaufspreises wären unausweichlich, fraglich ist
aber, ob die Konsumenten dies akzeptieren würden, zumal nicht alle
betroffen sind. Rechtsstreitigkeiten wären unausweichlich. Denkbare
Konsequenz wäre eine Änderung des Preissystems, bei dem bereits beim
Erstverkauf bei Bedarf die zukünftigen Weiterverkäufe lizenziert und in den
Preis einbezogen werden würden. Hierfür wäre aber die Verwendung von DRM-
Systemen erforderlich

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?

  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]

Die Registrierungspflicht als Voraussetzung für die Entstehung des
Werkschutzes würde dem internationalen Recht widersprechen und wird von uns
abgelehnt. Ein Registrierungssystem, das die Rechteverwaltung und
Lizenzierung unterstützt, kann sinnvoll und hilfreich sein bei einigen
Repertoires wie dem der Musik, in dem schon heute eine zentralisierte
Rechteverwaltung erfolgt, die eine Registrierung der Werke voraussetzt.
Deshalb arbeiten die musikalischen Verwertungsgesellschaften an einer
weltweit operierenden Datenbank, die die nationalen Registrierungssysteme
vernetzt.
Angesichts dieser Situation könnte die Einführung einer
Registrierungspflicht als Voraussetzung für die Lizenzierbarkeit das
überwundene Privilegiensystem auferstehen lassen.Der Verbraucher/Nutzer
könnte annehmen, dass nur diejenigen Werke geschützt sind, die registriert
wurden, während alle anderen frei zugänglich sind.
Entsprechende Vorschläge wurden bereits von Kritikern des Urheberrechts
entwickelt, mit dem Ziel, den Schutz drastisch zu reduzieren. Das kann
nicht im Interesse der EU liegen, deren Kulturwirtschaft auf dem Content
basiert, den die Kreativen erarbeiten. Registrierungspflichten für
privilegierte Nutzer, denen der Zugang zu Werken durch Gesetz erleichtert
wird, wie bei verwaisten Werken ist dagegen sinnvoll, weil sie den
Rechteinhabern hilft, ihre Werke zu identifizieren und ihre Ansprüche bzw.
ihre Rechte geltend zu machen.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[31].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[32].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[33], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[34],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[35].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

21. Are there problems arising from the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
    exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the
    Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

Die unterschiedliche Ausgestaltung von Ausnahmevorschriften in der EU ist
primär Ausdruck der kulturellen Traditionen, die von Land zu Land
unterschiedlich sind. Sie sollte nicht in Frage gestellt werden, zumal die
wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen dieser Unterschiede in den meisten Fällen
nicht gravierend sind.
Allerdings sollte die grenzüberschreitend wirtschaftlich wichtigste
Ausnahme zur Ermöglichung privater Vervielfältigung sowie der
Vervielfältigung zu sonstigen eigenen Zwecken (Privatkopie) dringend
vollständig und verbindlich harmonisiert werden. Hier handelt es sich um
ein System, das den Nutzern und den Bürgern der EU unkomplizierten sowie
kostengünstigen Zugang zu Werken aller Art zum Zwecke der Vervielfältigung
zum privaten und in manchen Ländern auch zum sonstigen eigenen Gebrauch –
für den freien Beruf und die Forschung – verschafft.
Zugleich dient es dem Bildungs- und Wissenschaftssystem, weil es die Basis
für Lehre und Unterricht garantiert: den freien Zugang zu geschützten
Werken. Gleichzeitig bildet die für die Nutzung gezahlte Vergütung eine der
wesentlichen Erwerbsquellen für Urheber und Künstler.
Wichtig ist es angesichts der finanziellen Dimension des Systems, gleiche
Marktbedingungen für die abgabepflichtige Industrie zu schaffen. Es erweist
sich, dass in diesem Bereich von Land zu Land bestehende Unterschiede – in
manchen Staaten werden keine oder nur skandalös niedrige Vergütungen
gezahlt – von der Wirtschaft nicht verstanden werden bzw. dazu benutzt
werden, das gesamte System zu diskriminieren. Dies ist auch schädlich für
die ausländischen Urheber, deren Werke in den jeweiligen Ländern genutzt
werden. Es liegt im gemeinsamen Interesse von Urhebern, Künstlern und
Rechteinhabern sowie der Industrie, dass die Ungleichheiten, die derzeit
von Land zu Land bestehen, beseitigt werden und ein gleichmäßig hoch
entwickeltes, zu angemessenen Vergütungen führendes System erreicht wird.

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[36] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[37].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[38].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1 Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

 32. (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]
Die Rechteinhaber, auch ich, würden ihre Werke in größerem Umfang zur
Verfügung stellen, wenn sie sicher wären, dass die dafür erforderlichen
Vergütungen gezahlt werden. Im Zusammenhang mit dem MoU für vergriffene
Bücher haben sich in Deutschland die betroffenen Parteien auf eine

   3. E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

36. (c) [In particular if you are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

      4. Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[39].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[40].


40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting  to
engage  in  mass  digitisation  projects,  a  right  holder,  a   collective
management organisation:] Would it be necessary in  your  country  to  enact
legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the  agreements
concluded between libraries and collecting  societies)  have  a cross-border
effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[41]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.

   D. Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[42]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [43].

The Marrakesh Treaty[44] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50. (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?

F. User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[45]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[46].


58. (a) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to create disseminate  new  content  on  the  Internet,
including across borders?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples

Bei der Beurteilung des User Generated Content sind drei rechtlich
unterschiedliche Situationen denkbar:
1. Der Nutzer verwendet geschützte Werke: In diesem Fall benötigt er eine
Lizenz.
2. Der Nutzer verändert oder bearbeitet ein vorbestehendes Werk: In diesem
Fall benötigt er ebenfalls eine Genehmigung.
3. Der Nutzer schafft ein eigenes Werk auf der Grundlage eines
vorbestehenden Werks, das er als Ausgangspunkt nimmt (§ 24 deutsches UrhG):
In diesem Fall ist er frei, das Werk zu nutzen, und schafft ein eigenes
neues Werk.
Eine Lösung für die Fälle 1 und 2 könnte darin liegen, dass durch eine
spezielle Ausnahmevorschrift die Nutzung erlaubt wird, solange sie zu
privaten Zwecken auf der Website des Plattformbetreibers (z.B. bei Youtube)
erfolgt und der Betreiber dieser Plattform, die die Nutzung ermöglicht, zu
einer pauschalen Abgabe verpflichtet wird. Das System könnte nach dem
Vorbild des Systems der Vergütung für private Vervielfältigung ausgestaltet
werden.
Auf diese Weise könnte für die rechtstreuen Nutzer eine Situation
geschaffen werden, in der sie auf legaler Basis nutzen, und die
Rechteinhaber würden durch die Abgabe kompensiert. Unserer Ansicht nach ist
diese Lösung den Nutzern leichter vermittelbar als jede Lizenzlösung, bei
der ein Nutzer selbst tätig werden und die Lizenzgebühr für jede einzelne
Nutzung entrichten muss, ohne beurteilen zu können, ob er überhaupt
lizenzpflichtig geworden ist.

      V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[47] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[48]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72. [In particular if  you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms)  to  ensure  that  you  receive  an
adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?

[Open question]
Die Basis für faire Vergütungen sind faire Verträge zwischen Urhebern und
ausübenden Künstlern auf der einen und Verwertern auf der anderen Seite. Im
Regelfall sind die Urheber und Künstler die schwächeren Vertragspartner,
denen die Bedingungen oft einseitig diktiert werden, sofern keine
Tarifverträge oder Vergütungsregelungen bestehen, die verbindlich und
einklagbar sind.
Es ist deshalb sinnvoll, zur Stärkung der Urheber und Künstler in
Situationen, in denen keine Tarifverträge bestehen, Regeln aufzustellen,
nach denen Vergütungsstandards und Vertragskonditionen, die fair sind,
formuliert werden müssen.
Das deutsche Gesetz enthält derartige urhebervertragsrechtliche
Vorschriften, deren Durchsetzbarkeit jedoch noch Defizite aufweist. Dennoch
haben sie in einigen Fällen schon zu vertraglichen Vereinbarungen geführt,
die die Situation entspannt haben. Es wäre wünschenswert, dass die EU
diesen Vertragsverhältnissen im Bereich des Urheberrechts und im Rahmen
ihrer Zuständigkeiten größere Aufmerksamkeit widmet, um unter Wahrung der
kulturellen Vielfalt in ökonomischer Hinsicht gleiche Voraussetzungen in
den Mitgliedsstaaten zu schaffen und zu verhindern, dass die kulturelle
Produktion in bestimmten Mitgliedsstaaten nur deshalb billiger ist, weil
die Urheber und Künstler schlechter bezahlt werden. Dies kann zu einem
„race to the bottom” führen, der im Binnenmarkt nicht gewünscht ist.

    VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[49] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[50].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[51]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[52].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

75. Should  the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
efficient  for  infringements  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
purpose?

76. In particular, is the current legal framework   clear  enough  to  allow
for  sufficient involvement of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet  service
providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,  domain  name
registrars, etc.)  in  inhibiting  online  copyright  infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would  be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries?

77. Does the current civil  enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected  and

personal data?

      VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU  Copyright  Title,
as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and  exceptions
to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the  EU?
Does the current level of difference  among  the  Member  State  legislation
mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]
Nein, es wäre unnötige Kraftvergeudung zu versuchen, ein einheitliches
Urheberrecht zu schaffen, und dies würde mit Sicherheit zu einer Absenkung
des  Schutzes auf dem niedrigsten Niveau führen.
Die EU sollte vielmehr ihren derzeitigen Urheberrechtsstandard
international verteidigen und insbesondere darauf hinwirken, dass der
Schutz des Urheberrechts als entscheidende Kraft zur Erhaltung der
kulturellen Identität der Mitgliedsstaaten international gestärkt und
verteidigt wird. Dies gilt insbesondere auf der Ebene der WIPO, aber auch
und gerade in den derzeit geführten Verhandlungen über ein
Freihandelsabkommen mit den USA  (TTIP)

[10]   Proposal for a Directive  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the
Council of 11 July 2012 on collective management of  copyright  and  related
rights and multi-territorial  licensing  of  rights  in  musical  works  for
online uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
[11]    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role  in  the
management of online rights for musical works in contrast to  the  situation
where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as  film  or
record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

[15]   For possible long term  measures  such  as  the  establishment  of  a
European Copyright Code (establishing a single title)  see  section  VII  of
this consultation document.
[16]   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and  of  the  Council
of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of  certain  aspects  of  copyright  and
related rights in the information society.
[17]   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and  of  the  Council
of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs.
[18]   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.
[19]   Film and record producers, performers and  broadcasters  are  holders
of so-called “neighbouring rights” in, respectively, their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[20]   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[21]   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication  to  the  public
by wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making  available
to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[22]   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[23]   The objective of implementing a “country of origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[24]   Injunctive relief is a temporary or  permanent  remedy  allowing  the
right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.
[25]     Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International)   and
C-279/13 (C More entertainment).
[26]    Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd). See
also http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-
cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.
[27]   See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
[28]   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29]   For example, it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[30]   On the basis of Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of the TRIPS Agreement (Trade  Related
Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2)  of  the  WIPO  Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2)  of  the  WIPO  Copyright  Treaty
(1996).
[33]   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of  minor  importance
for analogue uses existing in Member States  at  the  time  of  adoption  of
Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
[34]   With the exception  of  certain  limitations:  (i)  in  the  Computer
Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii)  Article  5(1)  in
the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
[35]   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan  Works  Directive
(a mandatory exception to copyright and related rights  in  the  case  where
the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary  work  –  for
instance a novel – is considered an orphan work  in  a  Member  State,  that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States  and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.

[40]   France and Germany have  already  adopted  legislation  to  back  the
effects of the MoU. The French  act  (LOI  n°  2012-287  du  1er  mars  2012
relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe  siècle)
foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher  in  question
opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption  of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are  not  members
of the collecting society.

one's own video to a pre-existing sound  recording),  or  adding  one's  own

two sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic  work  (report,
review etc.) in a blog.
