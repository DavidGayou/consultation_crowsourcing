    I.      Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management2 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services3; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.

   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS BY UMP INTERNATIONAL LTD:

Context of the consultation:

The Internet has brought a new method of distribution for musical works. However, the
underlying process of creation followed by a commercial transaction in return for exploitation
remains the same, regardless of the distribution platform. The creator’s need for fair
remuneration for his effort, provided for within a robust copyright framework remains in the
same way that it always has.

The music industry has already seen many changes in distribution formats, from vinyl records
to cassettes to CDs and now to digital downloads and streams. A key function of the music
publisher has been and continues to be that of securing fair payment for the creators we
represent for digital provision of music to consumers as well as for physical product. Better
opportunities now exist for consumers in terms of greater availability of catalogue but as for
so-called new opportunities for creators and right holders, consumers still only need one copy
of each product choice. The objective of the copyright framework should not just be about
making the user environment easier. Equal weight should be given to the interests not only of
the consumers but also the creators whom the food chain relies on. Only by maintaining the

  For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a European Copyright Code (establishing a single
title) see section VII of this consultation document.

                                                                                                             5
correct balance between these interests can the creative process be sustained to power a
successful digital market.

Accordingly, the copyright framework needs to be carefully respected because even though
distribution methods change, the exploitation of copyright should require a chain of
commercial licensing transactions resulting in fair remuneration to creators and right holders
which can only be protected within a strong copyright framework.

Reference is made to the response to this Public Consultation submitted by the International
Confederation of Music Publishers. Universal Music Publishing fully supports all responses
made by the ICMP in addition to the specific comments made by UMP in this submission.

We would be pleased to meet with the Commission to discuss and further expand upon any of
UMP’s answers to the questions raised in this Consultation.



1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – .
  NO OPINION


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

   NO As a right holder, we are fully prepared to license on a multi-territorial basis (see our
answer to question 3). Making UMPG repertoire available across the EU is an essential part
of our business strategy. For a number of business reasons that do not relate to licensing,
online services in the vast majority of cases elect to stagger their roll out on a country by
country basis.
Licensing solutions have met these services’ requirements and the consumer in Europe is
provided with access to over 37 million tracks embodying repertoire from all Member States
                                                                                             6
in more ways than ever previously envisaged, including free to the consumer. UMP
repertoire is included within the Armonia licensing project which now represents 6.5 million
works for use in 32 countries
Music services do provide portability across borders for consumers when travelling or living
abroad. During the Licences for Europe consultation working group on territoriality, it was
demonstrated that the main music services have made almost all international and local
repertoire available in every EU country. At no point during that consultation process was it
substantiated that a territoriality problem existed for music that required a legislative solution.


  NO OPINION


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
As a music publisher we are constantly asked for licences by music services of all types for
the use of musical works on a multi-territorial basis. The territory of the request depends on
where the music services intend to launch. We are happy to grant these licences for the rights
we control for a fair price. Licences for the use of UMP repertoire have been granted to all of
the big music services on a multi-territorial basis including iTunes, Youtube, Google, Spotify
and Amazon.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]


We support the EU Directive on Collective Rights Management which we believe will assist
with the aggregation of society controlled repertoire. We would ask that sufficient time is
allowed to assess the impact of the implementation of this Directive before any further review
is undertaken.
However the key problem faced by legitimate service providers in launching and expanding is
piracy in particular from pirate locker and Bittorrent services. See our answers to questions 75
and 76.
As was demonstrated to the Commission by the group looking at cross-border licensing and
portability within the Licences for Europe process, music licensing is working well, providing
creative industry-led licensing and technological solutions for issues encountered. Licensing
structures are continually being refined further as part of a dynamic market.
The digital services elect when and how to launch, which may be country by country for a
range of commercial reasons.
Rapidly moving licensing negotiations and development of licensing solutions are ongoing
within the existing copyright framework. In addition the framework is subject to continuing
interpretation by the CJEU. We would caution against major revision of this framework

                                                                                                 7
which will interrupt and confuse the success story which is music licensing to date. We are
also concerned about any consequences which may follow from decisions of the Executive
interrupting the work of the independent judiciary.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
   NO – we are fully prepared to grant licences for the full extent of the territory we control
for the rights we own or control although on occasion we may not control the rights for all EU
countries for each author – this is a matter of free negotiation with the author.
  NO OPINION


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
Not applicable.
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO
  NO OPINION


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
No evidence has been provided that demonstrates a need for such a change.
As acknowledged by the Commission in the context of the Licences for Europe process, right
holders in the music sector have already worked hard to implement the existing industry led

                                                                                             8
cross-border licensing solutions to meet the needs of services. As an industry we will
continue to strive to meet these needs in return for fair remuneration.
While licensing solutions are working, full implementation of enforcement measures to help
right holders and legitimate service providers combat unfair competition from pirates would
be welcome.
In addition, we support the ICMP’s call for the Commission to harmonise the discrepancies in
fiscal policies among Member States and the introduction of a reduced rate for VAT for the
delivery of online cultural products.
     NO OPINION

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC8 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software9 and databases10.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders11 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies12, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks13. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of

8
  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
9
  Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
10
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
11
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
12
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
13
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                                 9
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public14. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
We have not encountered and are not aware of any issues in practice. Any necessary
clarifications can and are provided by the CJEU and in licensing terms and conditions.
We would also like to draw a clear distinction between any examination of where a right is
implicated as opposed to any need for an examination of the scope of a right. Since this
questionnaire is asking questions around cross-border transactions it appears to be accepted
that the scope of the making available right is clear since no issues are raised in relation to the
operation of the right in single territory transactions. Our view is that both the country of
origin and targeting approach limit the scope of the right, impacting on licensing and so
should not be brought into consideration if the examination is meant to be focussed in where
an act occurs as opposed to what is encapsulated in a right.


   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach15)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have


14
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
15
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

                                                                                                             10
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief16)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
A clarification would result in a limitation of the making available right. No evidence has
been provided that demonstrates a need for such a change.
We have not encountered any difficulties arising from the differences between national rules
and since no issue has been identified in practise we do not feel there is any need to clarify the
territorial scope of the making available right.
National courts have confirmed that the act of making available occurs in the country where
the server is located and in every country where the server or service is accessed. Litigation
therefore takes place in the country where the infringing act occurs, where the service is
located and in every country where the server or service is accessed by the public. Any
legislative move to a country of origin or targeted approach would interfere with these
established principles and make enforcement of rights more difficult.
Any clarification would also undermine the value of the right as a licensing tool. The country
of origin principle is deeply flawed in that it opens the door to abuse by way of forum
shopping, as concluded by the Commission’s Study on the Application of the Information
Society Directive.
Targeting would be problematic for reasons which include (i) the lack of any clear definition
of the concept of exploitation, so that the target of any exploitation would need to be
addressed on a case-by-case basis leading to confusion and uncertainty and (ii) CJEU case
law has clarified that the act takes place “at least” in the targeted country so that limiting it to
the target approach would go against CJEU interpretation. It is also unclear what should be
done where content is accessed illicitly from a non-targeted third country.

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

   NO – the clearance of multiple rights for the use of content is part of the process in
operating any business based on copyright protected content. Users such as broadcasters have
understood this and operated business practises accordingly for many years. Just because
more than one right is implicated does not mean that there is any attendant problem. These
rights are almost always licensed together.
Music publishers have worked hard with collecting society partners to create streamlined
licensing platforms and licensing “hubs” such as Armonia (presented to the Commission
during the Licences for Europe process) which enable the two rights to be licensed together.
Armonia (which includes UMP repertoire) represents 6.5 million works in 32 countries
covering the works of SACEM (France), SACEM Luxembourg, SGAE (Spain), SIAE (Italy),
the repertoire of Spa (Portugal) via SGAE, Artisjus (Hungary) and Sabam (Belgium). Results
already achieved show that voluntary industry led structures are serving the needs of their
customers in driving a thriving digital market.

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU17 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU18 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
  YES (in specific circumstances)– Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in
general, or under specific circumstances, and why
Hyperlinks to protected works should, in certain circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the rights-holder. This was confirmed by the CJEU in the Svensson case (C-466/12) which
also held that authorisation for linking does not apply to links to copies that have been made
available without the permission of the rights-holder.
The Svensson decision is in line with other cases. For example in the UK Newzbin case
(Twentieth Century Fox v Newzbin ([2010] EWHC 608) where the court found grounds to
block the unlicensed index site “Newzbin”, from which the operators where making available
films to the public by the aggregation of links to infringing content. This case was followed in
Paramount Home Entertainment International Ltd v BSB Ltd [2013] EWHC 3479 (Ch).

In another example, in Germany, the Hamburg High Court ruled against pirate locker service
Rapidshare, (Hamburg High Court, 14 March 2012, No. 5 U 87/09) and found that the making
available of the works occurred when a link to the work was published.
Pirate services, such as those using Bittorrent, are structured to provide aggregated links to
users in order to provide access to infringing content. While pirate locker services rely on
links being placed to the infringing content on their servers. Bittorrent and pirate locker
services are the two biggest sources of infringing content in the EU. It is critical that the law
enables rights-holders to effectively tackle these methods of piracy.
Svensson and the other supporting cases show that a broad definition of the communication to
the public right should be maintained. Otherwise right holders will be deprived of remedies
against these forms of piracy.


   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
It is clear that Article 5.1 of the Copyright Directive already provides for an exception for
temporary acts of reproduction in specific circumstances and specifically where the act has no
independent economic significance.


   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

4.      Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further

                                                                                                13
distribution of that tangible article)19. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)20. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
Not applicable – this act is illegal.
     YES – Please explain by giving examples

     NO
     NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
The making available and reproduction rights are not subject to exhaustion. Creating an
exhaustion doctrine would be incompatible with the 3 Step Test.
The consequence of a digital first sale exception would massively distort the primary market
for the sale of musical repertoire conflicting with the normal exploitation of works and
unreasonably prejudicing rights holders’ interests. To allow for reselling of perfect copies
millions of times would effectively legalise file sharing. The fact that the second copy made
in the act of selling on would be (i) instantly transmissible and (ii) provide a perfect
reproduction of the original product with no way to prove its derivation and (iii) with no way
to ensure that the original copy had been destroyed shows that reselling in the digital space is
not comparable with the analogue world. The copy would be as desirable as the original and
a digital first sale exception would allow for the distribution of unlimited numbers of copies
with no compensation to the creator.
There is no demonstrable need to change this by the introduction of a digital first sale
exception.

  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              14
C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute21. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered22.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
   NO – unless the system is voluntary and is not a pre-condition for obtaining copyright
protection. We acknowledge the desirability of accessible ownership information for musical
works, which is why UMP has been at the forefront of the GRD project which will provide a
single authoritative global source of rights ownership information for musical works.
However, to introduce registration as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights
would cut directly across Article 5(2) of the Berne Convention (which states that the
enjoyment and exercise of copyright shall not be subject to any formality) and unfairly
disadvantage individual creators and SMEs who may struggle to find the resources to
participate in a registration system. The GRD will provide the solution to the need for
ownership information without the need to go further.

16.        What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]

17.        What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system? – the creator could
           potentially be deprived of the just rewards due from the effort of creation from any
           compulsory system as a result of not being able to successfully navigate through a
           registration process. This would be an unnecessary and unfair advantage to the
           operators of services which benefit from the creative efforts of others.



18.        What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


21
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
22
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             15
[Open question]


Within a voluntary industry led system for registration such as the GRD, it could be envisaged
that registration may provide a rebuttable presumption of ownership (ie until the registration
was challenged). This could be useful in the context of enforcement of rights. However,
right holders are already incentivised to register works with collecting societies in order to
ensure collection of revenues from exploitation to the extent collectively managed.
Accordingly it is not necessary for the system to be compulsory in order for right owners to be
incentivised to register with GRD (when available) or collecting societies.

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed23, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database24 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition25 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub26 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
Any contribution by the EU to the funding of industry led projects to promote the adoption of
interoperable, internationally agreed identifiers as it has already done with the Linked Content
Coalition, would continue to be welcomed. Also the GRD project to address the need for a
single authoritative source of global rights ownership information for musical works was
instigated by the Commission in 2008 and the Commission’s continued political support and
potentially any contribution to funding would be welcomed by UMP. The GRD is a business
critical tool needed to support the administration of licences granted and will be vital in
driving the growth in the music licensing market.

Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention27 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – longer is needed. Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
We feel strongly that there should be no limit to the term of protection provided by copyright
for all content types. We don’t understand why intellectual property should receive a shorter
period of protection than physical property such as real estate. The creator’s descendants
should benefit from their ancestor’s efforts in the same way as successive generations can
occupy a house bought by their forebears. If at some point a work cannot be traced back to a
creator then the new regime for orphan works recently elaborated by the Commission can be
applied to ensure continued accessibility to all works.

     II.     Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC28.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law29. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.

                                                                                                             17
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)30, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional31, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")32.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain



30
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
32
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           18
This has not proven to cause any issues for us in the operation of our business. In most cases
any variations in exceptions are of no practical significance.
As a practical matter, we are not aware of any difficulties caused to consumers or users as a
result of difference in national approaches to exceptions (which are largely of no practical
importance and in many cases have no cross-border impact).
  NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
No evidence has been provided that demonstrates a need for mandatory implementation or
harmonisation.
As a matter of practise, the main exceptions are already implemented in all Member States.
The optional nature of many of the limitations/exceptions to copyright has not had a negative
impact on implementation.
No exception should be made mandatory or extended in any way where market solutions can
be provided.
  NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
No evidence has been provided that demonstrates a need for any new limitations or
exceptions.

The existing framework has shown itself to be sufficiently flexible in order to allow for the
development of a growing digital economy and does not need to be widened further. There
are no grounds for any new exceptions or limitations.

The industry has already shown that licensing solutions can be developed to allow for the
development of a thriving digital music market (including in relation to so-called UGC).
Creative and innovative licensing which provides fair reward to creators is the fast, flexible
and proper solution for the further development of the digital market – not an expansion of
exceptions.

Solutions already implemented have been based on the established rules and principles of
copyright. To change these rules mid-stream would interrupt the smooth development of the
market introducing confusion and legal uncertainty.

Any derogation from the rights of creators needs to be very carefully considered in an
environment where technology companies use arguments about personal freedom to justify
positions which would increase their profit margins and any weakening of the copyright

                                                                                           19
regime would make the fight against unauthorised services in order to drive a legitimate
digital market even harder.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain why
The existing exceptions already provide for flexibility and this has to be balanced against the
need for legal certainty. The three step test should remain unchanged. Any consideration of
introducing the broad US concept of fair use should be avoided. The interpretation of this
concept in the US relies on 170 years of case law and uncertainties remain. Fair use has been
characterised as “the right to hire a lawyer”.


  NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)




                                                                                            20
The obligation of fair compensation for an act which is subject to an exception established at
national level that requires compensation should arise in the country where harm is done.
Compensation arising from the harm done in any country should be paid to the entity which
holds the rights in that country and be paid by the party causing harm in that country.
However, our view is that recognizing cross border effect to national exceptions is completely
at odds with a list of mostly optional exceptions currently applicable. If a country has not
implemented say private copying or has not provided for a system of compensation, the cross
border effect of the exception could deprive right holders of their rights or of the remuneration
due.

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving33 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions34. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive35.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

We do not see the need for exceptions or limitations. In all cases licensing can provide more
flexible and swift solutions than exceptions.

30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
We do not think a legislative solution is needed.

31.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]

We know from experience that licensing provides the most flexible bespoke solutions to user
requests.



2.        Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across


                                                                                          22
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
  As was demonstrated during the Licences for Europe process, the range and availability in
the EU of a full range of music services, including free to the end user, shows that there is no
issue in the EU in respect of access through licensed solutions.
33.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
There is no need for any exception or extension of any existing exception in this area.
Licensing solutions can be developed which may be collective, flexible and bespoke.
34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
There is no need for legislative intervention.

35.      If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Licensing is the best approach to address all needs in a tailored and flexible way. Examples
include the schemes developed by the Educational Recording Agency in the UK which has
been operating since 1990.

3.       E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain with specific examples
     NO –
The number and variety of existing music services, including free to access on demand
services, shows that e-lending for music is entirely unnecessary. Music leant electronically


                                                                                              23
(which could be copied and retained permanently) would become substitutional for licensed
services causing distortion and damage to the market.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

39.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
The effect of digital lending by libraries is completely different from offline lending of
physical copies. The commercial streaming services such as Spotify are all lending models.
Any library which provides for online lending is competing with the commercial services and
will have the potential to interfere with that market. Industry led licensing solutions have to
be the best approach to ensure correct positioning between the libraries and commercial
services and to ensure that free lending does not undermine the efforts of legitimate services
to grow the digital market.

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing




                                                                                                24
authors and publishers on the other36. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)37.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
   YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
   NO – Please explain
although we would question what is meant by “out of commerce” when it is so easy to begin
monetising musical repertoire digitally
   NO OPINION –.


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
   YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
   NO – Please explain
Licensing is the fastest, most flexible approach. No additional mechanisms are needed.
As pointed out by the ICMP, the MOU on key principles on the digitization and making
available of out of commerce works signed in 2011 was intended to facilitate agreements in
the print sector between the parties such as authors, publishers and libraries, on collective
licensing schemes for the digitization and making available by public institutions of “out of
commerce” printed works (books and journals) first published in the Member State where the
agreement is intended to be signed.



36
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
37
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             25
This is a very specific and sector focussed agreement which cannot simply be extended to
other types of protected content. Our view is that this would be inappropriate to try to apply
this to music where in any event it is unlikely works will be “out of commerce” and in
analogue form.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC38 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain

exception.
     NO OPINION

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The existing exception is fit for purpose and does not require amendment.
44.     We refer to pages 402 – 403 of the Commission’s Study on the 2001 Information
Society Directive which states that the exception under article 5.3(a) for teaching and research
is formulated openly and so would include e-learning within its scope. What mechanisms
exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration for teaching
purposes? How successful are they?

[Open question]
In the UK, successful licensing schemes are already provided by ERA, CLA and PMLL for
the use of music and photocopies of printed music in schools.
45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
[Open question]
A legislative solution is not needed and the successful operation of licensing solutions show
that no exception or extension of any existing exception is necessary in this area.

46.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Licensing is already operating and is the best solution.



C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC39 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?

resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?

49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
Licensing should always be the optimal solution. It is wrong to apply exceptions to an area
with such unpredictable commercial implications and where licences are available from right
holders.

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC40 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 41.

The Marrakesh Treaty42 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?

52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
[Open question]
One example of a successful licensing scheme in this area is that developed by the MPA in
the UK for the copying of printed music for the benefit of visually impaired people by
educational and not for profit bodies and an easy application process operated by the UK
MPA for those wishing to reproduce printed music using Braille and large print formats.
Licensing is the appropriate mechanism to be applied to facilitate accessibility to content.

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics43 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
43
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              29
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”44. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs45. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions46.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?


45
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

The music industry has pro-actively found ways to provide EU consumers with the freedom
to access and adapt copyrighted works in conjunction with other materials and to upload to
licensed services at no cost to the consumer. Licensing solutions to platforms such as
Youtube (granted business to business) are already in place and continue to be developed to
enable the use online of UGC on a cross-border basis. UGC does not create any new issues
for copyright so that the existing aegis is sufficient to deal with the activities of platforms
permitting uploading of derivative works.
Platforms enable users to easily embed UGC content on their own blogs and websites so that
it appears that content is coming from the user’s own site. This means there is no need for
users to post UGC directly on their own blogs and websites and no substantive demand for
such direct posting has been evidenced. There is no evidence that there is an unmet need in
respect of UGC that is causing problems for consumers.
At no point within the Licences for Europe consultation working group on UGC was it
substantiated that a UGC problem existed that required a legislative exception. In fact the
opposite position emerged in that it was clearly evidenced that licensing was meeting
consumers’ needs. Please see also our answers to questions 22, 23 and 24.
The references to freedom of expression in the introduction to this section are not relevant to
music. Freedom of expression does not rely on the use of copyrighted music. The music
industry has a long and proud history of supporting freedom of expression but this has
nothing to do with UGC.
The authorisation of rights owners is important in this area to ensure that composers’ moral
rights can be respected in relation to offensive uses of works and to ensure that platforms and
users cannot unfairly benefit from the use of creators’ original efforts within derivative works.

in this context?
NO – We are actively engaged with our contract partners to ensure that any helpful

60.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you
experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
NO – although we are pleased to see an acknowledgment that creators should be remunerated
for their efforts. What would be completely iniquitous would be for an exception to be
introduced to allow creators of derivative works and the platforms which distribute them to be
remunerated while the original creator goes unrewarded. The current framework allows for
payment to both and this should remain unchanged. Also see our answer to question 61.

61.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The majority of value is being captured through licences already in place. However, there are
some platforms operating who incorrectly attempt to rely on safe harbour arguments (Article
14 of the E Commerce Directive) to avoid taking licences (see our answer to question 75).
Only “truly neutral intermediaries” should benefit from the E-Commerce Directive safe
harbour regime.
Beyond that, the participants in the Licenses for Europe stakeholders’ dialogue were unable to
identify or define any so-called problem caused by the use derivative works in practise.


62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
Our view – as supported by the conclusions of the authors of the Study On the Application of
Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society – is that

                                                                                           33
there is no basis to justify a UGC specific exception. Licensing is already showing that it can
work in reliance upon long standing copyright law providing protection for original works
subject to existing exceptions.

63.      If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]

The market can provide good licensing solutions.
There is no basis for an exception for UGC because UGC does not represent any new
development in terms of the use of derivative works – which have for many years been
created and licensed. The creator’s right to license and receive revenues from these uses
should not be undermined.




 III.       Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying47. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees4849.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions50 in the digital environment?

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
The Copyright Directive is sufficiently clear regarding the scope and application of these
exceptions and allows for sufficient flexibility to respect national culture and conditions.
Recent CJEU decisions have provided additional uniform interpretative assistance. Further
cases are still pending. No further clarification is needed.
Recent case law has confirmed that in those countries where consumers are allowed to make
private copies, right holders have a right to fair compensation. Padawan confirmed that the
act of private copyright must be considered as an act likely to cause harm to the right holder
and so justifying remuneration. We trust that the UK Government will be respectful of this
ruling in its forthcoming legislation.
     NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?51
     YES – Please explain
The music industry’s priority in the digital space is to grant licenses. However there are cases
where rights holders cannot license reproduction and Directive 2001/29 provides clear criteria
for the payment of fair compensation in those circumstances. Possible harm to right holders is
only one factor to be considered when harm is evaluated. Importantly the concept of harm
includes missed licensing opportunities where copies cannot be licensed. The Directive
already states (Recital 35) that no levies are due when the prejudice to the right holders would
be minimal. As a result no further clarification of this issue is necessary.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
We do not think that levies impact the development and functioning of new business models.
There is no evidence we are aware of to support that.
As stated in our answer to question 65, licensing remains the preferred route wherever
exclusive rights can be effectively exercised. There is no justification for an exception where
an activity is licensable. Accordingly within cloud services, it is possible to license the right
to copy from an online source such as a website to a cloud storage facility. This is very
different from copying from an offline source such as a CD to an MP3 player which is

  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on

unmanageable in real terms and so is the subject of an exception in some jurisdictions. There
would be neither need nor justification for the extension of a private copying exception to
include cloud services. UMPG supports and has already licensed a number of music services
based on cloud technology.
67.    Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?52
     YES – Please explain
We can see this being of advantage to the payer and the payee. This would help to ensure that
the levy is applied in the right place and also to try to ensure there is no avoidance of
payment.
     NO – Please explain

     NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments53.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.

may arise.
We refer to the Stichting de Thuiskopie and Amazon cases, where the CJEU pointed out that
Article 5(2)(b) imposes upon Member States which have introduced the private copying
exception into its national law an obligation to ensure that fair compensation is effectively
paid to right holders residing in its territory. In cases of distant selling, the Court established
that this obligation to compensate the right holder cannot be excluded by reason of the fact

71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
The several recent judgments by the CJEU have provided some important clarifications
relating to private copying levies. We are confident that the CJEU can provide clarifications
to address any further issues which may be raised in the future.
We refer to the response of UK Music to this question, highlighting issues with recent
proposals made by the UK Government which infringe mandatory European legislation.

     IV.       Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers54 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract55. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant

     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
55
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                           37
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
It is of prime importance that users of music fairly remunerate creators. It is unacceptable for
a user to build a business off the back of others’ efforts without paying for that effort. It is the
primary responsibility of a right holder to negotiate with all parties using the repertoire we
represent to extract fair value for the composers. The best mechanism for this is the free
negotiation between right holder and user with the right owner able to refuse to grant a licence
if a fair price cannot be agreed. We continue to strive to gain fair value for the creators we
represent.

Legitimate services which pay right holders (and so creators) can only compete with free if
right holders are given strong tools to protect against illegal uses of their repertoire. A
vigorous digital market can only exist within a robust enforcement framework to enable us to
fight against piracy. Strong enforcement measures are a key mechanism to ensure creators are
fairly remunerated.

The relationship between music publisher and composer is entered into freely under
transparent auditable agreements which are fully negotiated with the support of specialist
legal and business advisors in a fiercely competitive market. The freedom of choice available
to a composer remains the key protection for a composer to ensure adequate remuneration
under songwriter agreements.


73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain why
The music publishing market already self-regulates through the choice of representative(s)
available to the composer. There are no barriers to entry to the music publishing market and
as a result there are many thousands of music publishers operating in the EU vying for
repertoire to represent.

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]
We would caution against any interference in the freedom of parties to negotiate with each
other to reach a mutually agreed outcome. Any imposition of terms and limitation on the
parties’ ability to do business together in innovative and bespoke ways will only have a
stultifying effect on the evolution of songwriter agreements which need to be able to evolve to
take account of the every developing business environment.
We are in favour of freely negotiable transparent contracts supported by competition and
choice.

     V.     Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE56 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text57. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose58. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure59. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
The Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EC) is ten years old and with the huge development of
the internet and piracy it is no longer sufficient to deal with the problems faced by rights-
holders and in particular where piracy is carried out cross-border and often operated from
outside of the EU. The EU has a huge piracy problem so clearly the current enforcement
system is not providing rights-holders with all the necessary tools to tackle piracy which is to
the detriment of the EU economy. The Enforcement Directive needs to be revised and updated
to reflect the challenges of piracy that have arisen over the last decade and protect the EU
economy and its’ creative talent in particular from Bittorrent and pirate locker services. In
respect of the reference to “commercial purpose” we would also point out that there are also

56
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
57
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
58
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
59
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           39
piracy services which operate on a non-commercial basis (ie: do not generate revenue from
advertising or payment providers) but cause the same damage to content owners.
 The impact of insufficient legislation has meant that piracy is significantly damaging the EU
in a number of ways in particular piracy:
(a) damages the EU economy and is responsible for significant job losses. We refer you to
Tera Consultancy’s March 2010 study “Building a Digital Economy: The Importance of
Saving Jobs in the EU’s Creative Industries” (“Tera Study”), which found that in 2008, the
EU’s creative industries that were most impacted by piracy (film, TV series, recorded music
and software) experienced retail revenue losses of €10 billion and losses of more than 185,000
jobs due to piracy.
(b) reduces sales, revenue and therefore taxes paid by legitimate business. As an example we
refer you to the Smith/Telang study “Assessing the Academic Literature Regarding the
Impact of Media Piracy on Sales” (2012).
(c) Between 2000 and 2012 global music sales have fallen by 40% predominately due to
piracy.
(d) restricts the revenues available for investment in new artists and the resulting development
of cultural diversity.
(e) reduces revenue to authors and performers.
(f) inhibits the start-up of new EU businesses in the music sector.
(g) Limits the potential growth of existing businesses (including EU based services such as
Spotify, Deezer and WIMP). When launching in iTunes the late Steve Jobs stated that
iTunes’s biggest competitor was piracy not other legal services.
Non-Intermediary Legislative Enforcement Changes
Legislative changes are clearly needed. Set out below are the legislative changes needed that
do not relate to intermediaries. Set out in the response to Q.76 are the legislative changes
needed in respect of intermediaries.

(i) Article 8(3): EU wide implementation.
Article 8(3) (Directive 2001/29/EC) has not yet been properly implemented in all Member
States and this process needs to be completed as a matter of EU law and to protect rights-
holders.
(ii) Article 8(3): Cross-border injunctions.
Pirate services operate globally and typically have links to a number of countries either via
hosting providers, server locations or operator locations. This has resulted in rights-holders
having to take multiple actions within multiple EU territories (for example in the case of The
Pirate Bay). Clearly within the EU there should be the ability to have injunctions from one
Member State enforced in another directly or by expedited procedure.
(iii) Article 8(3): Expedited Procedure.
Injunctions can take significant time and cost to obtain and implement during which the
infringements continue to cause significant damage. As a result expedited procedures should
be available.
(iii) Article 8(3): Improvement of effectiveness.


                                                                                             40
Pirate sites often uses technical measures to circumvent Court sanctioned injunctions (for
example by changing IP/DNS addresses). For example this is something that The Pirate Bay
has done on a regular basis. The relief should also apply catalogue wide to all current and
future repertoire such that once the original infringements have been established it is not
necessary for rights-holders to continually bring actions against the same pirate site for
continued infringing acts.
In addition where injunctions are granted EU ISPs, on an EU wide basis, should be required
to terminate any hosting accounts for the injuncted pirate service.
(iv) Damages.
The level of damages needs to be increased to a significant level in order to achieve their
original intent of sufficiently detering infringing operators and compensating rights-holders
for the damage caused to them.

  NO OPINION

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
NO
The current legal framework is not clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of
intermediaries who are central in assisting with the inhibition of digital infringements. Pirate
services use a range of intermediaries to deliver and support pirate content in the EU such as
search engines, advertising networks, payment providers, hosting companies, ISPs and
domain registrars. These intermediaries will often benefit financially through their interaction
with the pirate services and therefore from the underlying infringements. EU businesses
should not be providing support to pirate services. As such the areas below need to be
addressed.
Intermediary Legislative Enforcement Changes
(a) Enhanced co-operation from intermediaries
The intermediaries referenced above need to provide assistance in tackling piracy. In
particular key steps include the following:
(i) search engines should stop directing consumers to infringing content or services while
prioritising legal services.
 (ii) advertising networks/advertisers should not serve adverts to infringing sites, which
provides them with revenue;

                                                                                             41
(iii) payment providers should not provide financial services to pirate sites; and
(iv) App stores should remove Apps which are designed to facilitate piracy.


(b) Protection only for truly neutral intermediaries.
The ECJ has established that protection against liability should only be granted to “merely
technical, automatic and passive” services, in other words true neutral intermediaries. Truly
neutral intermediaries merit protection however many pirate services that do not fit this
criteria, such as pirate locker services, attempt to benefit from the safe harbour protection.
They are designed at a structural level to infringe copyright, it is their business model. They
rely on their ability to continually re-post infringing content faster and in greater volumes than
can be notified by rights-holders.
(c) Updating of public databases by ISPs and identification of pirate service operators
In order to take effective enforcement action under EU law rights-holders need the ability to
correctly identify the infringing party operating the pirate service. Most pirate services
deliberately provide fake details or hide behind shell companies based outside of the EU.
They will also typically move from one ISP to another quickly and as such ISPs need to have
an obligation to keep accurate and up to date the public databases (such as Domain Tools and
RIPE).



77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain


The Enforcement Directive supported by CJEU case law already provide for the requirement
for balance between the right for private life and data protection. Specifically, Recital 32 of
the Enforcement Directive states that “it respects the fundamental rights and observes the
principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union”.

    VI. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the

copyright protections.
