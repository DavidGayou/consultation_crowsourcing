                          INTEL CORPORATION RESPONSE TO


                         EC Public Consultation
                 on the review of the EU copyright rules

                                       February 2014


Intel Corporation appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback on the EU copyright rules.

    I.   Intel’s Commitment to the EU

Intel Corporation (Intel) is the world’s largest innovator and manufacturer of semiconductors,
with approximately 105,000 employees in over 500 offices in more than 58 countries and net
revenues of over €37 billion. From the creation of the first Intel microprocessor in 1971,
which sparked a digital revolution that forms the backbone of today’s global economy,
innovation has been central to Intel’s operations.
                                                                            1
Intel’s focus on using technology to change the world remains strong. Importantly, for Intel,
it is not so much about the products we make as it is about what our products make possible.
Intel’s declared mission statement is to create and extend computing technology to connect
                                                              2
and enrich the lives of every person on earth in this decade.

Intel’s commitment to Europe is equally strong. Intel began its European operations in 1972,
only a few years after its founding in 1968.3 With more than 50 R&D locations in 13 EU
countries, the European Union region is central to Intel’s relentless drive for innovation in
computing technology, visual computing, cloud networks, security, high performance
computing, automotive, and mobile communications. For example, Intel’s European high-
performance computing research, carried out in R&D centres in France, Germany, and
Belgium, focuses on building supercomputers with a thousand times the performance of
today’s fastest supercomputers.

Intel also is one of the top 10 industry players in the EU’s funded programme for R&D, has
R&D work aligned with the EU Horizon 2020 Strategy, and participates actively in about 26
cross-border collaborative projects within the EU’s framework programs for research FP 7.
In its efforts to fund smaller inventive companies, Intel Capital has invested more than €1
billion in over 150 companies, including Clear2pay and Amplidata of Belgium, Total
Immersion of France, Sulfurcell and 4titoo of Germany, Adaptive Mobile Security of Ireland,
VisionOSS of the U.K., Layar of Netherlands, Tobii of Sweden and Media Lario International
S.A. of Italy.

   II. The Intersection of Technology and Content Protection

As the owner of a vast array of copyrighted works, Intel is acutely aware of the importance of
protecting copyrights as an incentive to creativity and innovation. The convergence of
computing, communications, and entertainment platforms has created both opportunities and
challenges for content creators, service providers, device makers, and consumers—
especially with respect to digital entertainment content that can be easily copied and shared
over the Internet. Working closely with content owners, the media sector, device
manufactures, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and others, Intel has helped develop and
deploy technologies to protect content while enabling new digital media business models for
the benefit of both content owners and consumers. For example, Intel helped develop DVD,
Blu-ray, and UltraViolet technologies that have each created new digital media industries and
new consumer experiences. Another Intel technology, HDCP, protects high-definition
content and enables interoperability between billions of displays and source devices and
services. Intel believes that balanced copyright laws can stimulate innovation in both the
content and technology industries, and enable market forces to drive commerce and adapt to
changing businesses and technologies.

In general, Intel believes market forces and private agreements between interested parties,
including content owners, service providers, device manufacturers and technology providers,
not Government mandates, are the best methods to address the unauthorized use of
copyrighted materials. Agreements and market forces, for example, led to the development
of content protection technologies and ecosystems, like those for DVD, Blu-Ray, UltraViolet,
and HDCP, and a host of proprietary schemes for rich and diverse content offerings. Such
creative, market-driven solutions provide protection for right holders and greater flexibility for
consumers as those solutions ultimately are only successful in the marketplace if they also
satisfy consumer demands.

As the EU reviews its copyright laws, Intel encourages it to continue to embrace policies that
stimulate technical innovation, ensure design freedom, and allow horizontal technologies to
flourish.

   I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  NO OPINION


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?



3.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
NO OPINION


4.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  NO OPINION


5.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?



6.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  YES (Market led solutions) – Please explain

                                                                                            5
Intel’s vision of “any content, any time, any place, any device” depends on content
portability and accessibility. Intel has worked diligently with content creators, service
providers, and device makers to drive market-based initiatives that support these
objectives.
New initiatives like UltraViolet mark a new era in portability and accessibility, with
consumers able to download, stream, and move with them content they have purchased.
Intel believes that the market will continue to evolve to dissolve what portability and
accessibility issues remain, and that mandatory legislation is not necessary.



B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
1.      The act of “making available”
7.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     NO OPINION


8.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief4)?
     NO OPINION

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
9.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of
two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
download) create problems for you?


3.      Linking and browsing

10.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?




4
  Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                 6
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
The provision of a hyperlink to a copyrighted work does not involve in itself any existing
exclusive rights (neither the right to reproduction, nor the right to communication to the
public). It is most like a reference, a footnote, in a print work. Hyperlinks are part of the
very nature of the internet and it would be impracticable to subject hyperlinks to any
exclusivity since this would require the permission from a right holder and consequently
could imply remuneration. Intel does not recommend either the creation of a new
exception to copyright as a method to legally linking on the internet without the express
authorisation of the copyright owner. This would not make sense as no exclusive rights
are violated by the linking.




11.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
The viewing of a webpage only involves temporary reproductions exempted from the
reproduction right in Directive 2001/29, Article 5.1. This rule was established to enable
the functioning of the internet which necessarily involves such temporary copies. They
are part of the nature of the internet. As a consequence Intel does not believe that such
temporary reproductions of copyright protected content should require authorisation of
right holders.
The UK Supreme Court decision (NLA v. PRCA, 17 April 2013) correctly held that
temporary copies made in the browser cache and the screen to simply view the content
of a web page are exempted from copyright infringement by the temporary copies
exception of Directive 2001/29.
Such acts of browsing do not have separate economic value on their own and therefore
cannot lead to a loss of profit for the right holders that could justify the creation of a
specific right or the undermining of the Internet.


4.      Download to own digital content
13.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     NO OPINION




                                                                                           7
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
Intel’s vision of “any content, any time, any place, any device” depends on broad
availability of content, including on-line distributions. We recognize that a robust digital
market has security and content protection requirements, and we have worked
diligently with content creators, service providers, and device makers to drive market-
based initiatives that support these objectives (DVD, Blu-Ray, UltraViolet).
New initiatives like UltraViolet mark a new era in consumer online ownership rights,
with consumers able to download, stream, and move with them (among devices and
services providers) content they have purchased online.
Some of the important questions that such a resale right would impose speak directly to
its challenges: should it require registering the successive consumer’s rights? Where
and how should they be tracked? How should DRM interoperability be addressed? How
should the technological protection measures be respected? Should each online seller
have to ensure that each online purchase can be sold to another person? Should be limits
on who can sell and who can purchase?
While mandating provisions on resale of purchased digital media may have appeal, Intel
believes that this should be left to the market and that mandating a doctrine allowing
the resale of online digital media is not necessary or good public policy. It would raise a
host of technical and business challenges not suited to regulatory resolution, whereas
such objectives will be solved by time and market-based initiatives.

C.     Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
  NO
Intel does not believe that a registration system is either necessary or good public policy.
Voluntary market-driven solutions would better enable rights owners and prospective
licensees to accurately identify the right to license and to create a mechanism for bi-
lateral licensing negotiations. As mentioned earlier a mandated system would raise a
host of technical and business challenges not suited to regulatory resolution. These
challenges include registration/tracking of a specific license; interoperability; how
technological protection measures are addressed and how to deal with other rights or
limitations that a copyright owner may wish to grant or impose. Intel believes that the
market will continue to evolve giving consumers’ greater flexibility through use of
developing and soon-to-be-developed technological and market solutions.


16.    What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
NO OPINION

                                                                                            8
17.        What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
NO OPINION


18.        What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
NO OPINION

D.         How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
NO OPINION

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
Intel is a strong supporter of a balanced copyright system, which includes reasonable
copyright terms. Technological changes in distribution of content does not necessarily
impact appropriate terms of copyright protection. We recognize, however, the need for
consistency in international copyright terms as possible. We commented extensively on
this topic in Eldred5.

     II.      Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
     NO OPINION

                                                                                        9
23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
Intel believes a balanced copyright includes reasonable limitations and exceptions, but
we do not believe that limitations and exceptions justify levy systems. Remuneration
for rights holders should be direct, and limitations and exceptions with de minims harm
should be acknowledged as such.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
     NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
NO OPINION

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?



27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

    III.      Private copying and reprography

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions6 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain

6
    Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                                                                                           16
Please see our answer to question #71

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?7
        – Please explain
The license associated to the cloud services covers all uses consumers need to be able to
access digital content from several connected devices, anytime, anywhere. The
reproductions made according to the license can’t be deemed causing a harm to the
right holders that have agreed to grant such an authorisation. Therefor we believe it is
hard to justify the implementation of the complex, burdensome and non-efficient system
of copyright levies into new areas of content delivery and services, such as
cloud services.
Furthermore, applying the levies’ compensation scheme in that context would result in
unjustified multiple payment by consumers for the same content (one for the licensed
content itself, another one for the compensation of the private copy eventually made by
the connected device already subject to levies, and a new one for accessing the content
through the cloud service).

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
The outdated levy systems hinder the establishment of a Digital Single Market within
the EU, and deter the EU from attracting and promoting digital innovation in today’s
global market. The absence of copyright levies in cloud computing would make it more
attractive and less discouraging for innovative companies to develop or implement
platforms in EU providing consumers with new distribution models and ensuring direct
and transparent remuneration for artists.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?8
    YES – Please explain
Intel believes that copyright levies should no longer be concealed from the consumers.
Copyright levies are intended to compensate the right holders for the private copies
made by consumers, therefore they should not be paid by the manufacturer or the
importer. If the latters have been given the obligation to pay levies to the collecting
societies, they are supposed to charge them to the consumers. Therefore is only fair that
consumers know the amount they pay to benefit from the private copying exception

when they buy an ICT device. Nevertheless, the complexity of the copyright levies
systems in the different member states makes it difficult for importers and
manufactures to identify the specific levy attached to a given device at a given moment.
Therefore, the overall mechanism of calculation and imposition of levies would need to
be simplified in order to allow more transparency in their communication to the
consumers.


68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?



69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]
NO OPINION

70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?
[Open question]
NO OPINION

71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
Copyright levies are not suited for the digital world where rights management
technologies broadly enable direct remuneration for rights holders. There are a host of
issues with the various levies systems across the EU, including lack of transparency,
inconsistency in rates and products covered, and a powerful sector with specific narrow
interests.
Economic analysis (Oxera study, Kretschmer report, Enter report…) show that levies
have a material and negative impact on the EU economy, and that the growth of levies
interferes with trade and the flow of goods and services both domestically and
internationally.
While Intel supports efforts to improve the levies systems to address inconsistencies and
transparency (both from collecting societies and visibility to consumers), we strongly
believe that rolling levies back is the best public policy to drive economic growth. We do
not support expansion of levies into new areas of online content delivery and services,
such as cloud services.



                                                                                        18
 IV.     Fair remuneration of authors and performers

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
NO OPINION

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?



74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
Intel supports appropriate remuneration for authors and performers and works
diligently with content creators, service providers, and device makers to drive market-
based initiatives that directly support this objective. Intel believes that negotiated
licensing structures are the best mechanism to ensure compensation of rights. In
addition, copyright levies are not the way to compensate authors for private copying,
because other mechanisms, as direct remuneration through rights management
technologies, are available.

  V.     Respect for rights

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
  NO OPINION

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
Intel supports strong law enforcement to protect copyright holders in a balanced
copyright system. Rights management systems and technological protection measures
are necessary for a robust digital economy, but only law enforcement can address
professional piracy.
Intel does not support Government mandated solutions against online content piracy as
these are ineffective and have a chilling effect on innovation. Moreover, ISPs and
technology provider intermediaries are not in a position to determine what online use is
infringing a given copyright. No filtering technology is capable of making this
determination, and filtering technologies can be circumvented. In addition, Intel does
not support monitoring or policing mandates as the solution against online piracy as


                                                                                       19
these are ineffective, susceptible to circumvention and quickly become outdated due to
technological advances that outpace frozen mandates.
Any such technology mandate would likely negatively impact consumer and privacy
rights. A filtering mechanism would have to track who requested the content, from
whom it was obtained and where it went. In light of the Privacy Directive, this would
place ISPs and technology providers in the dichotomy of having to choose between those
two regimes, placing unnecessary risks on consumers’ privacy.
Rights holders have access to various technologies, often labelled “phishing
technologies” which aid in the collection of evidence of copyright infringement. As with
all technology, circumvention may occur over time or may provide erroneous results,
particularly as new technologies enter the marketplace.
Therefore, even with the purpose to fight against online commercial infringements,
legislation should avoid identifying particular technologies or methods as this may chill
technical improvements and interfere with market demand. The cost of deploying such
technologies is best determined in private agreements between rights holders and ISPs
and should not be imposed by government mandate.
Intel believes that market forces and private agreements are the best way to foster the
development of new consumer offerings and media usages and to protect digital content
consumer interests, including for addressing concerns related to unauthorised file
sharing. Indeed, the only way for technological protection measures to keep pace with
new methods of piracy is to allow the market to move as quickly as the pirates, which
cannot be achieved by legislated technological mandates.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  NO – Please explain
Intel values and respect copyright as well as consumer and privacy rights. The complex
nature of IPRs requires court intervention and oversight to provide appropriate
safeguards. To this end, judicial oversight should be required prior to compelling an
intermediary to provide right holders with personal data of alleged infringers.
Intel believes that the Directive on Electronic Commerce is close to ensure the right
balance, however, it should establish the minimum levels of proof required to obtain a
disclosure user identifying information to right holders.
Under the current E-commerce Directive regime, once rights holders have provided
appropriate evidence of alleged infringement, ISPs are required to notify the alleged
infringers. In order for this process to work effectively and fairly, rights holders and
ISPs should agree on the terms and conditions of such notification, and on a reasonable
cost- sharing mechanism.
If reopened, the E-Commerce Directive should clarify the level of proof necessary to
oblige ISPs intermediaries to start the notification process, and judicial oversight should
be required prior to compelling an ISP to provide the personal data of alleged copyright
infringers to right holders.

                                                                                        20
As a matter of principle, infringement determinations should be left to Courts and not to
ISPs or rights holders. The burden of proof must remain with rights holders, for them to
identify the specific copyrighted work and the alleged infringement. ISPs do not have
such information.
In addition, Intel believes that injunctions should always be ordered within the
framework of the liability regime of the intermediary and fully apply the “no general
obligation to monitor” provision (art. 15 of Directive 2000/31/EC). ISPs must not be
obliged to monitor consumer activities before or after the notification procedure.




    VI. A single EU Copyright Title

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  NO


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
Intel’s vision of “any content, any time, any place, any device” depends on content
portability and accessibility. Intel believes that the market will continue to evolve to
dissolve what portability and accessibility issues remain. In this context, we do not see
the need to create a single EU copyright title.
