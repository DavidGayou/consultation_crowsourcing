   I. Introduction

A. Context of the consultation
Over the last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created, distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content - for
information,  education  or  entertainment   purposes   -   regardless   of
geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy
and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in  2014  on  whether  to
table legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical  industry-  led  solutions  through  the   stakeholder   dialogue
"Licences for  Europe"  on  issues  on  which  rapid  progress  was  deemed
necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[2]. The Commission
welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact that  two  groups  -
user-generated content and text and data mining - did not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of the  legislative
framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication on  Content  in  the
Digital Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to  improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement  while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the
October 2013 European Council
Conclusions[3] "Prov/d/ng digital services and content  across  the  single
market requires the establishment of a copyright  regime  for  the  digital
age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review of  the  EU
copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to  modernise  Europe's
copyright regime and facilitate licensing,  while  ensuring  a  high  level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural
diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings,  in
particular those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[4], the "Green Paper on the online
                           π      ο
distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  and   "Content   Online"   .   These
consultations provided valuable feedback from stakeholders on a  number  of
questions, on issues as diverse as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and
possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to the  online
dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders' remuneration, particularly in
the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by  stakeholders  representing
all stages in the  value  chain,  including  right  holders,  distributors,
consumers, and academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views  on
the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge
Economy" was followed up by a Communication.  The  replies  to  the  "Green
Paper on the online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed  into
subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights  Management  Directive  and
into the current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A. Why is it not possible to  access  many  online  content  services  from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights - e.g. writers, singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead, they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is  limited  to
the territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[5].
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet - e.g.  by
a music streaming service, or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  -  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence,
such that content services can be provided in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights  Management[6]  should  significantly  facilitate  the  delivery  of
multiterritorial licences in musical  works  for  online  services[7];  the
structured stakeholder dialogue
                  12
"Licences for Europe" and market-led developments such as the on-going work
in the Linked Content Coalition[8].
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them  when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives
of the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the further  development  of  cross-
border portability[9].
Despite progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to, services. These problems are most  obvious  to
consumers wanting to access services that  are  made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all online  services  are
available in all Member States and consumers face problems when  trying  to
access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the  "same"
service is available in all Member  States,  consumers  cannot  access  the
service across borders (they can only access their "national" service,  and
if they try to access the "same" service in another Member State  they  are
redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing  of   rights   in   different
territories. Contractual clauses  in  licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or nonlegislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level  in  the  medium  term[10]to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.

1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced  problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than  the
one in which you live?
□ YES - Please provide examples indicating  the  Member  State,  the  sector
and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium  content  such  as  certain
films and TV series,  audio-visual  content  in  general,  music,  e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)
Watching replays of french TV channels that are being paid for in  Belgium.
Music videos on youtube.

□ NO
□ NO OPINION

2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have  you  faced  problems
when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?
□ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g. business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and  newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).

□ NO
□ NO OPINION

3.    [In particular if you are a right holder or a  collective  management
organisation:]
How often  are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial  licences?  Please
indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of  the  questions
above - what would be the best way to tackle them?
As the EU is one big market, distribution rights should be EU based and not
country based. It is a form of discrimination not to let residence of other
EU countries access things online.

5. [In particular if you are a right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all  the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still  find
it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on  a  service
provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain  content
is not possible in certain European countries)?
□ YES - Please explain by giving examples

□ NO
□ NO OPINION

6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the  necessary
rights for all the  territories  in  question,  you  would  still  find  it
necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions  on  the  service
recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to  a  different
website than the one he is trying to access)?
□ YES - Please explain by giving examples

□ NO
□ NO OPINION

7. Do you think that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
including market- led solutions) are needed at EU  level  to  increase  the
cross-border availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
□ YES - Please explain
The copyright industry is not known to move on its own, to innovate, rather
the opposite, The only way to get the industry players to  make  a  pan  EU
license would be to


force them to do so, meaning that any license given  out  would  cover  the
entire EU and not only each individual country.
□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to
be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in  the
digital environment is largely established by Directive  2001/29/EC[11]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of
       17   18
software and databases .
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[12] which are essential for the transmission of digital copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.
The most relevant rights for digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to
                                20
authorise or prohibit the making of copies , (notably relevant at the start
of the transmission - e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work  to  a
server in view of making it available - and at the users' end - e.g. when a
user downloads a digital copy of a  work)  and  the  communication  to  the
public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
                                     21
dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital  networks  .  These  rights  are
intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1. The act of "making available"
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload, the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where the  act  of  "making  available"
takes place. This does not raise questions if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of  "making
available" happen in the country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  "targeting"  of  a  certain  Member   State's
public[13]. According to this approach the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are "targeted"
by the online service provider. A service provider  "targets"  a  group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language  or  a  currency
specifically targeted at that group.
8. Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border  situations
— i.e. when content is disseminated across borders - sufficiently clear?
□ YES
□ NO - Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin"
       23
approach[14])
In the case of the internet it is difficult to speak of targeting a certain
country, considering that most websites are not doing so, only  a  few  big
players do so. Making available from a geographic stand point  should  mean
the country where the content  is  hosted.  Otherwise  a  so  called  court
shopping would happen, in which people/companies would go  to  the  country
that is most friendly to their cause to initiate action.

□ NO OPINION

9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of  the
territorial scope of the "making available" right have  an  effect  on  the
recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author
or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not),
on your remuneration, or  on  the  enforcement  of  rights  (including  the
availability of injunctive relief4)?
□ YES - Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

□ NO
□ NO OPINION
2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right and  the
making available right. This may complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the  two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.

10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:]  Does  the
application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in  the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?
□ YES - Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")
There should not be such a thing as separate licenses for reproduction  and
making available. This only creates more confusion and complications.

□ NO
□ NO OPINION

3. Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the
Internet to another. They are indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are
                    25
pending before the CJEU in which the question has been raised  whether  the
provision of a clickable link constitutes an act of  communication  to  the
public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation  of  the
rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter  protected   under
copyright on the screen and in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[15] as to whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception  for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other  subject
matter protected under copyright,  either  in  general  or  under  specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
□ YES - Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general,
or under specific circumstances, and why

□ NO - Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public - or to a new public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)
The provision of a hyperlink should never be subject to  the  authorisation
of a rightholder. By doing so it would  destroy  the  fundamentals  of  the
internet. An analogy to the analog world would be  saving  that  to  use  a
street one would need permission of the people living on  that  street.  No
sane person would agree to this so there should  be  no  reason  that  this
should be made in the digital world. So it should be covered by a copyright
exception.

□ NO OPINION

12. Should the viewing of a  web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on
the screen and in the cache  memory  of  the  user's  computer,  either  in
general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of
the rightholder?
□ YES - Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general,
or under specific circumstances, and why

□ NO -  Please  explain  whether  you  consider  this  to  be  the  case  in
general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because  it  is  or
should be covered by a copyright exception)
Considering  it  is  only  a  temporary  copy  it  should  never  need   an
authorisation of a rightholder it should always  be  covered  bv  copyright
exception.
□ NO OPINION

4. Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g.
download to own). Questions arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article)[16].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in the
case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
                                             28
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of  the  copy)  .  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a  copy  of  a  work
after they have "re-sold" it - this is often referred to  as  the  "forward
and delete" question) as well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality  that  never  deteriorate
(in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

13. [In particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
restrictions when trying to resell digital files that  you  have  purchased
(e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
□ YES - Please explain by giving examples
When bying a song on itunes one cannot ressell it to a friend.
□ NO
□ NO OPINION
14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a  service  provider:]  What
would be the consequences of  providing  a  legal  framework  enabling  the
resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify  per  market
(type of content) concerned.
[Open question]

C. Registration of works and other subject matter — is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.
                               29
However,  this  prohibition  is  not  absolute  .  Moreover  a  system   of
registration  does  not  need  to  be  made  compulsory  or  constitute   a
precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. With a longer  term
of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital  technology
provides for the use of content  (including  older  works  and  works  that
otherwise  would  not  have  been   disseminated),   the   advantages   and
disadvantages  of  a  system  of  registration   are   increasingly   being
considered[17].

15. Would the creation of a registration system at  EU  level  help  in  the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?
□ YES
□ NO
□ NO OPINION

16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

[Open question]
Knowing exactly where one can apply for  a  license,  and  who  owns  which
rights to which creative work.
17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system? [Open
question]

18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

[Open question]
Even for rightholders this system would be  beneficial,  because  it  would
help them make the works more easily available, thus  increasing  potential
customer bases.

D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held  by
producers, collective management organisations, and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,  internationally   agreed   'identifiers'.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
                                            31···
specific to the sector in which they have been developed  ,  and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers and  databases.
The Global Repertoire Database3 should, once operational, provide a  single
source of information  on  the  ownership  and  control  of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked Content  Coalition[18]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a Rights
Reference Model (RRM) - a comprehensive data model for all types of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[19] is seeking to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.

19. What should be the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption  of
identifiers in the content sector, and in  promoting  the  development  and
interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
[Open question]
The EU should make it mandatory for any rightholder to inscripe in  such  a
database, and make it a necessary condition to be able to be  protected  by
copyright law.

E. Term of protection - is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with  the
applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne

         35
Convention requires a minimum term of protection  of  50  years  after  the
death of the author. The EU rules extend this  term  of  protection  to  70
years after the death of the author (as do many other countries,  e.g.  the
US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in  the
digital environment?
□ YES - Please explain

□ NO - Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

The terms should be limited to a maximum of 10 years with  the  possibility
to expend it another 5 years in extreme cases. This would harmonize it with
the terms of patents. Furthermore any work that is based on  public  domain
works (like many of the Disney TM works)  should  only  be  covered  for  5
years. There is basically no such thing an entirely new book, music,  movie
. All are based to some extent on prior works, to honour those who came  up
with the  prior  works  and  give  others  the  possibility  to  also  base
themselves on this, we need to revert back to a  more  reasonable  term  of
protection.
Furthermore these protections only help big so called gate keepers, studies
have shown that generally the artist and creators of the works are not  the
beneficiaries of such long protection terms.
□ NO OPINION

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable  the  use
of  works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC[20].
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright  laws  have  to
respect international law3 . In accordance with international  obligations,
the EU acquis requires that limitations and exceptions can only be  applied
in certain special cases which do not conflict with a  normal  exploitation
of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably  prejudice  the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU  law  is
exhaustive (no
                                                     38
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised  at  EU  level)  ,
these limitations and
                      39
exceptions are often optional , in the sense that Member States are free to
reflect in national legislation as many or as few of  them  as  they  wish.
Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and  exceptions  is
general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member States  as  to
how, and to what extent, to implement them  (if  they  decide  to  do  so).
Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and  exceptions
included in  the  EU  legal  framework  for  copyright  are  of  equivalent
significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on  the
functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[21].
The cross-border effect of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders. In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are  used
for illustration in an online course given by an  university  in  a  Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of  that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member  States'  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain  uses   the
authorisation of rightholders is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,  and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

21. Are there problems arising from the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for  the
Member States?
□ YES - Please explain by referring to specific cases
Due to the differences in local laws, one creates an almost  unsurmountable
hurdle for the individuals, and small companies. Big companies  can  afford
lawyers and the necessary staff to see through this  barrage  of  different
legislations, however smaller once are not capable  of  doing  so,  meaning
that they are put a huge disadvantage.
□ NO - Please explain □ NO OPINION

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
□ YES - Please explain by referring to specific cases
To simplify the legal mess for SMEs and for individuals.
□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating  what  would  be  the  relative
advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well  as  its  possible
effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.
[Open question]
The introduction of fair use would  help  in  increasing  flexability,  one
could introduce a test for fair use like is done in the  USA.  Furthermore,
copyright should be  revised  every  3-5  years  to  check  whether  it  is
realistic in the current situation.

26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
experience, constitute a problem?
□ YES - Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring
to It creates uncertainty and a too higher burden to enter into a new
market.
□ NO - Please explain why and specify which  exceptions  you  are  referring
to

□ NO OPINION

27. In the event that limitations and exceptions  established  at  national
level were to have cross-border effect, how should the  question  of  "fair
compensation"  be  addressed,  when  such  compensation  is  part  of   the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
Du to the fact that through DRM measures the right to a  private  copy  has
basically been eradicated there need not to be such compensation.

A. Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of  publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of  preservation  and
archiving[22] and enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject
                                     42
matter in the collections of such institutions . The public lending  (under
an exception or limitation) by these establishments of physical  copies  of
works and other subject matter  is  governed  by  the  Rental  and  Lending
Directive[23].

Questions arise as to whether the current framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this  may   cause   to
rightholders. The role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.
1. Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records,  or  films)  -
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works - may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national  laws
allowing for the making of such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of
beneficiary establishments, the types of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.
28. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
experienced specific problems when trying to use an exception  to  preserve
and archive specific works or other subject matter in your collection?

(b) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

□ YES - Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the  type  of  use  in
question.

□ NO
□ NO OPINION

29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Libraries should be allowed to lend out copies of works in both digital and
in hard copy form, there should not be any  distinction.  Furthermore,  any
material used for educative reasons should be exempt from any fees and  any
restrictions of copyright. The reason for granting those exemptions is that
most, if not all work, is derived from previous  works,  and  copyright  is
supposed to be a limited monopoly granted by the people  to  a  creator  to
earn some cash.

30. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions  should
be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]
Libraries need to be able to archive all works that are being published, to
preserve these for the future generations.  The  easiest  most  most  space
efficient way to do so is to do it electronicly, so the legislators need to
make sure that there is nothing in the way to achieve this mission.

31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
2. Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the  consultation  of  works
and other subject- matter (consulting an e-book,  watching  a  documentary)
via dedicated terminals on the premises  of  such  establishments  for  the
purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and
other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user  is  not  on  the
premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally  addressed
in agreements between universities/libraries  and  publishers.  Some  argue
that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,
and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.
32. (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
experienced specific problems when  trying  to  negotiate  agreements  with
rights holders that enable you to provide remote access,  including  across
borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for  purposes  of  research
and private study?
b) [In particular if you are an end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of the
institutions in question?
c)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,  to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research  and  private
study?
[Open question]
B) Yes on several occasions during my studies I  was  not  able  to  access
books. or journals due to the fact that the library could not give acces to
them. This is particularly cumbersome when the only library  that  holds  a
copy of the work is several hundred km away.

33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
All libraries are permited to hold electronic copies of works and thus  can
make them available to for example there student.

34. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions  should
be covered and under which conditions?
[Open question]
Libraries need to be able to archive all works that are being published. to
preserve these for the future generations.  The  easiest  most  most  space
efficient way to do so is to do it electronicly. so the legislators need to
make sure that there is nothing in the way to achieve this mission.


35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]

3. E - lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and  libraries   are
currently experimenting with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced  specific
problems when trying to  negotiate  agreements  to  enable  the  electronic
lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or other  materials
held in your collection?

b) [In particular if you are an end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books  or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending), including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

c)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?
□ YES - Please explain with specific examples
Not being able to lend academic journals for research.
□ NO
□ NO OPINION

37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

Publishers should give a digital copy of there works to the "main" national
library which in turn should send copies to all the different libraries  in
the country. This would reduce shipping cost and make distribution  easier.
By this system any library would also have any work and thus  people  could
access it without any proble.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n0 3) and  the
previous one (n0 2).

38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:]  What  differences  do
you see in the management of physical  and  online  collections,  including
providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?

[Open question]
39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do  you  see
between libraries' traditional activities such as on-premises  consultation
or public lending  and  activities  such  as  off-premises  (online,  at  a
distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

4. Mass digitisation
The term "mass digitisation" is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum  of
Understanding (MoU) on  key  principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in
the normal channels of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors  and
publishers on the other[24].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such  licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting
society or  the  recognition  of  an  "extended  effect"  to  the  licences
granted)[25].

40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to
engage  in  mass  digitisation  projects,  a  right  holder,  a  collective
management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your  country  to  enact
legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements
concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have  a  crossborder
effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
□ YES - Please explain why and how it could best be achieved

□ NO - Please explain


□ NO OPINION

41. Would it be necessary  to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
agreed for  other  types  of  content  (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
collections, broadcasters' archives)?
□ YES - Please explain

□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

B. Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC[26]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation  at
Member States level. The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some
argue that the law should provide for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.

42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or  an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use  works  or
other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including  across
borders?
(b) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
□ YES - Please explain
Legally not being able to  hand  out  copies  of  required  literature  for
universities.
□ NO
□ NO OPINION

43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

archival purposes.


44. What mechanisms exist in the market place  to  facilitate  the  use  of
content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]

45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions  should
be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]

46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

C. Research
                 47
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to choose whether  to  implement
in their national laws a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-commercial
scientific research. The open  formulation  of  this  (optional)  provision
allows for rather different implementations at Member States level.

47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or  an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use  works  or
other subject  matter  in  the  context  of  research  projects/activities,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?
□ YES - Please explain

[Open question]

D. Disabilities
                 48
Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception/limitation for  the  benefit
of people with a  disability.  The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level. At EU  and  international  level  projects  have  been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works  published  in
special formats and facilitating their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [27]

The Marrakesh Treaty[28] has been adopted to facilitate access to published
works for persons who are blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows
organisations for the blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired  persons   without   the
authorisation of the rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50. (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
organisation representing persons with disabilities:] Have you  experienced
problems with accessibility to content, including across  borders,  arising
from Member States' implementation of this exception?
b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for  persons
with    disabilities:]    Have    you     experienced     problems     when
distributing/communicating works published in special  formats  across  the
EU?
c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced  specific
problems resulting  from  the  application  of  limitations  or  exceptions
allowing for the distribution/communication of works published  in  special
formats, including across borders?
□ YES - Please explain by giving examples
So called e-readers are not permitted to have a text to speech feature.
□ NO
□ NO OPINION

51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]
Text to speech feature should not require  a  different  license  then  the
normal viewing of the document.

to content? How successful are they?
[Open question]

E. Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[29] are different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to  e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is made
of the relevant texts and data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or
other subject matter, it is necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whether the main problems arising in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain  "access"  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and  data
mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by

publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe" . In the context of these
discussions, other stakeholders argued that no additional  licences  should
be required to mine material to which access has been  provided  through  a
subscription agreement and considered that a specific  exception  for  text
and  data  mining  should  be  introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of  a
distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying  to
use text or data mining methods, including across borders?
b) [In particular if you are  a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services based  on  text  or
data mining methods, including across borders?
c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced  specific
problems resulting from the use of text and  data  mining  in  relation  to
copyright protected content, including across borders?

F. User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and
distribute content at little to no financial cost. As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the making  of
so-called "user-generated content". While users can create totally original
content, they can also take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and
    53
blogs . User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-
existing  works  even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"  work  does  not
necessarily require a creative  effort  and  results  from  merely  adding,
subtracting or  associating  some  pre-existing  content  with  other  pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not "new" as such. However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is no longer  the  preserve  of  a  technically  and
artistically adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of  expression
and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and  the
users generating the content. In any event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users  were
pledged by rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
"Licences for Europe" discussions[30].

58. (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject
matter to  disseminate  new  content  on  the  Internet,  including  across
borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?
(c) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the Internet,  including
across borders?
□ YES - Please explain by giving examples
Impossible to publish mashups without the fear of huge legal fees.
□ NO
□ NO OPINION

59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right  holder:]
Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you  have

online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?
(b) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
possibilities for users that are publishing/disseminating  the  works  they

□ YES - Please explain

□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


[Open question]
A legislative solution is needed.

62. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which  activities  should  be  covered  and  under  what
conditions?
[Open question]
UGC for non profit use  should  be  exempt  from  copyright.  This  can  be
justified by the fact that collages have been done since it was possible so
have remixes only since "recent " years this seems to be a problem.

63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

 IV. Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[31]. Levies are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a  view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making
copies for their private use) or through use  of  certain  technique  (i.e.
reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the  question  arises
as to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers' licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies
to certain types of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.
64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope  and
application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[32]  in  the
digital environment?
□ YES - Please explain
Due to the fact that rights holders  do  get  levies  there  should  be  no
restrictions on such copies. Like written above a person buying an  MP3,  a
computer and an MP3 player  basically  pays  3  times  for  the  MP3.  Once
actually buying the MP3, then the levy on the computer and finally  on  the
MP3 player. Since this is occurring the person buying the MP3  should  also
have the right to distribute it.
□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

65. Should digital copies made by end users for  private  purposes  in  the
context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where  the
harm  to  the  rightholder  is  minimal,  be  subject  to  private  copying
levies?[33]
□ YES - Please explain

□ NO - Please explain
Considering that the person has licensed the work there should be  no  need
to pay additional levies.
□ NO OPINION

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the  application  to  online
services (e.g. services based on cloud computing  allowing,  for  instance,
users to have copies on  different  devices)  impact  the  development  and
functioning of new business models on  the  one  hand  and  rightholders  '
revenue on the other?
[Open question]
There should not be any levies for cloud based services since people  store
there property on these servers. Since the property is paid for  the  right
holders loose there right to get more paid.

67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible  on  the  invoices
for products subject to levies?[34]
□ YES - Please explain


It would make consumers more aware of how much the  copyright  industry  is
getting.

□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that  context,  not
all Member States have ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of  undue
payments[35].

68. Have you experienced  a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or
other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?
□ YES - Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the  percentage
of the undue payments. Please also indicate how a priori  exemption  and/or
ex post reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.

□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons  other
than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying?  Do
any of those transactions result  in  undue  payments?  Please  explain  in
detail the example you provide (type  of  products,  type  of  transaction,
stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]

70. Where such undue payments arise,  what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
affect?  To  what  extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or   ex   post
reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy  the
situation?
[Open question]
71. If you have identified specific problems with the  current  functioning
of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
Levies are supposed to be applied to memory cards (like SD  cards)  however
these card are mainly used in cameras and cell phones, for the stocking  of
personal pictures and music that has been paid for. There is no  reason  to
pay a levy on things that have been created by the user.

  V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors  or
performers to producers[36] or determining who the owner of the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[37]. This is an area that has been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72. [In particular if  you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to  ensure  that  you  receive  an
adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
License out the right to use the work to a record label or publisher for  a
limited period of time.

73. Is there a need to act  at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?
□ YES - Please explain
It is not possible to to claim the right to a work. Only a limited  license
can be granted.
□ NO - Please explain why

□ NO OPINION

74. If you consider that the current rules are not  effective,  what  would
you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]

 VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE[38] provides for a harmonised framework for the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright  and
related rights. The Commission has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[39].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in
case of infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen
respect for copyright when the infringed content is used for  a  commercial
purpose[40]. One means  to  do  this  could  be  to  clarify  the  role  of
intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[41]. At the same time, there  could
be clarification of the safeguards for respect of  private  life  and  data
protection for private users.

75. Should the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
efficient for  infringements  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
purpose?
□ YES - Please explain
A clear definition of commercial purpose should be  introduced.  I  propose
commercial purpose being: the act of asking money for a copyrighted work.
□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for
sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as   Internet   service
providers, advertising brokers,  payment  service  providers,  domain  name
registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not,  what  measures  would  be
useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
ISPs and other intermediaries should not be held in any way responsible for
what is going on over there lines, this would be a strong  reduction  in  a
persons right to privacy.

77. Does the current civil enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
balance is achieved between the right to have one's copyright respected and
other rights such as  the  protection  ofprivate  life  and  protection  of
personal data?
□ YES - Please explain

□ NO - Please explain
The current framework is largely skewed towards right holders.  Fundamental
rights are  being  taken  away  for  the  profit  of  a  few  multinational
companies. IP addresses should be considered as private data and  thus  not
be allowed to be stored. In certain countries the  making  available  of  a
single song can be seen as a commercial act, this  is  definitely  not  the
case. The problem with copyright is the huge potential  for  abuse.  It  is
defacto the grand of  a  time  wise  unrestrained  monopoly,  covering  the
authors life +90 years.
□ NO OPINION

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States' legal systems.

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU  Copyright  Title,
as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions
to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
□ YES
□ NO
□ NO OPINION

79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the  EU?
Does the current level of difference among  the  Member  State  legislation
mean that this is a longer term project?
[Open question]


VIII. Other issues

 The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the
 most important matters relating to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
 copyright. Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
 appreciate if you could bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
 properly addressed in the future.

 80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework
 for copyright? Please explain and  indicate  how  such  matters  should  be
 addressed.
 [Open question]
 Sharing of copyrighted works between  private  individuals  should  not  be
 considered an infringement of copyrights.
 The term theft should not be used in conjunction of copyright,  because  no
 actual theft can occur. One of the necessary conditions for theft to  occur
 is that the victim looses something, however  in  terms  of  copyright  the
 victim cannot loose anything if an unauthorised copy is made of a work, the
 victim still has his/her copy of the work and did not loose it.
 Copyright should only apply to acts of commercial nature.

28    In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a secondhand  licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder's
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on  the  Computer  Programs  Directive.  It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

29    For example,  it  does  not  affect  "domestic"  works  -  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.

[12]  Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of
so-called "neighbouring rights" in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,

referred to as a "work" or "works", while content protected by neighbouring
rights is referred to as "other subject matter".

accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
