80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright?
    Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.

PPL welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Public Consultation on the Review of the EU
Copyright Rules (the “Consultation”).

With regard to Questions 1 to 80 (inclusive) of the Consultation, PPL supports the
position adopted in the Consultation response submitted to DG Internal Market and Services
on 5 March 2014 by UK Music, of which PPL is a member.

PPL refers in particular to the UK Music answers to:

   Q1-Q7, regarding the availability of online, cross-border licensing solutions under
    the existing EU copyright framework. For digital services using sound recordings,
    much of this licensing is undertaken directly by PPL members, on a pan-European or
    even global basis. However, PPL does for example license a range of broadcasters for
    elements of their services that are available outside the UK. Further, VPL (which carries
    out the equivalent role to PPL in the UK, in relation to music videos) licenses MTV to use
    independent music videos from 13 European CMOs in 61 MTV channels, broadcast from
    27 countries into a footprint of 117 countries.

   Q23, regarding the importance of objective evidence when considering copyright
    limitations and exceptions. PPL believes that a robust evidence base should be a pre-
    requisite not just when considering exceptions but for any potential future proposals to
    update European copyright law. PPL notes that the UK Government states that it
    strongly believes in this principle, in its own submission to the Consultation.

   Q72, regarding fair remuneration of authors and performers, and the importance of
    an effective copyright system in which the rights of creators are upheld and
    enforced. PPL believes that any potential future proposals to update European
    copyright law would need to appropriately protect the rights of creators – including,
    amongst others, performers and sound recording copyright owners. Again, PPL notes
    that the UK Government states that it strongly believes in this principle, in its own
    submission to the Consultation.
