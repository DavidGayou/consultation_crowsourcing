RESPONSES TO THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION QUESTIONS


Question 2: Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across
borders in the EU?

YES - The fragmentation of the European digital market is mainly the result of the
commercial practices put in place by rights-holders operating in the EU, who prefer to
commercialize their rights on a country-by-country basis, rather than with a
continental scope, in order to maximize profits. Thus, this is an artificial fragmentation,
because there are no legislative, physical or technological barriers impeding or
prohibiting the provision of cross-border digital services. This situation seriously
frustrates the emergence and the development of an integrated single market for
online content, unlike the US, where there is a huge development of cross-border
digital offers. The material advantage of the US market with respect to the EU is that in
the US, Video on demand (VOD) and online rights are distributed using a ‘one-stop
shop’ approach for the whole territory with no territorial exclusivity, which has
allowed several players competing on quality of service and business models to
emerge. In Europe, by contrast, the rights-holders’ commercial practices work quite
differently:

a) Licensing of content by rights-holders (major studios, independent producers, and
   broadcasters) is, in fact, still managed at national level based on the concept of the
   territorial exclusivity. This means that when acquiring the content for a given
   country, for instance, a VOD operator can only make the content available in that
   given country and has to put in place Digital Rights Management (DRM) measures
   (geo-filtering of IP addresses) to prevent EU citizens living in different member
   states from acquiring that content. A provider wishing to establish a cross-
   national/pan-European EU VOD service, and thus exploit the low distribution costs
   entailed by digital distribution, would need to negotiate and sign a specific contract,
   in each given territory for each content item in the library. This is due to the fact
   that online rights are still in many cases managed as part of a bundle with other
   forms of distribution (broadcasting for instance) which are traditionally linked to a
   territorial dimension.

b) The territory-by-territory acquisition of rights means not only that different libraries
   are available for each territory, but also that different economic conditions, retail
   prices, availability dates and usage limitations are attached to the rights. This is a
   consequence of the conditions under which the rights are negotiated being set by
   the local branch which grants the rights. This creates another important barrier to
   the establishment of pan-European digital services, as it is extremely difficult for a
   digital operator to explain to its users why a specific content is available only in




                                            -2-
   some countries and, when the content is indeed available, why different prices and
   conditions apply.

   Note that the European Commission (DG COMP) has recently (13 January 2014)
   opened an investigation covering such type of commercial practices with the aim of
   investigating whether the latter may amount to an anti-competitive behaviour.

c) Beside the above issues, the impact of the collective rights management system on
   the digital single market is also relevant, as it creates additional licensing
   complexities. In practice, even when rights are acquired by on-line platform
   operators for each country, a further territory-by-territory clearance must be
   carried out by the national based Collective Management Organizations (CMOs).
   The relevance of the restrictive behaviour of collecting societies was confirmed by
   the European Commission in an antitrust decision in 2008.

   As a result, under the current system, although most digital content could in
   principle be easily distributed through an online platform for consumption by the
   entire European continent, it is in practice subject to multiple deals and to clearance
   28 times through 28 different CMOs. All such deals involve transaction costs and
   potential restrictions which dramatically hamper the roll-out of cross-border
   services. This frustrates and impairs the initiatives and business activities of
   innovative and competitive players which, should those obstacles not be present,
   could easily develop online content offers with a continental scope, making full use
   of the capabilities of the Internet protocol and the wide presence of broadband and
   high-speed connections.



Question 7: Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border
availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level
of protection for right holders?

YES – A comprehensive review of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright in the
Information Society would be needed along with clear measures specifically aimed at
putting an end the current restrictive licensing practices. The copyright framework
should evolve to reflect the evolving consumer habits and needs which, in light of
technology developments, demand access to content anytime, anywhere and through
any platform. E.g. a recent judgement of the European Court of Justice (sentence C-
355/12 Nintendo / PC Box srl of January 23, 2014) has considered as legitimate
behaviours which were previously seen as prohibited (piracy). This shows that without
prejudice to the legitimate rights of authors, creators and their distributors, it is clear




                                            -3-
that the copyright framework must evolve in order to stay fit for purpose in the
changing digital environment. See also the reply to Question 21 below.



Question 8: Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations –
i.e. when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

The territorial scope of the “making available” right may have the effect of legally
sealing the current partition between national territories within the EU for copyright
purposes. Also for this reason, the EU should have the ambition of harmonizing
copyright law and thus creating a single EU territory for copyright purposes.



Question 10: Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic
exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

YES – Measures aimed at making the licensing process less burdensome would be
beneficial, including the legal “bundling of rights”, provided that this does not generate
anti-competitive incentives for the licensing body, which should ultimately always seek
maximum distribution along with efficient revenues.



Question 11: Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances,
be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

NO - A hyperlink is a reference to data that the reader can directly follow to find an
already available content. The function of hyperlinks is to link any information to any
other information over the Internet; they are therefore integral to the creation and
functioning of the World Wide Web. Technically speaking, a link is not a transmission
or communication of a work but a reference to an already available work. The fact is
that sharing hyperlinks on the internet is one of the most common activities. Requiring
the authorisation of a rightholder before sharing a hyperlink would not only be
cumbersome but also undermine the fundamental right of free speech.

We note the recent decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the
Svensson case (case C466/12 Nils Svensson and Others v Retriever Sverige AB)
whereby hyperlinking was considered an act of communication to the public pursuant
to the Copyright Directive (Directive 2001/29/EC). However, the court has specified
that, in the concrete circumstances of the case, which concerned the provision on a
website of clickable links to works which were freely available on another website,




                                           -4-
copyright protection would not apply and, therefore, authorization from the rights
holder would not be required.

ECTA welcomes the decision taken by the court in the concrete circumstances of the
case, however disagrees with the principle that a simple hyperlink could be considered
as an act of communication pursuant to the Copyright Directive. The legal
interpretation of the European judges is clearly attached to the current wording of the
Copyright Directive, which was conceived in an era where social networking and
content sharing models could not even be imagined. Therefore, the European
institutions should clearly intervene in order to adapt the notion of “act of
communication” to the evolving needs of the digital economy.



Question 12: Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the
screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under
specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rights-holder?

NO - Viewing of web-pages is a widely accepted, general practice and part of the
everyday life of users all around the World. If the act of merely viewing a website,
without downloading or printing, would be subject to copyright, many people would
likely infringe copyright while browsing the internet and coming across websites
containing copyright protected material.2

Although the normal use of the Internet involves the creation of copies, this is the
automatic result of browsing the Internet. The making of such copies in the cache is
indispensable for efficient web-browsing and therefore in line with Article 5 (1) of the
Directive 2001/29/EC. The copies retained on the screen or in the cache are merely the
incidental consequence of the use of a computer and are temporary. Furthermore, as
suggested in the opinion of the UK Supreme Court “(…) it has never been an
infringement, in either English or EU law, for a person merely to view or read an
infringing article in physical form(…).”3



Question 20: Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
digital environment?

NO – The current terms are excessively long and are nowadays a crucial limitation to
the availability of content online. The term of 50 years after the death of the author

prescribed by the Berne convention of 1886 are not fit for the digital environment,
which has the unlimited potential of dissemination of cultural material. The ‘70 years
after the death of the author’ term of protection provided by the EU constitutes an
even greater impediment to the dissemination of copyrighted content, without
providing any additional incentives to produce cultural work.

Shortening the term of protection tat least to the minimum 50 years provided by the
Berne Convention would create a competitive advantage to EU enterprises creating
and distributing content as they would gain accessibility to 20 years of currently
protected material.

Question 21: Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member
States?

ECTA believes that the European copyright legislation, which is currently in force,
needs to be revised in order to allow for improvements and harmonisation of rights
and protection systems and in order to adapt the latter to the development of the
Information Society. Some more ‘traditional’ copyright rules risk being unable to keep
pace with the changes in the way intellectual property circulates over communications
networks.

Furthermore, the exhaustive list of strictly defined exceptions lacks flexibility to adapt
to the changes occurring in a rapidly evolving environment for content, creation,
access and distribution.

In the interest of all stakeholders, it is essential to offer the broadest, most reasonable
and predictive scope to the exceptions in Article 5, under the condition that these be
read within the context of the three-step test described in Article 5.5.



Question 22: Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

YES - The number of exceptions presented in Articles 5.2 to 5.5 of Directive
2001/29/CE should be made mandatory (instead of optional) whenever those
exceptions are effectively necessary to protect and ensure the fundamental rights of
citizens, the effective availability of digital content as well as proper cross-border
circulation of such content.




                                            -6-
Question 23: Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed
from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

Considering the large size and increasing number of user-generated content, failure to
adapt the copyright regime to the digital era risks creating a situation where activities
perceived as normal by users are made illegal. This would undermine the credibility of
copyright law among average users and would also threaten the interests of rights
holders.

In order to clearly recognise the difference between the use of protected material as
part of user-generated new content and illegal file sharing of a work, it would be
necessary to adapt the copyright regime in order to include audiovisual content which
incorporates users’ creative output, and in this way creating a completely new work.



Question 24: Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and
exceptions?

See answer to Question 21 above.



Question 64: In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
application of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital
environment?

YES – There is a need to rethink the entire private copy model because the current fair
compensation mechanism provides for abuses and competitive distortions which
impair the growth of broadband and digital services. The European institutions should
therefore consider whether a fair compensation mechanism is still needed and
therefore start working on a phasing out roadmap.

In any case, we note that the implementation of the private copies regime is very
diversified within the EU. There are important differences at EU level with regard to
the devices subject to private copies fees: e.g. in some countries you have to pay fees
for memory cards, for parts of hard disks, Mp3, mobile phones, set top boxes (storage
devices) whereas in others you do not4. Moreover the levels of the fees are quite
different at EU level - revenues coming from private copies are higher in Germany and
France than in other European countries, and even vis-à-vis non-European countries.5

                                                     -7-
This reality may encourage a sort of “grey market” deployment. It is therefore crucial
to harmonize practices and fees all over Europe at a level which supports the creation
and use of new digital equipment.



Question 65: Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the
context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to
the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?

No, licensed copies should not trigger the application of levies. According to Recital 35
of Directive 2001/29/EC, “In cases where rightsholders have already received payment
in some other form, for instance as part of a license fee, no specific or separate
payment may be due.”

Making these digital copies subject to levies would create a situation of double
payment. This would harm end users’ expectations, who assume that licences acquired
by service providers will cover all relevant acts related to a given licensed service,
including reproduction by the end user.



Question 66: How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online
services (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have
copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new
business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

As recognized in the 2013 recommendations of Antonio Vitorino on Copyright Levies
“Usually, a service provider acquires a license from the rightholder that covers all
copyright relevant acts involved in the provision of the service, including the
reproduction of copyright protected content by the end user. Such licensing agreements
also reflect the view and the expectations of the end user. A person paying for e.g. the
download of a song expects that this payment does not only cover the first download of
that song onto his or her personal computer but also the subsequent copying of that
song to a certain number of his or her mobile devices, as determined by the usage rules
of the service provider. Similarly, a person subscribing to a music streaming service is
usually not only paying for the online streaming to his or her device/s but also for the
possibility to create "playlists" that can be listened to when "offline". […]”

Thus, private copying levies should not be applied to cloud services to the extent that
the copies are made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that




                                           -8-
has been licensed by rights-holders. Additional remuneration in the form of private
copying levies is not proportionate and should not be required.

A different approach would create uncertainty and competitive distortions since the
entire Internet and the main services provided through the Internet (e.g. email, social
network, platforms) can be considered as part of the cloud.

In addition, it is worth noting that because of technical progress, memory capacities in
devices are increasing rapidly. Still, the ability of users to consult and watch all the
contents that can be stored is not unlimited. Moreover, the increase in capacity is not
only due to an increase in the volume of content available but also to increases in the
quality of the content that is stored. Consequently the related fees should not merely
increase with storage capacity but should depend on the actual use of the content by
users. The level of fees should only be defined after serious and comprehensive
surveys on actual use of content are carried out.



Question 67: Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
for products subject to levies?

YES - Making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies would, on the
one hand ensure a trusted relationship with the user and on the other hand, the
transparency of the system would also contribute to better remuneration of authors.



Question 75: Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more
efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

ECTA considers that the current legislative framework - Directive 2004/48/EC on the
enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRED) as it currently stands and the E-
Commerce Directive (Directive 2000/31/EC) – provides rightholders with very effective
instruments to protect their rights and to address in particular online IPR
infringements. Unlike the Copyright Directive, the IPRED contains checks and balances
for enforcement and ensures that the protection of IPR is balanced with fundamental
rights and freedoms.6 Furthermore, the IPRED also provides for injunctions against
intermediaries whose services are used by a third party for any proven IPR
infringement, and lays down the minimum legal conditions that must be adhered to by
national courts when formulating injunctive measures.

This said, it should be noted that injunctions are expensive, time consuming and the
source of legal uncertainty for ISPs. ECTA’s members have experienced a dramatic
6
  Freedoms of expression, the free movement of information, the protection of personal data - see paragraphs 2 and 15
of Directive 2004/48/EC and Article 2 (3) (a) of Directive 2004/48/EC.



                                                        -9-
increase in the use of injunctions and blocking orders, particularly in Italy and Bulgaria,
and the impression is that the use of this tool, while being so useful for copyright
holders, may risk being abused. To give an example, ISPs are in some Member States
frequently requested not only to block traffic to certain sites but also to divert such
traffic to police servers, which requires the application of further resources in order to
comply with the injunctions terms. Another difficulty is the uncertainty of the scope of
application of the warranty. It can be unclear from the terms of the injunctions
whether ‘transiting traffic’ is or is not included in the requirement to block, particularly
where that traffic is not EU originated or terminated. In addition, injunctions can be
highly resource consuming (both in terms of human resources and capital expenditure)
and, depending upon the solution implemented, run the risk of degrading the quality
of service. Finally, the implementation costs are relevant and therefore there is room
to discuss whether rightsholders should share the costs.

To sum up, it should be ensured that the scope of injunctions and the technical
standards for implementation are common within countries and across the EU.



Question 76: In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for
sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers,
advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in
inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what
measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

YES - Articles 9 and 11 of the IPRED already introduced injunctions against
intermediaries whose services are used by a third party for any proven IPR
infringement, and lays down the minimum legal conditions that must be adhered to by
national courts when formulating injunctive measures. These mechanisms are largely
used across Europe and have proven to be efficient for rightsholders to be able to
enforce their rights, especially with regard to commercial infringements.

At the same time Articles 12 to 15 of the E-Commerce Directive ensure that such
injunctions are proportionate and cannot result in general monitoring obligations. In
the past years the Court of Justice of the European Union has also explicitly dealt with
the possible scope of injunctions against internet intermediaries (e.g. C-324/09 -
L’Oreal/eBay; C-70/10 - Scarlet Extended, C-360/Sabam/Netlog) and made clear that
such injunctions need to be very specific with regard to the measures to be taken by
intermediaries and must not be merely success oriented. For example general filtering
systems installed for the prevention of copyright infringements were considered
disproportionate.




                                            - 10 -
Multi-stakeholder cooperation should not be limited to ISPs cooperating with
rightholders to defend the latter existing business models. Cooperation should also
encompass:

        The widespread availability of legal online content at an affordable price
        Education of consumers

Furthermore, DG Markt is currently working on an Action Plan addressing IPR
infringement.7 The initiative recognises the wide range of intermediaries and aims at
exploring non-legislative initiatives, such as:

        Improving exchange of information and cooperation between relevant
         authorities in charge of enforcement of IPR in the Member States
        Strengthening due diligence across the entire supply chains for
         products/services which depend heavily on intellectual property
        Developing an MoU on advertising/ ‘Follow the money approach’

Finally, this issue should not be limited to ISPs and traditional intermediaries. We also
need to ‘think outside the box’ and ensure, where appropriate, the involvement of e.g.
search engines, means of payment, registrars, DNS services.

Question 77: Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right
balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other
rights such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?

See answer to Question 75 above.
