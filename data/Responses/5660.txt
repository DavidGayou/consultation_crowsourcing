Dear DG Internal Market and Services,

Please google the purpose of copyright. Yes, seriously. I am not pulling your leg. I am not having
you on. I am perfectly serious: Look up the purpose of copyright using your favourite search engine
(and if Google itself bubbles you, try ddg.gg or ixquick.com); again, google the purpose of
copyright and consider very carefully what you read 1 â€“ and ask yourselves: "Is what we've got or
what we're proposing fit for purpose?"

Yours faithfully,
Jens Ropers




1   Because in line with the wishes conveyed by America's K Street, and within Chomskyan set premises of discourse,
    the public debate on copyright among even EU politicians such as yourselves, at least as conveyed in the media, has
    largely been steered in directions which would seem to indicate that the purpose of copyright is not actually known
    to the politicians engaged in this discourse.
