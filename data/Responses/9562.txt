                                                     Auvibel – Central point



Base :

Interim conclusions of the European stakeholders’ platform on copyright levies and its working group
on grey market and export refunds.

“6.4     In order to facilitate the payment of the private copying compensation by distance sellers,
collecting societies will establish a central point to which distance sellers will notify end – consumer
sales into the different Member States and which will transfer to the collecting society of each
Member State the information of the sales made in its territory. Each collecting society will then
calculate the compensation due according to its own national tariff and invoice the concerned
distance seller which will pay directly the amount invoiced to such collecting society. The central point
will also act as an information center about the private copying compensation systems in place in the
E.U. Member states and, for this purpose, each collecting society will regularly provide to such center
the relevant information about its national rules, forms, tariffs and practices.

6.5     The rules governing the establishment and functioning of the central point will be discussed
further between the Parties in the framework of the discussions mentioned in 1.4 here above1.”

Type of collaboration

Structure as light as possible. Best option: mandate given by the collecting societies participating in
an independent legal structure (society to be established).

The mandate (revocable ad nutum) would be given according to the law of each country and its
purpose is the collection of the declarations of the distance sellers (and/or the importers) at the
Central Point, the management of these data in order to transfer them to each national collecting
society, the monitoring of the invoices by each collecting society (clearance of the declarations) and
the management of a central information platform.

It will be necessary for each collecting society to verify if it has the authority to confer such a
mandate (even limited) according to its national law and/or its statutes.

Organization

The collaboration could be structured in a purely contractual arrangement.

It seems however advisable to consider the constitution of a society with a very light structure.

Given the restricted activity of the society, an EEIG or an international association without lucrative
purpose seems the most appropriate form. Each collecting society will be an active member of the
society and may delegate one or two members to the Management Board.

It will be necessary for each collecting society to verify if it has the authority to constitute other
societies or, in the case of a non-profit association or an EEIG, if it can be a member of an association
and possibly participate in the MB of such an association.

Monitoring the declarations / exchange of information

The monitoring of the declarations will be conducted by each collecting society according to its own
law.

The importer shall retain all data required for this purpose and agree to on-site inspections if
necessary.

A delicate issue is the exchange of information. Most of the rights of the Member States consider all
documents exchanged with the collecting society to be confidential and even covered by professional
secrecy (cf. Belgium). This creates a sensitive issue for the CP, which will receive declarations from
various countries (all covered by the duty of confidentiality or professional secrecy). In theory, a
collecting society of a certain country may not receive information relating to another country,
unless an exchange of information between the two is authorized (as in Belgium). In our opinion, it
would be most effective if the CP (which has a European vocation and non-national) centralized only
the information, the declarations and the invoices (issued by each company individually) and that the
parties (especially the importers) confirm that, within these strict constraints, these documents are
not confidential. All other documents (required to verify the authenticity of the transactions) should
transfer solely and directly between the importer and the national collecting society.

Monitoring the activities of the CP

Given the restricted activity of the CP, it does not seem absolutely imperative to conduct public
monitoring of its activities, since invoicing and other operations are still being executed by the
collecting societies according to their own right.

Introducing such monitoring could however contribute to an image of seriousness and
professionalism of the CP.

Management of the expenses of the CP

The expenses of the CP may be charged to the importers (as they have requested it) or to the
collecting societies (since the CP facilitates the collection of the levies).

From a legal point of view it would be difficult if the CP would be able to collect a share of the costs
through a percentage of what was invoiced by the collecting societies, given that the national laws
did not provide him any competence to do so.

It seems more legal to charge the actual costs of the operations of the CP to the collecting societies,
with a partition in accordance with the product volumes declared by each country (a partition in
accordance with the invoicing would be to the detriment of countries with higher levies).
