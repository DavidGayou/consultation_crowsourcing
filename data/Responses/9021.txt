Transparency Register Number: 78964012479-25

Type of respondent:

   ● Institutional user (e.g. school, university, research centre, library, archive) OR
     Representative of institutional users
   ● End user/consumer (e.g. internet user, reader, subscriber to music or audiovisual
     service, researcher, student) OR Representative of end users/consumers for the
     purposes of this questionnaire normally referred to in questions as "end
     users/consumers"

Question 1: [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in
which you live?

There are numerous cases where certain online services that are available in one member
state are not accessible from another member state. Examples of this include Netflix, but
also long established services like Amazon which force their users to pick an account with
one 'local' version of their services effectively preventing users to buy ebooks from the
language specific catalogues of several member states.

These examples are symptomatic of a larger problem, namely that there is no functioning
single market for digital goods. Given that in the digital environment national borders are an
artificial construct citizens have the legitimate expectation that they can access online
services from anywhere in the EU. Also from an innovation and competition perspective
having such fragmentation of online services is undesirable as it makes Europe a less
interesting market for innovators and service providers to focus on.



Question 7: Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border
availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level
of protection for right holders?

We strongly believe that adequate protection for rightholders is not served by fragmenting
markets and making it more difficult for citizens in some member states to gain access to
certain online services that are not being offered in their member states. To the contrary, it
is well established that citizens who do not have legal access to cultural productions (such
as TV series) that are legally available elsewhere have a strong incentive to use
unauthorized sources to obtain the access that they desire. This is detrimental to the
interests of rightholders and by extension undermines the credibility of the copyright system
as a whole.

In addition the current situation violates the essential ideas behind the single European
market. As more and more services go online this will undermine the integration process that
has been achieved in the last decades.

Given all of the above we think that it is necessary that the effects of territoriality should be
limited through legislative measures. In the short term this should include a clarification of
the scope of the making available right (see our answer to the next question) as well as full
harmonisation of limitations and exceptions and other relevant rules. In addition the
European Union should commence working on a single European copyright code to replace
the existing national copyright and related rights legislations and to ensure that the
principles of the single market also apply to online services 1 .

Question 8: Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations –
i.e. when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

No it is not. This can best be illustrated by the case of cultural heritage institutions, which
are increasingly asked to provide access to cultural heritage across the entire EU. In the
majority of cases works made available on the websites of cultural heritage institutions are
made available without territorial restrictions. In this situation there is substantial uncertainty
about the scope of the "making available" right when making works available to audiences
in all of Europe.

Given that cultural heritage institutions have limited resources to spend on rights clearance
the only acceptable way to provide more clarity with regards to the scope of the "making
available" right would be to apply a country of origin principe2 . An approach based on
targeted audiences would create increased burdens since dissemination through platforms
like Europeana is explicitly targeted at users in all member states.

The same argument can be made for all other online service providers. The current
uncertainty does create substantial uncertainties when developing cross border services.
These uncertainties can be reduced by applying a country of origin approach. Applying a
target country approach would also reduce these uncertainties but would mean increased
transaction costs for all types of service providers.

Question 10: Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic
exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

While this situation does not create practical problems (a download is a download) this
situation is indicative of a larger problem. It shows that the current structure of copyright is
increasingly out of sync with technical and social reality. Copyright holders and
intermediaries have traditionally been able to adapt existing rules to new technical realities
but this has created a set of very complex rules and practices that is not understandable to
the majority of citizens/internet users.

While citizens do not necessarily need to have a detailed understanding of the copyright
rules (or the technology) involved in online access to copyrighted works and related services,
it is desirable for a number of reasons to limit unnecessary complexity.

First of all, less complexity means less barriers to market entry which can be expected to
have a positive effect on innovation in the area of online services.

Secondly, and maybe more importantly, a less complex copyright system is easier to
understand for citizens. Understanding a system is one of the prerequisites for creating
legitimacy. As evidenced by questions 75 to 77 of this consultation the Commision is
concerned about the level of respect for rights among European citizens. If the Commission
and other stakeholders (and this includes Kennisland) want to increase the level of respect
for rights then reducing complexity of the system and making it easier to understand is a
necessary first step.

As part of such an effort we support the proposal made by Hargreaves and Hugenholtz to
recalibrate the reproduction right3 :

       Given that the right of making available was especially tailored to serve as the primary
       economic right involved in acts of digital transmission, it would make sense for the
       scope of the right of reproduction to be reduced. This could be achieved by replacing
       the currently technical notion of reproduction by a more normative interpretation that
       factors in the economic impact of a digital reproduction. If a technical copy has no
       economic significance, it should not count as reproduction. Part of this solution could
       be integrating the current exception for transient copying into the definition of the
       reproduction right.

Question 11: Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

No, the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected by
copyright should under no circumstances be subject to the authorization of the rightholder.

Hyperlinking is one of the most fundamental and basic building blocks of the Internet. From
an innovation perspective, users’ ability to freely link to information and to share the URL of
that information has led to an unprecedented amount of online innovation driving economic
growth. If we do not want to limit the potential of the internet anyone should continue to be
able to reference and refer to all publicly available materials via a hyperlinks and all other
technologies that reference the URL such materials.

The creator of a hyperlink must be free to link to publicly available resources without having
to worry about infringing copyright. This needs to be the case regardless of the legal status
of the linked work or of the intent of the rightholder who has published such a work (or
authorized the publication). The recent ruling of the CJEU on the the Svensson case has
unfortunately not provided the required amount of clarity and as a result the European

3
    idem. (page 12)
legislator needs to enact unambiguous rules that ensure that the act of hyperlinking falls
outside the scope of actions protected by copyright. Failing to do so will risk placing
European internet users, businesses and innovators at a competitive disadvantage vis a vis
the rest of the world. It would also be a clear signal that the European legislator does not
understand the important role that open networks play in fields like innovation, access to
culture and freedom of expression.

Question 12: Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the
screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under
specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

No. Digital technologies of all types create temporary copies in order to efficiently deliver
content to a user. Such fleeting reproductions (such as copies in the cache memory) should
be seen as outside the scope of copyright protection. Requiring permission to access
temporary copies would be destructive to the operation of the internet and harmful to the
effective delivery of content and services online.

Asking this very question amounts to asking whether the internet should be legal4 . Requiring
the authorisation of the rightholder for viewing and reading content that is already available
amounts to an additional permission which could lead to citizens infringing the law by merely
surfing on the Internet. This would risk to further reduce the social acceptance op copyright
law. It would also send a signal the Europe does not believe in the potential of open
networks.

II.C Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Question 15: Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?

Yes

Question 16: What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

From our perspective there are a number of advantages: Such a system would increase the
amount of information about rightholders available to all types of users including cultural
heritage institutions. From our work on digitization projects such as Images for the Future5
and with platforms for online access to cultural heritage such as Europeana, we know that
one of the biggest problems facing cultural heritage institutions attempting to make their
collections available online is the lack of comprehensive and easy (read automatically)
access information about the copyright status of works and the identity and location of
rightholders. Introducing a registration system on the European level would be a first step in
ensuring that such information is more readily available in the future.

5
    see: www.imagesforthefuture.org
To be useful such a system needs to record transfers of rights throughout the duration of
the copyright protection of the registered works. In addition a registration system must be
transparent and easy to use, so that it allows all types of rightholders (including individual
creators) to register their works. The system should also include information on works that
are out of copyright as a means to provide legal clarity for users of Public Domain works.

On the more general level      a registration system would decrease transaction costs and
improve the availability of    rights information to all market participants. In particular a
registration system should      be beneficial for rightholders since it makes it easier for
interested parties to obtain   permission for reuse of protected works and to comply with
copyright law.

Note, that a registration system will not be able to retroactively solve the existing problem
with orphan works and mass digitisation (see more about this in reaction to questions 40 and
41).

Question 18: What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

There could be several incentives for rightholders to register their works. Policies could be
enacted whereby certain elements of copyright protection are only available to rightholders
who have registered their works. In principle this could apply to any element of copyright
protection that is not required by the Berne convention.

For example, registration might be required for a rightsholder to start an enforcement action
(such as notice and takedown), or would be required to access a particular type or level of
damage awards in a successful infringement judgment. Another incentive might be that
rightholders need to register their works in order to be eligible to collect royalties through
collective rights management organizations. Finally, registration could be made a
prerequisite for prolonging copyright protection beyond the term the minimum term required
by the Berne convention. (see our answer to question 20 as well).


II.D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
Question 19: What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of
identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and
interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

At the minimum the European Union should ensure two things: (1) that identifiers as well as
rights ownership and permission databases are based on open standards, that they are
available to all content creators and that they can be read by all market participants free of
charge. (2) the EU should also ensure that all identifiers as as well as rights ownership and
permission databases are interoperable work across all of Europe (and beyond).

Any system that is developed must be developed in a true multi-stakeholder approach (e.g.
not only by rightholders and intermediaries). Rights ownership and permission databases in
particular must be publicly accessible on a non-discriminatory basis via machine readable
interfaces. They must also include the ability to store information on out-of-copyright
(Public Domain) and openly licensed works.

II.E Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Question 20: Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
digital environment?

No. The term of copyright protection should be reduced. The excessive length of copyright
protection (including neighbouring rights protection) combined with an absence of formalities
is highly detrimental to the accessibility of our shared knowledge and culture. There is no
evidence that copyright protection that extends decades beyond the life of the author
encourages the production of copyright-protected works. Instead the requirement to obtain
permission for works by authors that have long died, or are not actively exercising their
rights anymore is one of the biggest obstacles for providing access to our shared culture
and knowledge:

Cultural heritage institutions, hold large collections of works that are still under copyright (or
where the copyright status is unclear) but that are not exploited commercially anymore. A
term of protection of life plus 70 years stands in stark contrast with the commercial life of
the large majority of copyright protected works in their collections that is much shorter. As a
result the disproportionate length of copyright protection prevents our institutions from
effectively fulfilling our mission in the digital environment.

In many cases the cost for digitisation of copyrighted works that are no longer in
commercial exploitation exceeds by far the potential economic value of these works6 . As a
result these are not made available online by the rightholders who lack an economic
incentive. While cultural heritage institutions that have such works in their collections have an
incentive to make such works available (it is their public task to provide access to their
collections) they are confronted with costs for rights clearance that increase the costs for
making these collections available (without generating economic benefit for rightholders).

One of the outcomes of this is the existence of the so called ‘20th century black hole’ when
it comes to online availability of copyrighted works. Works from the 20th century are
significantly less likely to be available than works from the centuries before (many of which
are clearly in the public domain) or from the 21st century (many of which are still available
commercially).

Shortening the term of protection will decrease the number of out-of-commerce works that
are in copyright and will thus reduce the scope of the problems outlined above. Given this
the term of copyright protection should be reduced to at least the minimum requirement
established by the Berne Convention (life of the creator plus 50 years).

In addition the European Union should work in the relevant international fora to further
reduce the term. This should include efforts to agree on a system where extended

http://ssrn.com/abstract=2290181 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2290181
copyright protection after an initial automatically granted term would be only granted if the
work is registered by the rightholder. The duration of the initial term should be brought into
line with the duration of protection of other IP rights such as patented inventions (20 years)
databases (15 years) and industrial design rights (25 years)7 . Given this, 20 years appears to
be a reasonable initial term of protection that should guarantee protection to the vast
majority of protected works. Rightholders should have the ability to extend the term of
protection for works that they intend to exploit after the end of the initial period by
registering such works.

III.Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Question 21: Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member
States?

Yes, the optional nature of the list of exceptions and limitations has resulted in a patchwork
of approaches across the EU, creating confusion and legal uncertainty for users and an
uneven playing field for organisations. Users of the same type should be able to enjoy the
same exceptions (user rights) in all member states.

The current situation make copyright law more difficult to understand to users and makes
copyright policies more difficult to implement for service providers and other intermediaries.
In line with our answer to question 10 we think that it is in the systems best interest to
reduce unnecessary complexities. The most comprehensive way to address this issue
would be to establish a unified EU copyright title (compare our answer to question 78).

Question 22: Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

Yes, all existing and additional exceptions should be made mandatory and harmonised to
the fullest extent possible (obviously after they have been broadened in line with our
response to the relevant questions below). It is not acceptable that citizens in some
members state enjoy lesser level of access to works protected by copyright simply
because of an uneven implementation of exceptions and limitations of the InfoSoc directive.

All the exceptions provided by the EU copyright directives are drafted on the basis that they
do not interfere with the normal exploitation of the work and, therefore, do not unreasonably
prejudice rightholders. This means that making them mandatory in all member states should
have no negative effect on rightholders, while in many cases this will substantially benefit
citizens and other public policy objectives such as access to knowledge and culture or
inclusive education.

Question 23: Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed
from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

  See also Hargreaves and Hugenholtz: Copyright Reform for Growth and Jobs - Modernising the European
Copyright       Framework         (pages       8-9),      Brussels       29/05/2013.       Available     at:
http://www.lisboncouncil.net/publication/publication/95-copyright-reform-for-growth-and-jobs-modernising-the
-european-copyright-framework.html
Yes, new exceptions should be added that allow non-commercial sharing for protected
works by individuals (see our answer to question 61), as well as text and data mining (see our
answer to question 55).

Also, the status of e-lending should be clarified (see the answers to questions 37) possibly
via a new exception. In addition cultural heritage institutions need to be enabled to make
works in their collections available online for non-commercial purposes. As outlined in the
answer to question 34 this does not require a new exception but can be achieved by
expanding the scope of the existing provision in article 5(3)n of the directive.

Finally there is a need to introduce an open ended norm that increases the flexibility of the
current system of targeted exceptions (see next question).

Question 24: Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and
exceptions?

Yes, there is a need for more flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and
exceptions8 . The exceptions and limitations in the 2001 InfoSoc directive were not drafted in
a technologically neutral manner which is problematic in times of accelerated technological
progress.

By definition exception and limitations that apply to specific uses cannot ensure that as of
yet unknown forms of use are covered by them. Technological innovation can be expected
to lead to new forms of use in the near future and Europe would be well advised to create a
copyright framework that is flexible enough to deal with such developments. The current
discussion about text and data mining is a good example of this:

European researchers have to deal with legal uncertainties about the status of text and
data mining activities because the InfoSoc directive fails to address this form of use that
was (relatively) unknown when it was adopted. Having an open norm would have provided
the structure for creating more certainty on the legal aspects of text and data mining at the
time when the issue started to arise.

As pointed out by Professors Hugenholtz and Senftleben, a flexible approach is not only
beneficial but is also in line with the historical development of copyright rules in the EU:9

      There appear to be good reasons and ample opportunity to (re)introduce a measure of
      flexibility in the national copyright systems of Europe. The need for having more
      openness in copyright law is almost self-evident in this ‘information society’ of highly
      dynamic and unpredictable change. A historic perspective also suggests that, due to a
      variety of circumstances, copyright law, particularly in the civil law jurisdictions of
      Europe, has lost much of its flexibility in the course of the past century. In other words,

     making copyright law in author’s rights regimes more flexible would not go against the
     grain of legal tradition. (...) We would therefore recommend to introduce a measure of
     flexibility alongside the existing structure of well-defined limitations and exceptions, and
     thus combine the advantages of legal security and technological neutrality.

From an economic perspective, the current EU copyright regime puts Europe at a
competitive disadvantage with the rest of the world, as knowledge intensive economies
such as the US, South Korea, Taiwan and Israel benefit from the flexibility offered by their
‘Fair-Use’ style exceptions.

Question 25: If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives,
interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or
fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the
relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible
effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

The best approach would be one that provides built in flexibility in reaction to new
technological developments or new forms of use. An open norm such as fair use fits this
description. It should be implemented EU-wide (see also answer to Question 22) and in
addition to (existing) targeted exceptions and limitations (as an additional exception). As
long as an open norm is implemented EU wide its effect on the functioning of the single
market would be minimal while it can be expected to improve the competitive position of
European market actors vis a vis market participants in other jurisdictions that have an open
norm.

III.A.1 Access to content in libraries and archives
Question 28: (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific
works or other subject matter in your collection?

With regards to all questions in this section it should be stressed that while the consultation
document limits itself to activities of libraries and archives the questions in this section are
equally relevant for museums and other cultural heritage institutions. In fact the relevant
exceptions and limitations explicitly apply to ‘publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments or museums, or […] archives’. The 2012 Orphan Works directive clarifies this
to include 'film or audio heritage institutions and public-service broadcasting organisations'.
In line with this, the following answers (28-35 and 39-41) should be read as applying to all
cultural heritage institutions falling within this scope and not only to libraries and archives.
Our answers to the questions in this section are largely identical to the answers contained in
the response of the working group of Dutch Cultural Heritage Institutions, which we have
signed as well.

The Netherlands have implemented article 5(2)c of the InfoSoc directive as an exception in
its national copyright law (article 16n). This exception formulates three specific acts of
reproduction: restoration, preservation of material that threatens to decay and format
shifting if formats become inaccessible. These narrowly defined, specific acts of
reproduction, do not fully cover the needs of cultural heritage institutions in the digital
environment.

Institutions increasingly digitize works in their collections not only to prevent harm, but to be
able to better fulfil their missions. Digital copies of cultural heritage works provide many
advantages such as being (automatically) indexable, being easier to access and having
lower storage costs. The current Dutch implementation of article 5(2)c of the InfoSoc
directive does not allow institutions to structurally create digital copies of works in their
collection. This prevents institutions from fully realising the potential inherent to digitisation
of their collections. This is highly detrimental in an environment where, as the 'New
Renaissance' report10 puts it, “digitization is more than a technical option, it is a moral
obligation”.

In addition recital 40 of the directive which states that 'Such an exception or limitation
should not cover uses made in the context of online delivery of protected works or other
subject-matter' is highly problematic. As online dissemination of works becomes more and
more important for cultural heritage institutions, limiting the reproduction exception in such a
way is simply anachronistic as it prevents institutions from using digitized works in a
meaningful way.

Also technological measures and their relationship with the exceptions benefitting cultural
heritage institutions are highly problematic: Often CDs and DVDs are protected by
technological measures, the removal of which would require the cooperation of the
producer. Art. 6 of the Infosoc Directive provides that technological protection measures are
protected per se, independently on the scope of protection, entrusting to voluntary
agreements or to subsidiary interventions of Member States the adoption of appropriate
measures to ensure that legitimate users can make effective use of licensed content.



Question 29: If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

From our perspective the best solution would be to broaden the existing exception in article
5(2)c of the InfoSoc directive, so that it allows institutions to make reproductions of all works
in their collection as long as these are not intended for direct commercial advantage. In line
with our answer to Question 22 this exception should be made mandatory for all member
states.

Also Art. 6 of the InfoSoc directive should be revised in order to enforce exceptions and
limitations and to ensure legitimate utilizations of protected works, regardless of format or
mode of dissemination.

Question 30: If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its
main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered
and under which conditions?

10
   COMITÉ DES SAGES, The New Renaissance, Report of the Reflection group on bringing Europe’s cultural
heritage online, 2011, http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/doc/refgroup/
final_report_cds.pdf, p. 14
The main element would be a broadening of the existing exception in article 5(2)c of the
InfoSoc directive. Instead of only allowing specific acts of reproductions it should allow all
acts of reproduction necessary for publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments
or museums, or by archives to achieve aims related to their public-interest missions. This
should include reproductions made as part of mass digitization efforts, backup copies and
reproductions for format shifting.

Reproductions should be limited to use by the heritage institution itself which is not for
direct commercial or economic advantage or use in line with other exceptions and limitations
allowed for by the directive (such as the broadened version of the exception foreseen in
article 5(3)n that we propose in answer to question 34). Reproductions would explicitly be
allowed for the purposes of increasing the operational efficiency and reducing costs of the
beneficiary institutions.

Broadening the scope of the extension along these lines mirrors the recommendations
made as part of the European Commission commissioned 'Study on the application of
directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in the information society' from
december 201311 .

III.A.2 Off­premises access to library collections
Question 32: (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rightholders that
enable you to provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections
(or parts thereof) for purposes of research and private study?

Libraries are subject to complex and lengthy negotiations with publishers and database
vendors, which impact upon collection development, duration of access, permitted uses.
Negotiation with publishers is an expensive and time consuming process and most licences
are presented as final, without the ability to negotiate on terms, which are often taken over
from other jurisdictions.

Often libraries entrust negotiation and management of contracts to national or regional
institutional consortia to increase their bargaining power. But the use of consortia for the
negotiations is a remedy, not an optimal solution, and the logic of large numbers may
introduce rigidities in pricing and business models, encouraging the purchase or subscription
of large packages of content rather than the selection of targeted works. Also it is
extremely common for licences to prevent cross border access to digital content for
research and study.

In more general terms this question fails to address the most urgent issue confronting
cultural heritage institutions today: providing online access to works in their collection.
Among the existing exceptions the exception for the consultation of works and other
11
   Compare De Wolff and Partners: Study on the application of Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related
rights    in  the    information   society    (pages   291-302),   Brussels  16/12/2013.   Available at:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/131216_study_en.pdf
subject-matter via dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the
purpose of research and private study comes closest to a mechanism that could enable
such uses.

From both the perspective of publicly available libraries, archives and museums as well as
the perspective of our patrons (end users/consumers) the existing exception that allows
institutions to make works in their collections available ‘for the purpose of research or
private study, to individual members of the public by dedicated terminals on the premises’
(article 5(3)n) is extremely limited and not in line with the technological possibilities and the
expectations of citizens anymore.

Limiting the availability of digitised works to dedicated terminals on the premises of cultural
heritage institutions prevents them from reaching citizens that cannot travel to the
premises (for example because they are disabled or because they lack the economic
means to do so). Furthermore it is out of line with the legitimate expectation of users that
have been shaped by universal online accessibility of other services. Citizens, researchers
and educators would greatly benefit from online access to the collections of Europe's
publicly funded institutions.

For our institutions to fully participate in the digital public space we must be enabled to offer
online services that are available from everywhere and by anyone seeking to ‘to participate
in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement
and its benefits’, as enshrined by article 27.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Online universal access to the collections of all publicly accessible libraries, Museums and
Archives can play an important role in realising this objective. Being able to offer online
access to works in our collections will also allow our institutions to reach bigger and more
diverse audiences. For these reasons we consider the current exception to be too narrow.

Question 33: If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

From our perspective, the best solution would be to broaden the existing exception in article
5(3)n of the InfoSoc directive, so that it allows institutions to make available digital copies of
out-of-commerce works in their collections via electronic networks such as the internet for
non commercial purposes.

Question 34: If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its
main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered
and under which conditions?

The main element would be a broadening of the existing exception in article 5(3)n of the
InfoSoc directive. Instead of limiting the making available to dedicated terminals on the
premises of the institutions it should also apply to making the works available online via
public networks such as the internet. The scope of the exception should further be
expanded to not only include ‘the purpose of research or private study’ by ‘individual
members of the public’ but should apply to all non commercial uses.

Furthermore, It seems reasonable to limit the scope of the exception to ‘works and other
subject-matter not subject to purchase or licensing terms’ as long as they are still
commercially available. This should be combined with an opt out-clause that would allow
rightholders to either prevent the making available of their works or to negotiate licensing
terms with the institutions (either on an individual basis or collectively).

These conditions are crucial to ensure that the new broadened exception meets the
requirements of the three step test. Limiting the scope of the exception to publicly
accessible cultural heritage institutions and to out-of-commerce works and works that are
not subject to licensing terms should satisfy the 'certain special cases' criterium and
cannot, by definition, be in conflict with the 'normal exploitation' of the works in question.
The fact that the exception would be limited to non commercial uses of the works made
available and that authors can decide to opt-out of the exception would further ensure that
'the legitimate interests of the author' are not necessarily prejudiced.

In fact many authors would benefit from improving online access to out-of-commerce works
because works that they have created are kept available via cultural heritage institutions
(and are available to them to build upon or to do research). As a result citizens, researchers
and educators also greatly benefit, because they are granted access to works that
wouldn't be available through markets players.

This solution would also be in line with the relevant recommendations made in the 'New
Renaissance' report. The report recommended that 'National governments and the
European Commission should promote solutions for the digitisation of and cross-border
access to out of distribution works' and that 'For cultural institutions collective licensing
solutions and a window of opportunity should be backed by legislation, to digitise and bring
out of distribution works online, if rightholders and commercial providers do not do so'12 .

III.A.3 E – lending
Question 36: (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending
(e-lending), including across borders, of books or other materials held in your
collection?

Libraries have faced a number of problems when attempting to negotiate agreements to
facilitate electronic lending. These include:

     ● Denial of sales of electronic books to libraries by publishers;
     ● Removal of content that was available for e-lending without informing the library;
     ● The use of multiple licences and different models create lack of clarity on the
       condition of access to the content for users;
     ● A deterioration of registered users’ rights (crossing a border with a borrowed book
       was not a problem. Transborder online access to an electronic copy offered by a
       library is often impossible as the result of restrictive licensing conditions.

12
   COMITÉ DES SAGES, The New Renaissance, Report of the Reflection group on bringing Europe’s cultural
heritage online, 2011, http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/doc/refgroup/
final_report_cds.pdf, p. 5
More generally the question is if it is necessary and desirable to negotiate agreements to
enable electronic lending. Contrary to what is stated in the introduction to this question
there is considerable uncertainty about the status of e-lending under EU law. The directive
on rental and lending does not explicitly excludes e-lending or lending of digital items from
its scope and some libraries argue that based on the current acquis and the UsedSoft
decision by the ECJ they should be allowed to provide e-books in libraries for download. In
the Netherlands the Association of Public Libraries (Vereniging van Openbare Bibliotheken)
has brought the matter before the courts. They have started a test case against the
collective management organisation in charge of the lending right arguing that they should
be allowed to provide e-books in libraries for download.

Question 37: If there are problems, how would they best be solved

The best solution for the problem would be to create legal certainty by unambiguously
including the right to e-lending in the EU aquis. While the lending of analogue works is
currently being enabled by directive 2006/115 e-lending, which is most often considered as
an act of making available, would probably need to be regulated via an (additional)
mandatory exception in the InfoSoc directive. Such a new exception could take the form of
a statutory license with fair compensation for authors.

Since e-lending must be available for all books (commercially available or not) it should be
treated separately from the general exception for making out-of-commerce works available
online that we argue for in response to question 34.

Question 38: [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you
see in the management of physical and online collections, including providing access
to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?

From the perspective of cultural heritage institutions there are enormous differences
between physical and online collections. These differences are so fundamental that it does
not makes sense to compare the two. The ability to offer access to their collections online
frees cultural heritage institutions from many of the constraints imposed by them by the
properties of analogue media and their physical infrastructure (such as buildings). Being able
to offer access to collections online means that in theory access can be provided to full
collections independent from the location of the viewer or the time of the day. This has the
potential to radically improve the ability of publicly funded cultural heritage institutions to
carry out their public mission to provide access to knowledge and culture.

Unfortunately this enormous potential is currently being held back by copyright rules
unnecessarily restrict how cultural heritage institutions can exercise their mission in the
online environment. Under the current EU copyright rules cultural heritage institutions are
dependent on permission from rightholders in order to make protected works in their
collection available online. As we have argued above this makes no sense in situations
where the majority of works held by these institutions are not even commercially available.

With the increasing digitisation of our society and media production in particular this has
other, potentially far reaching consequences. Libraries for example can buy all physical
publications to ensure that they are available to the public both during the period of their
commercial availability and thereafter.

The same is not true for digital publications that are not being sold, but licensed: Currently
Libraries cannot buy licences to all commercially available content because rightholders are
free to decide whether they want to give access to a specific work, and to decide on the
terms for such access. Often such conditions make it impossible to keep such works
indefinitely or to make it available to the community by lending it out.

The consequence of this is that the collection building policy of Libraries is increasingly
determined by the publishers and not by the institutions. In the long run this development
threatens to undermine the core function of cultural heritage institutions to preserve the
knowledge and culture of our societies and to keep it available to the public.

With regards to the above the 'study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC on copyright
and related rights in the information society' that was commissioned by the European
Commission and published in december 201313 contains an interesting observation. At the
end of the section discussing inter alia the exception benefitting cultural heritage
institutions, the authors observe that:

      "The large-scale digitization projects ultimately aim at the making available of the
      collection, [...] the making available for consultation is increasingly requested to apply
      at distance and online; and the lending is shifting to cover the online transmission of
      digital items. The exception-by-exception reasoning, which is the model of the InfoSoc
      Directive, might not be relevant anymore. Maybe it is time to look at different uses that
      some categories of users (libraries or educational institutions) or some objectives
      (access to culture and knowledge or education) would be privileged to undertake under
      a limitation of copyright. [...] the space of non-infringing uses could be defined by their
      objective and some general conditions, including a more open requirement that the
      use does not exceed what is necessary for its objective. This is a radical move that this
      study has not made. It could make our system of exceptions more fit for its purpose
      and understandable for users and copyright owners alike. If the requirements for each
      exception are adequate and legitimate, it would not sacrifice the high level of
      protection of copyright and related rights that the EU law has adopted."

From the perspective of (Dutch) cultural heritage institutions such an approach would have
many benefits. It would create room for rethinking Europe's rich tradition of providing access
to knowledge and culture through public institutions and it would enable our institutions to
fully leverage the possibilities offered by digitization and near universal connectivity.


III.A.4 Mass digitisation


13
   Compare De Wolff and Partners: Study on the application of Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related
rights    in    the    information    society   (page     403),  Brussels   16/12/2013.   Available     at:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/131216_study_en.pdf
Question 40: [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to
engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management
organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure
that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries
and collecting societies) have a cross- border effect so that out of commerce works
can be accessed across the EU?

From the perspective of cultural heritage institutions this question (and the following) are too
limited. The issue of mass digitization is far broader than what can be addressed with the
2011 MoU and the 2012 Orphan works directive (the other relevant European policy
instrument in this area). Copyright issues related to the mass digitization of collections and
the subsequent making available of digitized works require a comprehensive approach that
cannot be based the principles of due diligence search and licensing. If we want to enable
European cultural heritage institutions to transfer their collections into the digital age (and
there cannot be any doubt that this is both an important policy objective and a reasonable
expectation of users who as taxpayers fund these organisations) we need a far more
comprehensive approach.

Both the 2012 directive on certain permitted uses of orphan works and the 2011 MoU on out
of commerce works are insufficient to address the copyright issues arising from mass
digitisation projects. In addition, the extremely slow uptake of the MoU (according to the
2013 the 'study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in
the information society' there is one single project that is "inspired" by the MoU14 ) clearly
illustrates that the MoU is not a suitable mechanism for enabling mass digitization on a large
scale.

The Orphan Works Directive is ill-suited to enable mass digitisation projects. While it will
enable publicly accessible libraries, museums and archives to make orphan works available
after a due diligence search has been carried out for specific works, the requirement of
carrying out due diligence search makes it effectively unusable for mass digitisation
projects as this would require an huge additional investments in both time and money.

The inadequacies of both the OW directive as well as the Memorandum of Understanding
can be addressed by an extension of the scope of the exception created by article 5(3)n of
the InfoSoc directive as outlined in the answer to question 34 above. Doing this would
provide cultural heritage institutions a clear legal framework for operating in the digital
environment that would allow us to to achieve the aims related to our public-interest
missions. Under this approach the online activities of cultural heritage institutions would be
covered by three targeted exceptions:

      ● An exception covering the making of reproductions (an expanded version of the
        current exception defined in 5(2)c)
      ● An exception covering the making available online of out-of-commerce works (an
        expanded version of the current exception defined in 5(3)n)
      ● A new exception covering e-lending


14
     idem. (page 279)
Question 41: Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already
agreed for other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections,
broadcasters’ archives)?

This is certainly necessary. The public has a legitimate interest in having online access to
the collections of all publicly accessible libraries, museums and archives across Europe (see
article 27.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights). There is no good reason for
limiting mechanisms that create such access to certain types of content. The approach
proposed in reaction to questions 40 and 34 above, would cover all types of works and other
subject matter that are held by these institutions.

This solution would also be in line with the relevant recommendation made in the 'New
Renaissance' report of the Commission appointed 'Comite de Sages' that was published in
2011. The report recommended that 'solutions for orphan works and out of distribution
works must cover all the different sectors: audiovisual, text, visual arts, sound'15 .


III.B Teaching
Question 42: (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have
you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other
subject-matter for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

Yes. As noted by the European Commission in the introductory message above, the
educational exception in the directive is already broad and should be interpreted as allowing
for the inclusion of all types of works for illustration of teaching.

It is however problematic that none of the Member States have implemented the exception
as broadly as allowed by the Copyright Directive and that the permitted uses in educational
contexts differ between member states. This presents special difficulties for the providers
of online open courses that can be accessed by citizens in different member states.

Also the exceptions implemented in many member states are unfit for the digital age as
they are often limited to uses made in educational establishments or by accredited
students. Such conditions limit the usefulness of these exceptions for online educational
resources that are freely available. As they are often interpreted that any use of
copyrighted material beyond the physical premises of such establishments requires prior
authorisation from rightholders.

Question 43: If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

The problems would best be solved by making the educational exception mandatory for all
the member states while clearly defining its specific provisions leaving no room for narrow
implementations, as recommended in Question 45 below.


15
    COMITÉ DES SAGES, The New Renaissance, Report of the Reflection group on bringing Europe’s cultural
heritage online, 2011, http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/doc/refgroup/
final_report_cds.pdf, p. 5
In addition, the educational sector provides another example of the need for simple, easy to
understand copyright rules (compare our answer to question 10 above). While educational
uses are covered by targeted exceptions in all member states, it is our repeated
experience that both education professionals and students struggle with determining what
types of use they can make without obtaining prior permission from rightholders.

These experiences are mirrored by the Hargreaves report16 , which observes:

      Many university academics – along with teachers elsewhere in the education sector –
      are uncertain what copyright permits for themselves and their students. Administrators
      spend substantial sums of public money to entitle academics and research students to
      access works which have often been produced at public expense by academics and
      research students in the first place. (…) Senior figures and institutions in the university
      sector have told the Review of the urgent need reform copyright to realise
      opportunities, and to make it clear what researchers and educators are allowed to do.

Question 45: If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its
main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered
and under what conditions?

A legislative solution on the EU level is needed, perhaps in the form of a regulation rather
than a Directive. Any process should be conducted carefully so as not to lose or alter the
currently broad and open educational exception.

The mandatory educational exception should cover all uses of all types of works for
illustration of teaching. It should not be limited to any types of institution, but rather defined
by its purpose: teaching. All types of educational establishments are deemed to be included
under the exception’s scope regardless of their source of financing: public or private as long
as the purpose of educational activity is primarily non-commercial.

The exception should allow for use of any copyrighted material, including text, film,
multimedia for illustration of teaching in classrooms as well as in distance learning. It should
also allow for using copyrighted works in teaching compilations, whether they be analogue or
digital.

The no license and no compensation model is recommended, meaning that the uses for
illustration of teaching should not require the consent (license) or remuneration to
rightholders. However, fair compensation may be needed in order to satisfy the three-step
test, especially where the exempted uses concern works made available for e-learning
purposes, for example in massive open online courses. It is our view that the levies should
be paid by the educational institution (running a course or engaged in organization of a
course) located in the country where the uploading of the educational materials takes place.

Fair distribution of the sums collected should be assured.


III.D Disabilities
Question 50: (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation
representing persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with
accessibility to content, including across borders, arising from Member States’
implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published
in special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?

At present, persons with disabilities – in particular the visually impaired, deaf , dyslexic and
other print disabled persons – in the EU and globally, only have access to a very small
fraction of the reading material published each year.

This situation is especially limited with regards to the cross border shipment or exchange of
accessible formats for persons with disabilities given that Member States and International
law up until now does not allow the legal cross border exchange of reading content among
institutions and organisations that serve the cultural and academic needs of persons with
disabilities.

The ratification and effective implementation by the EU and its Member States of the World
Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Marrakech Treaty17 could overcome much of this
problem for visually impaired persons, but these exceptions and limitations to copyright
should also be extended to person with other disabilities.



Question 51: If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

The swift ratification, implementation and application of the WIPO Marrakech Treaty by the
EU and its Member States is needed to improve accessibility for persons with disabilities. A
broader interpretation of EU exceptions applied to other disabilities should also be included
in EU and national legislations.

Question 52: What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to
content? How successful are they?

There are not enough mechanisms in place at present. To a great extent there has been a
17
  WIPO. (2013). Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually
Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled, adopted by the Diplomatic Conference to Conclude a Treaty to
Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities in
Marrakesh, on June 27, 2013. Available at, http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/text.jsp?file_id=301016.
market failure to supply accessible formats for persons with disabilities. Despite the great
technical advancements in the digital space, most persons with disabilities cannot take
advantage of these possibilities due to the lack of availability of protected works in suitable
formats.

III.E Text and data mining
Question 53: (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have
you experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data
mining methods, including across borders?

Yes, since in most cases it is necessary to make a copy of the content in order for a
machine to extract facts and data for mining, the act of text and data mining there is a lot
of uncertainty among users of online services provided by cultural heritage institutions that
want to make use of text and data mining. Because it restricts the copying of large portions
of databases, the Database Directive may also a legal barrier to text and data mining.
Although text and data mining is concerned with the extraction of facts and data and as
such should not be subject to an exclusive right, the results of text and data mining research
are currently being suppressed because of a lack of legal clarity.

We observe that the resulting legal uncertainties create a situation where the wealth
information that is available online (often produced and made available by publicly funded
institutions) is not fully accessible to researchers employing text and data mining
technologies.


Question 54: If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

From our perspective, the best solution would be an additional mandatory exception that is
added to the list of targeted exceptions contained in the InfoSoc directive.

Question 55: If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its
main elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?


A  legislative  solution should  take  the  form  of  an  exception  which  allows  the  copying of content and
the  circumvention  of  TPMs  for text  and  data  mining  purposes.  Researchers  must be able to share
the  results  of   text  and  data  mining,  as  long  as  these  results  are  not  substitutable  for  the  original
copyright  work  ­  irrespective  of  copyright law,  database  law  or  contractual  terms  to the contrary. A
specific  exception  to  this  effect  allowing  the  copying   of  content  for  the  purpose  of  text  and   data
mining  is  necessary.  Such  an  exception  should  not  distinguish  between  commercial  and
non­commercial purposes as, for research institutions, this would prevent knowledge transfer.


III.F User­generated content

Question 58: (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced
problems when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to
disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when
users publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other
subject-matter through your service, including across borders?

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to
disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?

Current EU legislation does not structurally allow citizens to share remixes and mashups of
pre-existing works online, even in non-commercial contexts and when only very minor parts
of works are re-used. This stands in stark contrast with everyday practices of large parts of
the population. The fact that european citizens are able to express themselves via
transformative uses of protected material is not due to exceptions guaranteeing this
fundamental rights but to an opaque mix of licensing arrangements (concluded by platform
providers with rightholders) and selective enforcement of rights.

From our perspective this situation is highly undesirable. As long as they do so without a
commercial motivation, citizens should have the right to express themselves in any media
and to make transformative uses of protected materials in doing so. Citizens should not
only be allowed to make private copies of material that they have access to but they should
also have the right to share protected works for non-commercial purposes.

Question 62: If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?

From our perspective a (mandatory) exception that allows non-commercial sharing (making
of reproductions and making available) of protected works by individuals would provide
sufficient room for citizens to express themselves. Such an exception could either be a new
one or an extension of the scope of an existing one such as the exception for the benefit of
quotations (as foreseen in article 5(3)d of the InfoSoc directive). In the Netherlands the latter
approach has recently been proposed by the Copyright advisory board18 .

V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

Question 72: [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism
(or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate
remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?

While this consultation is about copyright and not about developing legislation-based
business models for the authors and performers, we believe that the position of authors
and performers can be improved by strengthening their rights vis a vis publishers and other
distributors of their work. Authors and performers should have the ability to regain control of

18
     See: Commissie Auteursrecht, Een flexibele regeling voor user-generated content, 2012,
http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2012/10/30/advies-een-flexibele-regeling-vo
or-user-generated-content.html
works that they have assigned to third parties if those third parties do not actively exploit
their works (anymore). Such a non-uses clause can for example be found in the changes to
the Dutch copyright act that is currently pending in Dutch parliament.

Also authors of scientific articles and other short works (such as contributions to proceeding
of academic proceedings should have the (time delayed) right to publish such works in an
open access publication that cannot be waived or transferred to another party such as a
Scientific publisher. Such clauses aimed at ensuring public access to publicly funded
academic research can be found in the German copyright law and in the proposed revisions
to the Dutch copyright act that is currently pending in Dutch parliament.

Question 73 - Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain
clauses in contracts)?

Given that the European Union is currently promoting open access to publicly funded
research as part of the Horizon2020 program it seems reasonable to create the legal
conditions that ensure that authors of academic works can fulfill their open access
obligations even when they also work with scientific publishers. In addition and in line with our
previous answers we believe that any other measure to improve the standing of authors
and performers vis a vis publishers and other other distributors can best be strengthened at
the EU level.

Question 74: If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you
suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

See our answer to question 73

VI. Respect for rights

Question 75: Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more
efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

No, Respect for rights is not created by enforcement, but by establishing rules that are
perceived as fair and balanced by as many people as possible. The most effective way to
improve respect for rights would be to take user concerns seriously when addressing the
other issues identified throughout our answers to the entire consultation. Copyright holders
have ample means to enforce their rights. At the same time social acceptance of copyright
rules remains low and citizens obtain content from unauthorized sources.

Any system that seeks to improve respect for the rules that it establishes needs to ensure
that the rules are well balanced and perceived as fair by all stakeholders (or at least a
majority of the stakeholders directly affected by these rules). The recent explosion of
digital technologies has meant that citizens and professionals that were previously situated
outside of the reach of the copyright system are now affected by the system in their day to
day actions and professional activities. As we have outlined in our answers to the questions
III we do not believe that the legitimate interests of citizens and many professionals are
adequately expressed by the existing copyright laws. This perception of copyright as a
system that imposes unjust limits on citizens and professionals, combined with the fact that
the current systems is overly complex, undermines acceptance of the system.

In our answers to the questions above we have proposed a number of modifications to the
system that have the potential to, once implemented, increase the social acceptance of
the system as a whole. Without these much needed changes the system risks to alienate
even larger groups of stakeholders which will even further undermine respect for the rights
of creators.



Question 76: In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for
sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers,
advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in
inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what
measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

The limitation of intermediaries’ liability is important and is a cornerstone of the functioning
of the Internet. Without it, there is a high risk of censorship and of going against freedom of
expression, freedom of communication but also freedom to conduct a business. Middlemen
should not be made liable and privatised enforcement is not the solution.

Question 77: Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right
balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other
rights such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?

No, the current civil enforcement framework is tilted towards the interests of rightholders.
As mentioned above there is a need for more balanced copyrights rules that can easily be
understood (and followed) by all stakeholders. As long as this is not the case a renewed
focus on enforcement measures will only further undermine the social acceptance of the
system as a whole.



VII. A single EU Copyright Title
Question 78: Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to
copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

Yes, in line with our previous answers (see questions 10, 21 and 22) any instrument that
would provide more coherence into the EU copyright system would be very welcome. A
single EU copyright title is necessary in order to achieve a fully functioning single digital
market and should - if well executed - be easier to understand for citizens and professionals
alike.

Question 79: Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU?
Does the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that
this is a longer term project?

This should be the next step and should be undertaken as soon as possible.

VIII. Other issues
Question 80: Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal
framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be
addressed.

In our answers to the questions above we have repeatedly touched on the issue of
protected works that have been produced or otherwise created by public institutions and/or
with public funds. Kennisland strongly believes that works and other subject matter that are
produced by public bodies or with public funds should be available for reuse by citizens,
entrepreneurs, researchers and and businesses. Given this we think that Europe should
develop a strong open access policies for these sectors.

The recently adopted update of the PSI directive is a good start but we think that there are
important areas that are not covered. These include the educational sector but also public
broadcasting organisations who should be encouraged to make more of their output
available under licensing conditions that allow others to build upon the creations of this
sector.
