            (answer	to	questions	47	–	49)
Preliminary note
Verband der Chemischen Industrie e. V. (VCI, the German chemical industry
association) represents the political-economic interests of some 1,650 German
chemical companies and German subsidiaries of foreign businesses. The VCI
stands for over 90 percent of the chemical industry in Germany. In 2012 the
German chemical industry realised sales of some 186 billion euros and
employed over 434,000 staff.
VCI is listed in the EU-Transparency-Register (Organisation-ID-Number
Transparency Register: 15423437054-40).


VCI-Comments
As a research and innovation-driven industry, the chemical industry depends in a very
special way on easy access to and the archiving of electronic reproductions of
publications. Most notably, in efforts to realise its research and development projects
the chemical industry relies on scientific literature. Scientific publications in specialist
periodicals have a major role when gathering information for research purposes.
Furthermore, access is needed to information about new markets, the needs of
customers, and technological and societal trends generally – to make sure that there is
a demand for newly developed products and services in the relevant markets. Against
this backdrop, also publications from these fields are greatly important to the
companies.
Consequently: easy, fast and favourably priced access to reproductions of scientific
literature, the possibility to centrally store (archive) such reproductions and to structure
them (e.g. by means of indexing) – in order to enable repeated access to their
contents – are essential for companies who want to make their research and develop-
ment plans a reality.
This holds also true with the ever rising volumes of information so that the analogue
information management of only recent years is practically no longer possible today.
Moreover, numerous pieces of national and European legislation oblige the chemical
industry to keep available and, where necessary, submit to the competent authorities
certain items of literature: within registration and authorisation procedures and product
monitoring or in case of emission incidents. Here some examples of such obligations:




  29. Januar 2014                                                                         1
   Requirement to provide information on (eco-)toxicity in emission incidents;
   submission of information under the REACH Regulation. The items of information
   required by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) can include scientific
   documents, e.g. comprehensive study reports in the form of essays in periodicals
   etc;
   obligation to provide proof regarding literature quotes used when answering
   enquiries from competent authorities, as regards chemicals assessments/ dossiers;
   legal provisions requiring literature data for the assessment of (eco-)toxicological
   endpoints (e.g. REACH, German animal protection act/TierschutzG);
   requirement to understandably document the classification of substances/ products
   under REACH;
   notification requirement in cases of suspected severe adverse drug reactions with
   an evaluation of topical literature under the German medicinal products act (AMG);
   obligation to provide proof on scientific findings in the medicines authorisation
   procedure under the German medicinal products act (AMG).


Also worth mentioning is the patent application procedure where the companies must
provide proof on the state-of-the-art by means of scientific publications. If they fail to
fulfil this requirement, they run the risk of their patent applications being rejected. Such
losses of rights can negatively impact the competitiveness of companies.
Furthermore, the companies need to keep available comprehensive documents on
dangerous goods, which can comprise scientific tracts, within TUIS (Transport-
Accident-Information and Emergency Response System of the chemical industry).
The companies depend on access to and the possibility of archiving scientific literature
in electronic form, both when realising their research projects and in order to comply
with their legal obligations.
The keeping available of analogue reproductions in physical libraries no longer meets
the needs of modern workflows in the research departments of companies and in
dossier preparation. Today’s research activities of companies are usually carried out in
an interdisciplinary, decentralised – and partly cross-border – approach. The different
legal provisions and licensing models in the various EU Member States render this
cooperation between several countries very difficult, because it is only partly permitted
to exchange the required documents across national borders.
Most research projects stretch over several years. Therefore, it is essential for staff of
the involved departments to have fast and repeatable access to sources of scientific
findings – which needs to be ensured for various access points and at various times.
This is reliably possible only by enabling electronic access to existing literature.

Moreover, many legal requirements include the obligation to electronically submit
scientific literature sources. For example, electronic submission is mandatory for
information under the REACH Regulation or for documents in authorisation procedures
for medicines or plant protection products. Obviously, this presupposes that the
companies keep available the relevant items of information in electronic form.
In Germany neither the access to nor the archiving of scientific literature are regulated
in a manner satisfactory for industry.
In the implementation of Article 5 (3) (a) of Directive 2001/29/EC – by way of § 53 (2)
sentence 1 nos. 1 and 2 of the German copyright act (UrhG) – the German legislator
makes the admissibility of taking copies of scientific literature dependent on the
absence of a “commercial purpose”. The term “commercial purpose” is interpreted
widely so that all industrial companies work “commercially”. Consequently, the
companies themselves are not permitted to reproduce scientific literature for research
purposes.
Moreover, also in public libraries in Germany the transmission of electronic copies of
scientific literature is permitted only to the extent that this is justified by a non-
commercial purpose.
Companies are also not permitted to electronically archive reproductions of their own
work items, because the UrhG – § 53 (2) sentence 1 no. 2 in conjunction with sentence
2 nos. 2 and 3 – privileges solely the analogue use and publicly accessible archives,
respectively.
For this reason, at present the companies need to acquire separate licenses each for
their own reproductions of scientific literature for research purposes and for the
archiving of such reproductions. However, this does not meet the real needs of the
companies in many ways:


   Obtaining scientific literature within “package solutions” either does not cover all the
   relevant publishers, or costly multiple licensing must be accepted. Moreover,
   usually the right to electronically archive scientific literature is only limited or linked
   with further conditions. Additionally, the high costs of such licensing negatively
   impact especially small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs).
   Individual licensing through publishers involves much time and administration,
   causing excessive burdens particularly for SMEs in both industry and publishing;
   such companies usually lack the necessary resources in terms of personnel,
   organisation and finance. Moreover, obtaining scientific literature fast by way of
   individual purchases is normally not possible. In many cases, this runs counter to
   the legal obligations of a timely communication of scientific findings.

   Individual licensing through public libraries does not include the permission to
   electronically archive the thus obtained literature. This is excluded under the
   licensing agreement and technically not feasible, either.
   Licening of isolated articels for the purpose of electronic storage (archive) is often
   not provided by publishers or again involves much time and administration.
By contrast, Article 5 (3) (a) of Directive 2001/29/EC allows copies for scientific
research to the extent justified by a “non-commercial purpose”.
According to Recital 42 of Directive 2001/29/EC, when applying this exception,
“the non-commercial nature of the activity in question should be determined by that
activity as such. The organisational structure and the means of funding of the
establishment concerned are not the decisive factors in this respect.”
It would be desirable to amend Directive 2001/29/EC to the following effect:
Irrespective of the question whether a commercial purpose is pursed or not, storage
and reproduction should be permissible if the storage and reproduction of works serve
the purpose of complying with a legal obligation or with an order imposed by a public
authority or a law court. Then, this exception should apply to acts of use performed by
a service provider who is retained by the user and who serves the user for complying
with the legal obligation or with the order imposed by a public authority or law court
(e.g. a lawyer or a patent attorney).
Beyond the field of scientific literature, the purchase of licenses for the use of
copyright-protected works should be simplified generally – enabling the use of such
works also across national borders and at uniform conditions.
The multitude of contractual conditions and licensers renders the building up of internal
information systems highly complex and, consequently, cost-intensive. Here, firstly a
more uniform licensing practise, which ensures a certain “minimum standard” for
licensing conditions – would be helpful. Secondly a central licensing agency (like e.g.
a collecting society or a “clearing office”) would bring much improvement, because then
licensing would be necessary with only one or, at most, a small number of partners.
Such supplementary provisions could significantly improve the situation for industry.
