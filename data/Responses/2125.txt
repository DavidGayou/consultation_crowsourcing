                             Public Consultation
                   on the review of the EU copyright rules




Please identify yourself:





Name:


The Wroblewski Library of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences.





Type of respondent (Please underline the appropriate):

   ←  Institutional  user  (e.g.  school,  university,   research   centre,
     library, archive)  OR Representative of institutional users









 Access to content in libraries and archives






 28.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
     experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
     preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your
     collection?


€ YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and  the  type  of  use  in
question.


Having an agreement for archive of scientific  journal  we  do  not  have  a
possibility to use it after the subscription  expires.  Few  licenses  only,
negotiated by libraries or their consortia,  provide  for  the  delivery  of
files for local hosting and preservation purposes.  Some  others  contain  a
simple obligation to transfer the files in case we will not be able to  host
them.


If we have copies on CDs and DVDs, these materials may become  unusable  due
to technological obsolescence in a few years.


Legal deposit issues are not enough protected by  the  law.  Publishers  are
not following the legal copy issues sometimes.

29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Libraries should be granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free,  perpetual  right
to archive complete copies of subscribed online materials, and  to  use  the
archived materials in the event that access  on  the  original  platform  is
discontinued or suspended. An exception should ensure,  at  the  request  of
the library, the availability of back-up files for  long-term  preservation,
regardless of the format of publication.





Legal deposit act should be made compulsory for all publishers.


30. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary  institutions  should
be covered and under which conditions?


Subscribed online content can escape libraries preservation  scheme  because
of the absence of specific exceptions creates a huge risk of a 21st  century
black hole where a large amount of content could disappear forever.


Short term economic interests  shouldn’t  limit  long-term  preservation  of
human’s cultural heritage.

An updated copyright framework is needed to ensure specific  regulation  for
libraries and securing their public mission. In the case some uses  wouldn’t
be covered by an  exception,  a  “fair  use”  approach  would  therefore  be
necessary

Art. 5(2)(c) of the 2001/29/EC should be made mandatory. As  the  'Study  on
the application of directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related  rights  in
the information society' (page  301)  highlights  […]to  make  an  exception
mandatory could apply in the case of article 5(2) c), as the development  of
digital libraries is one of the key objectives of the  Digital  Agenda,  and
the digitization of cultural heritage is promoted by  the  Council  and  the
Commission […].


Art. 6 of the 2001/29/EC directive should be revised  in  order  to  enforce
exceptions  and  limitations  and  to  ensure  legitimate  utilizations   of
protected works, regardless of format or mode of dissemination.


31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


      Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

 32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
     experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
     rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
     across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
     of research and private study?





We usually entrust negotiation  and  management  of  contracts  to  national
institutional consortia to increase our bargaining power.


For more see the EBLIDA answer.

 33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Licences  of  digital  content  were   expected   to   extend,   not   limit
opportunities for access and  use  through  exceptions  and  limitations  to
exclusive rights. On the contrary,  exceptions  and  limitations  are  often
overridden by licences and  TPMs,  even  when  licences  are  negotiated  by
Library consortia.


There is a need to ensure that  contract/licences  don´t  override  existing
exceptions and limitations to copyright.




 34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
     its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
     should be covered and under which conditions?



A legislative solution should clarify that every kind  of  utilization  made
by libraries and cultural institutions  for  their  public-interest  mission
are allowed, no matter the medium of the transmission. Also the  legislative
orders should  be  made  compulsory  to  all  producers  and  publishers  of
information.





Moreover, contracts should not override any statutory  provisions  regarding
the entry of a work into the public domain.





 35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

      E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

 36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
     specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
     electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
     other materials held in your collection?


€ YES – Please explain with specific examples


Some publishers refused to supply their products to our library  because  of
our specifical structure – we hold branch libraries in research  institutes.
The latter were considered as separate libraries.


For open access we have low resolution digital copies.  Hope  it  will  give
answers to many questions.


We are participating in digitising projects, which will open access to  part
of our holdings. Users are willing to get access to high resolution.




 37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

We would recommend to follow the EBLIDA principles on  the  acquisition  and
access to e-books by  libraries  highlighting  among  others  the  following
needs:


●     All  e-book  titles  available  for  sale  to  the  public  should  be
available to libraries for acquisition and access;


●     All e-books titles should be available to libraries  at  the  time  of
publication;


●      Publishers  should  deliver  e-books  in  interoperable  formats,  or
cooperate with libraries in making interoperable formats;


●     Libraries should be permitted to make available acquired  or  licensed
e-books for a limited period of time to a user.


●     It should be possible to use the same e-book title simultaneously;


●     Authorised users should be able to download an e-book  either  in  the
library or by way of remote access via authentication systems.


 38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences  do
     you  see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,
     including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you
     encountered?

Management of physical collection includes additional services (cleaning,
binding, shelving, etc.) than the electronic. Electronic collection has
world-wide access, speed of service.
The service we provide depends of technical possibilities, financial
abilities to adopt the updates, maintain the system. Also the professional
education of the staff and user education is important.
The format and technology must not be an hindrance for access to books.
Legal mechanisms and terms should be equivalent for analog and digital
lending.

 39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
     between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
     consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
     (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
     you encountered?


      Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on  the  other[1].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[2].


 40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
     to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
     management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
     enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
     agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
     a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
     across the EU?


€ YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


The term Mass digitisation (as referred to in the  Orphan  Works  Directive)
applies to publicly accessible  libraries,  educational  establishments  and
museums, as well as by archives, film or  audio  heritage  institutions  and
public-service  broadcasting  organisations.  The  orphan  works   directive
contains a restrictive clause on diligent search that  makes  it  impossible
to use. The MoU on Out of Commerce Works might have solved the Orphan  Works
directive issue by addressing the  issue  from  a  broader  perspective.  In
addition to the fact that national laws fail to fully address the  needs  of
digital libraries, the MoU is severely  limited  by  its  lack  of  concrete
application across Europe and the lack of implementation  in  National  Law.
It is most probable that the question of cross-border access will be  better
solved by enabling an exception for publicly funded institution  for  making
available content resulting of Mass digitisation process by an extension  of
 articles 5 (2)c and 5(3)n of the Infosoc directive.





 41. Would it be necessary to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
     agreed for other types of content (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
     collections, broadcasters’ archives)?


€ YES – Please explain


The mechanism should be based on an exception allowing digitization  of  out
of print or lost items for libraries.


Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[3]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in   their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


 42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
     user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
     or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
     across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
 43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Licenses for electronic journals are usually very restrictive when it comes
to serving users outside of the institution, even electronic transmission
of single articles in pdf-format to external individual users or other
libraries. It can however be printed and sent by regular mail, which seems
rather odd these days.

The rule stating that licenses override copyright must be changed and
turned the other way around, so that exceptions override the license terms
if the licenses do not comply with exceptions in the copyright law.



 44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to  facilitate  the  use  of
     content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
     they?



 45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
     its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
     should be covered and under what conditions?


The mandatory educational exception should cover all uses of  all  types  of
works for illustration of teaching. It shall not be limited to any types  of
institution but rather defined by its purpose: teaching.


 46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


There shouldn’t be any different solution.



Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[4]  enables  Member  States  to  choose   whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

 47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
     user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
     or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research
     projects/activities, including across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

 49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate  the  use  of
     content for research purposes? How successful are they?

The law of research and studies of the Republic  of  Lithuania  (Nr  XI-424,
April 30, 2009, par. 45) indicate  a  rule  to  ensure  an  open  access  to
research results, if they we funded by state and do not  contradict  to  the
acts of intellectual property and state security.

Conflict sometimes appears when results are published in commercial sources

Content mining: The potential of text and data mining for scientific
research is enormous, and has been widely demonstrated.  It is a process
aimed to collect raw data (e.g., the occurrence of words, figures etc. in a
database), not creative expressions. Libraries are interested in such
utilization both for integrating content and metadata in their catalogues
and information systems, and for the benefit of their users. Undertaking
text and data mining of content to which researchers have already lawful
access (i.e. when a lawful user is recognized as such by a voluntary
licence (provided by the copyright holder) OR a legal licence (exception
provided by law). See recitals 34,49,50,51 of the Preamble of the Directive
96/9/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 11 March 1996 on
the legal protection of databases) should be considered a legitimate
utilization, and should not be subject to re-license. But there is not
legal certainty on this point, and most standard licences do not allow
content mining. As a consequence, in most cases researchers  give up
research, rather than addressing high transaction cost, both  direct (cost
of re-licensing) and indirect (the time needed to negotiate). For this, an
exception should explicitly legitimate text and data mining on content on
which researchers have lawful access, irrespective of whether this is text
and data mining for commercial or non-commercial purposes.





Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[5]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for   the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [6].

The Marrakesh Treaty[7] has been adopted to facilitate access  to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

 50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
     organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
     experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
     borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?



 (b) [In particular if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?

See answers by EBLIDA

 51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

For print disabled people, it is not possible to discriminate between  types
of handicap.

Accessibility  should  be  equitable  to  normal  reading:  that  means:  an
accessible version can be searched for, found and read  in  a  way  that  is
equitable to what sighted people can. This is sometimes referred to  as  the
ecosystem of reading. The availability of a simple (unstructured audio,  not
synchronized), is not enough to justify the  label  “accessible”  .  Sighted
people can flip  through  their  book,  browse  website,  order  books,  use
eReaders, search in eBooks etc. All these functions should  become  or  stay
available  to  the  print  disabled  readers  too.  A  clear  definition  of
accessibility is therefore needed.



 52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility
     to content? How successful are they?




Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[8]  are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for  Europe”[9].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

 53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
     user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when
     trying to use text or data mining methods, including across borders?


€ YES – Please explain


The potential of text and data mining for scientific research is enormous.


Undertaking text and data  mining  of  content  to  which  researchers  have
already lawful access should be considered  a  legitimate  utilization,  and
should not be subject to re-license. But there is  not  legal  certainty  on
this point, and most standard licences do not allow  content  mining.  As  a
consequence, in most  cases  researchers   give  up  research,  rather  than
addressing high transaction cost, both  direct (cost  of  re-licensing)  and
indirect (the time needed to  negotiate).  For  this,  an  exception  should
explicitly legitimate text and data mining on content on  which  researchers
have lawful access.


Even if content is openly available on the Web, without explicit  permission
indicating otherwise,  it is unclear if the copying of this content for  the
purpose of text and data mining is legal.


 54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

For this, an exception should explicitly legitimate text and data mining  on
content on which researchers have lawful access.
Researchers must be able to share the results of text and  data  mining,  as
long as these results are not substitutable for the original copyright  work
- irrespective of copyright law, database law or contractual  terms  to  the
contrary. A specific exception  to  this  effect  allowing  the  copying  of
content for the purpose of text and data mining is necessary.
 Such an exception  should  not  distinguish  between  commercial  and  non-
commercial purposes  as,  for  research  institutions,  this  would  prevent
knowledge transfer.
•     An exception for text and data mining would provide legal certainty;
•     Differentiating between commercial and non-commercial activity is  not
in the public interest.


 55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
     its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
     conditions?


A legislative solution should take the form of  an  exception  which  allows
the copying of content and the circumvention  of  TPMs  for  text  and  data
mining purposes. This exception must not be over-ridable by contracts.


 56. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?





 57. Are there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
     barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

For data in databases not owned by libraries or universities a license
agreement is needed. In that situation, TDM becomes a property right and a
security issue.


Even for the use of databases owned by libraries and universities security
can become a major issue.


User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[10]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[11].


 58. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
     experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing  works  or  other
     subject matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
     across borders?






(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?





(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?


€ YES  Usually it was a lack of copyright literacy for  library  users,  who
did not indicate the course they use correctly.


Sometimes it was technical problems of considering a illegal action when  it
was not, so the user education became an of important issues for our users.





 59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:]
     Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you
     have  created  (on  the  basis  of  pre-existing  works)  is  properly
     identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in  this
     context?


(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
possibilities for users that are  publishing/disseminating  the  works  they
have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through  your  service  to
properly identify these works for online use?


€ NO





 60. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer  or  a  right
     holder):] Have you experienced problems when trying to be  remunerated
     for the use of the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing
     works)?


(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?


€ NO





 61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?





 62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
     its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
     conditions?





 63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?






   I. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[12]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[13][14].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

 64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
     application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[15]  in
     the digital environment?

€ NO OPINION


 65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
     context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
     the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
     levies?[16]

€ Yes – Please explain


Registered Users of Library collections have a possibility  to  make  copies
for private use, but they are charged. Other citizens have  to  register  to
the library to get such service.


 66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
     services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
     instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
     development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
     rightholders’ revenue on the other?
  Demand should stimulate the  offer.  But  the  copyright  law  should  be
  applied.



 67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the  invoices
     for products subject to levies?[17]

€ YES – Please explain


It is necessary for transparency and the user’s right to be informed.





Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[18].

 68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
     resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
     levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

€ NO OPINION


 69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
     than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
     copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
     explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
     transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

NO OPINION
 70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
     affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
     reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
     the situation?

NO OPINION


 71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
     of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?


NO OPINION


  II. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[19] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[20]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

 72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
     mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
     adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
     performances?

Libraries should not be involved in  covering  remuneration  mechanisms  for
the use of information.


 73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
     certain clauses in contracts)?

€ YES.


Contract between  authors  and  publishers  (by  extension  Rights  holders)
benefiting from public grant for the publication of a work should contain  a
clause clearly  authorising  the  sale  of  the  said  work  in  any  format
(analogue and digital) to publicly funded  libraries  for  communication  to
the public, lending and e-lending (i.e. remote online  access  to  content).
This  would  apply  specifically  for  academic  and  research  publications
resulting from publicly funded research, but also for  fiction  and  popular
non-fiction where publication has been supported with public money.


 74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what  would
     you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

NO OPINION

 III. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[21] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[22].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[23]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[24].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

 75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
     efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
     purpose?

€ NO OPINION


 76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
     for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
     service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
     domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
     infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
     be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

Limitation of ISPs liability is important. Otherwise  there  is  a  risk  of
reducing  freedom  of  expression  and  freedom  of  communication.  Private
enforcement is unacceptable, regular legal processes must be followed.


The  general  term  “intermediary”  is  not  very  precise  and  can  create
uncertainty as to who is an intermediary. Libraries shall not be  considered
intermediaries in this context, or  any  legislation  should  seek  to  make
clear when libraries and educational establishments are in or out of  scope.
Libraries / educational establishments should be given  a  safe  harbour  in
law.



 77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
     balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
     respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
     protection of personal data?


  No – because, in  spite  of  copyright  law  and  law  of  personal  data
  protection – we still have cases of violation.



  IV. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

 78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
     as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
     exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
     for enforcement?

€ NO




 79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
     EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
     legislation mean that this is a longer term project?


The next  (urgent)  step  should  be  the  enlargement  and  enforcement  of
exceptions and limitations,  but  such  process  could  lead  to  a  broader
copyright reform.


The current level of differences  among  Member  State  Legislation  can  be
compared to the current differences among Member  State  social  system,  or
standard of living that cannot be fixed by a regulation.


Sorting out the current impediments due to  the  inadequacy  of  the  system
means to rethink the framework on long-term  (such  as  the  Wittem  Project
suggest) while acting now to enact  progressive  solutions  (see  answer  to
Q80).


   V. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

 80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
     framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
     should be addressed.

The orphan works directive contains a restrictive clause on diligent  search
that makes it impossible to use. The MoU on  Out  of  Commerce  Works  might
have solved the Orphan Works directive issue by addressing the issue from  a
broader perspective.
