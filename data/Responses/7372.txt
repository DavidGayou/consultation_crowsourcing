Please see my answers to question 72-74 below
I have no opinion on the questions 75-80


  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

[Open question]

The best solution is a combination  of  exclusive  rights  and  remuneration
rights:


- The exclusive rights, granted by EU legislation, must be  fully  respected
in order to allow individual and collective bargaining on  important  issues
such as: re-broadcasting, sales to foreign countries (broadcasting),  dvd’s,
online use etc.


-  However,  when  it  comes  to  cross-border  online  use  of  audiovisual
productions, the  negotiation  on  basis  of  exclusive  rights  has  severe
shortcomings. Many performers do not have any bargaining strength, and  even
those who have are not able to estimate the value  of  such  use.  Even  the
broadcasters and producers cannot foresee the interest in  the  productions.
This is creating immense difficulties in the  negotiations  and  constitutes
an obstacle to cross border online use. This is why the EU must introduce  a
supplementary unwaivable right to remuneration for the cross border  use  of
audiovisual performances. A  similar  right  exists  regarding  the  use  of
commercial phonograms for broadcasting and communication to the public,  and
this regime facilitates an easy access for users to the  use  of  commercial
phonograms, and guaranties at the same time, that performers receive a  fair
remuneration for the use of  their  performances.  An  unwaivable  right  to
remuneration would help the development of a single market  for  audiovisual
productions.

  73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?

( YES – Please explain


The EU  should  protect  performers  when  signing  a  contract,  since  the
performer will always be in a weak  bargaining  position.  Transfer  of  all
rights in return for a lump  sum  should  not  be  allowed,  not  even  when
specifying payment for each use, since neither of the parties  are  able  to
estimate the value of the rights at the point of  contract.  The  EU  should
introduce a principle of fair ongoing payment for  any  use  of  audiovisual
performances.


  74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what  would
      you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?
