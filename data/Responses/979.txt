   I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]





   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)


X NO


€ NO OPINION





   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).

X NO    Il n’y a pas réellement de difficultés pour proposer  des  accès  ou
des exploitations transfrontalières.
Le problème est plutôt d’obtenir le paiement des exploitations.

€ NO OPINION





   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.

Les auteurs sont systématiquement confrontés à des contrats de  cession  qui
couvrent tous les territoires du monde.
Quand il y a des sociétés de  gestion  collective  dans  leur  secteur,  les
auteurs font apport de leurs droits  à  ces  sociétés.  Ce  sont  elles  qui
gèrent les autorisations d’utilisation dans le monde. En  échange,  ils  ont
la possibilité de percevoir la  juste  rémunération  pour  la  diffusion  de
leurs œuvres.




   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


X YES – Please explain by giving examples

Dans certains secteurs de la création, il faut  organiser  la  diffusion  de
l’œuvre pour atteindre un niveau suffisant de son financement.
Par exemple sur le marché du livre, la cession de droits exclusifs pour  une
traduction dans une langue et/ou un territoire  donné,  est  une  source  de
rémunération partagée entre les auteurs et les éditeurs.

€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain


X NO – Please explain

L’UE doit d’abord garantir le respect du droit  légitime  des  créateurs  de
vivre de leur métier et  du  produit  de  l’exploitation  de  leurs  œuvres.
Sinon, comment les auteurs et créateurs pourront-ils vivre  de  leur  métier
et s’y consacrer pleinement ?

€ NO OPINION


Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]





The act of “making available”





   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[1])

X NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[2])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


€ NO


X NO OPINION


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation





  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")


€ NO


X NO OPINION


Linking and browsing


  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


X YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why

Les hyperliens  sont  nombreux  et  très  différents  les  uns  des  autres.
Impossible donc d’avoir une réponse unique.
Quand un opérateur  retire  un  avantage  économique  ou  financier  de  ses
actions en utilisant du contenu protégé ou en  présentant  les  accès  à  ce
contenu protégé, il doit absolument obtenir au  préalable  une  autorisation
des ayants droit et convenir avec eux de la rémunération qui leur revient.

€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)


€ NO OPINION


  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)


X NO OPINION


Download to own digital content




  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.

La  revente  de  fichiers  numériques   (livre,   musique,   film,   autres)
introduirait un bouleversement économique radical dont on  ne  peut  mesurer
les conséquences. Cela  constituerait  une  concurrence  directe  au  marché
primaire.
Naturellement, cela  remettrait  également  en  cause  la  rémunération  des
titulaires de droits et donc de leur survie.
Quel serait le cadre légal qui encadrerait une telle pratique,  assurant  la
protection de tous ?

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?





  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES


X NO


€ NO OPINION





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

Coût de création et de fonctionnement d’un tel système ?
Système  ingérable  techniquement.  Comment  le  tenir  en  temps  réel,  en
répertoriant tous les ayants droit, toutes les œuvres,  partout,  dans  tous
les états membres, etc. ? Comment s’assurer que les informations  reçues  et
enregistrées sont exactes ?
Quelles informations accessibles ? À qui ?




  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

Quoi qu’il en soit, aucune mesure ne devra porter atteinte sur la nature  ou
le périmètre des droits d’auteur reconnus sur l’œuvre.





How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers





  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

X YES – Please explain

Jusqu’ici,  la  politique  menée  par  la  Commission  européenne  visait  à
protéger les industries culturelles  européennes  (notamment  par  le  biais
d’une durée de protection appropriée) et permettre  leur  développement.  Il
serait dommage de mettre cette action en péril.
La durée de protection actuelle permet en  effet  aux  auteurs  et  à  leurs
héritiers  de  percevoir  la  rémunération   de   leur   travail…   celle-ci
intervenant parfois tardivement !

€ NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter


€ NO OPINION


  II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market




21. Are there problems arising from the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
    exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the
    Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION


22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
    there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


X NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION



23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or  removed  from
    the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide  for
    a greater degree of flexibility in  the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
    limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why


X NO – Please explain why

Une exception au droit d’auteur remet en question les droits de l’auteur.
Si exception au droit d’auteur il y a, elle doit  être  justifiée.  Elle  ne
doit pas viser des  publics dont l’importance et  le  nombre  remettrait  en
cause l’économie de  la  production  des  créations,  et  donc  le  droit  à
rémunération des auteurs sur la diffusion de leurs œuvres.
Le droit d’auteur serait-il appelé à devenir  une  exception ?  Certainement
pas !

€ NO OPINION


25. If yes, what would be the best approach  to  provide  for  flexibility?
    (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions
    of  the  directives,  interpretations  by  the   Commission,   built-in
    flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
    open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the  relative
    advantages and disadvantages  of  such  an  approach  as  well  as  its
    possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
    experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to


€ NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


€ NO OPINION


27. In the event that limitations and exceptions  established  at  national
    level were to have cross-border effect,  how  should  the  question  of
    “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation is part of the
    exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

Access to content in libraries and archives



Preservation and archiving





28. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
    experienced specific problems  when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
    preserve and archive specific works or other  subject  matter  in  your
    collection?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

€ YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and  the  type  of  use  in
question.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed,  what  would  be

    research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?


33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?



34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed,  what  would  be
    its main elements? Which activities  of  the  beneficiary  institutions
    should be covered and under which conditions?


35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


E – lending



36.  (a) [In particular  if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
    specific problems when trying to negotiate  agreements  to  enable  the
    electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of  books  or
    other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

X YES – Please explain with specific examples


Dans  le  domaine  de  l’écrit,  des  discussions  sont   en   cours   entre
représentants des auteurs, des éditeurs et des bibliothèques pour  envisager
un accord et un Code des bons usages entre professionnels.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION


37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What  differences  do
    you see in the management of physical and online collections, including
    providing  access  to  your  subscribers?  What   problems   have   you
    encountered?



39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you  see
    between  libraries’  traditional   activities   such   as   on-premises
    consultation or public lending  and  activities  such  as  off-premises
    (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems  have
    you encountered?

Dans le cadre d’une numérisation des œuvres, il est important de  veiller  à
la qualité et à l’intégrité des œuvres. Le  risque  de  piratage  doit  être
envisagé, tout comme le système de protection des œuvres. Et les  conditions
de rémunération des ayants droit.

    across the EU?


€ YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION





41. Would it be necessary  to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already

remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?


€ YES – Please explain


€ NO – Please explain

La création d’une œuvre nouvelle à partir d’une  ou  de  plusieurs  œuvre(s)
protégée(s) existe déjà.
Les accords et les contrats avec  les  auteurs  des  œuvres  d’origine,  les
cessionnaires de droits ou les  sociétés  de  gestion  de  droits  régissent
cette question.

€ NO OPINION





61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?





62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed,  what  would  be
    its main elements? Which activities should be covered  and  under  what
    conditions?


63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?



 III. Private copying and reprography


64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope  and
    application of the private copying and reprography exceptions[3] in the
    digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain


X NO – Please explain

La copie privée permet de répartir aux  auteurs  et  aux  ayants  droit  les
sommes dues au titre de la rémunération à leur revenir.  Cette  rémunération
compense le préjudice causé par des  techniques  qui  permettent  au  public
d’accéder largement à des contenus protégés de façon massive.
La copie privée permet aussi le financement de manifestations  et  d’actions
culturelles.

€ NO OPINION


65. Should digital copies made by end users for  private  purposes  in  the
    context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and  where
    the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to  private  copying
    levies?[4]

X YES – Please explain


Voir réponse n° 64.


€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION


66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application  to  online
    services  (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing  allowing,   for
    instance, users  to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
    development and functioning of new business models on the one hand  and
    rightholders’ revenue on the other?



67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the  invoices
    for products subject to levies?[5]

€ YES – Please explain


€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION


68. Have you experienced  a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
    resulted in undue levy payments, or  duplicate  payments  of  the  same
    levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

€ YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate  the  percentage
of the undue payments. Please also indicate how a  priori  exemption  and/or
ex post reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.


€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION


69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons  other
    than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying?
    Do any of those transactions result in undue payments?  Please  explain
    in  detail  the  example  you  provide  (type  of  products,  type   of
    transaction, stakeholders, etc.).


70. Where such undue payments arise,  what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
    affect? To what  extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
    reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help to remedy the
    situation?


71. If you have identified specific problems with the  current  functioning
    of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?


  IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers


72. [In particular if you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
    mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive  an
    adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of   your   works   and
    performances?
La rémunération proportionnelle car ce système associe  l’auteur  au  succès
de l’exploitation et de la diffusion de  ses  œuvres…  à  condition  que  la
transparence du partage soit de mise  entre  exploitants  ou  diffuseurs  et
auteurs. Dans certains cas, notamment  dans  l’environnement  numérique,  un
minimum garanti devrait être associé au pourcentage fixé.
Dans certains secteurs ou pour certains  droits,  les  systèmes  de  gestion
collective mis en place par ou pour les auteurs sont une bonne chose.

73. Is there a need to act at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
    certain clauses in contracts)?
X YES – Please explain
Il ne s’agit pas ici  d’une  harmonisation  européenne  par  le  plus  petit
dénominateur commun des règles juridiques en vigueur dans  l’UE  en  matière
de droit d’auteur.
L’Union  Européenne  pourrait,   en   revanche,   fixer   certaines   lignes
directrices dans le  cas  où  l’auteur  se  verrait  proposer  des  contrats
exclusifs de cession parfois coercitifs.
Il n’est pas toujours facile pour un auteur  de  véritablement  négocier  un
contrat de cession qui est imposé par  un  éditeur.  De  même  l’auteur  n’a
aucun moyen réel de s’assurer que les comptes envoyés par son  éditeur  sont
transparents, réels et conformes au contrat.
Enfin, il est difficile pour un auteur de sortir d’un contrat  même  si,  de
toute évidence, son œuvre n’est plus exploitée comme elle le devrait.

€ NO – Please explain why


€ NO OPINION


74. If you consider that the current rules are not  effective,  what  would
    you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

L’Union Européenne pourrait  obliger  les  états  membres  à  organiser  des
négociations interprofessionnelles, par  secteur,  entre  les  organisations
représentatives des auteurs et celles  représentatives  des  éditeurs  et/ou
producteurs.

   V. Respect for rights



75. Should the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
    efficient for infringements of copyright committed  with  a  commercial
    purpose?

X YES – Please explain

Un renforcement des sanctions concernant les infractions au  droit  d’auteur
commises dans un but commercial serait utile. Mais cela ne doit pas  laisser
la porte ouverte à une exonération totale des infractions au droit  d’auteur
qui auraient été commises « sans  usage  commercial »…  notion  difficile  à
définir dans l’environnement numérique, notamment.

€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION


76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear  enough  to  allow
    for  sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service
    providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain  name
    registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements  with  a
    commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the
    cooperation of intermediaries?


77. Does the current civil enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
    balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected
    and other rights such as the protection of private life and  protection
    of personal data?

€  YES – Please explain


€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION


  VI. A single EU Copyright Title


78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright  Title,
    as a means of  establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
    exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as  a  single  framework
    for enforcement?

€ YES


X NO


En l’état actuel, une harmonisation éventuelle  ne  se  ferait  que  par  un
nivellement par le bas.


Or le travail des auteurs et les droits sur l’exploitation des  œuvres  sont
à la base d’une source économique importante en Europe  (plusieurs  millions
d’emplois dans les industries culturelles européennes et chiffre  d’affaires
de ces secteurs non négligeable dans le PIB des états membres).


€ NO OPINION




79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU?
    Does the current level of difference among the Member State legislation
    mean that this is a longer term project?



 VII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework
    for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters  should  be
    addressed.


La  consultation  lancée  par  la  Commission  européenne  appelle  quelques
remarques.


Le délai octroyé pour répondre (même s’il a été repoussé) est beaucoup  trop
court. Les questions sont  nombreuses  et  souvent  techniques  et  auraient
demandé plus de temps pour s’informer et se faire une opinion (d’où les  non
réponses à certaines d’entre elles).


Il est totalement anormal que la  consultation  n’ait  été  publiée  par  la
commission que dans une version  anglaise.  Cela  engendre  des  confusions,
entre copyright et droits d’auteur. D’ailleurs, le terme authors  right  law
n’est jamais cité !


Une  étude  préalable  des  impacts  économiques  et  juridiques  dans   les
différents  pays  de  l’Union  dans  les  divers  secteurs  des   industries
culturelles aurait été intéressante.  Il  serait  en  effet  intéressant  de
mesurer  l’importance  de  l’activité  des  créateurs  sur   l’économie   et
l’emploi.


« L’importance économique » du numérique ne peut à elle seule  justifier  le
lancement de  cette  consultation  et  l’éventualité  de  modifications  des
règles. Quelle étude permet d’évaluer les gains éventuels… et les pertes ?


Si la Commission devait envisager certaines évolutions des règles  de  droit
d’auteur en  Europe,  elle  devra  aussi  s’occuper  du  vrai  problème  qui
concerne les créateurs : le transfert de valeur qui  s’opère  au  profit  de
certains intermédiaires techniques de l’Internet  (tels  que,  par  exemple,
Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, etc.) au  détriment  des  auteurs  et  plus
largement de tous les acteurs des industries culturelles.

[1] The objective of implementing a  “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[2] Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the  right
holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.
