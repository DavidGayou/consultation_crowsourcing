58. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems

when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on

the Internet, including across borders?

(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users

publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter

through your service, including across borders?

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from

the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new

content on the Internet, including across borders?

Yes. As a open source software developer, I have often googled for a particular element I needed in
producing a tool and have found that no license exists for it. I think my license information I gathered
together demonstrates some of my issues:

1. The Money project is taken from: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/vb/moneyDatatype.aspx

License: None given and no way of contacting the developer.

Developer: chimeric69

2. The calendar picker: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7tas5c80.aspx#Y181

License: None given, likely MLPL.

Developer: Microsoft

As you can see here both a piece from a professional tutorial site and from Microsoft did not include any
sort of license and left me wondering if it was public domain, licensed or not. Even if you argue that a
simple developer shouldn't need to know to mark their code as public (licensed) or not, Microsoft
should be clear. Maybe they are, but I couldn't find the right page which in and of itself is evidence of a
failure.



80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for

copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
In the United States, there is a program for the blind, where the blind get books read by non-
professional readers. One such book was by a long gone author, Robert A. Heinlein. There is no
commercial audio book. I did buy the paper back, but the paperback didn't read to me and at the time, I
was doing a lot of work where I could listen, but not read. I thus found an audio book form ,but could
find nowhere to buy it. I ended up using the downloadable "free" version, not knowing it was for the
blind until they said something. So a tax-payer funded book, with no commercial alternative which I
suspect was not legal to download was the only way I could listen to the book. The book was over 40
years old, and clearly no one thought it was worth making an audiobook of. I had already 'paid' the
publisher. I can't see what I did was wrong, even though I suspect it was not legal.

What do we as consumers do when a illegal product exists, but no legal form of a product exists and
there is not enough market to justify a professional work? For example, you could imagine an
audiobook created for a book written in the 1970s by a non-professional Maybe they read the book
outloud for a friend in the hospital and sent him the MP3s over email. This clearly violates copyright,
even though if the friend was reading the book outloud in the hospital to their friend it would cause no
issue. Worse yet, after having read the book and sent the files, if they were later upload to the internet,
the reader would be responsible for multiple copyright infringements. It seems like items which are not
being commercially exploited and haven't been for years should not be a legal hurtle.

Another issue that is of concern is that nearly all of the internet remains unlicensed yet is clearly
'copyrighted'. Literally when you visit a webpage, you download the contents of the site, just before it
puts it on your screen. This is known as caching. This is required to view the contents. Now, my
understanding of the legal theory is, you get to go to a homepage (as that is considered reasonable) and
see the privacy/usage/rights statements without causing a copyright issue. Anything beyond that could
be. So what do we do with all the pages, like my blog, which don't have a rights page. Is the
downloader responsible for knowing or figuring out my copyrights? They already made a copy of the
content, so clearly they think they have rights. Can I sue them? When is it reasonable to assume
content is meant to be freely viewed and when isn't it? If I have to change a URL to get to content, am I
now 'hacking' to get content? For example, this young man (http://deedy.quora.com/Hacking-into-the-
Indian-Education-System) found that the student IDs of all the students were in numeric order and by
changing a URL he could see all the grades. IF those grades (or comparable content) were copyrighted,
but without notice, would that script be causing mass copyright violations?

 Yet another concern I have is with the ever expanding length of copyrights. I think there are a couple of
ways to deal with it. One is to roll copyrights back, ideally to ~10-25 years, particularly since electronics
move so much faster than books do. I have no problem with electronic versions of things having a
different expiration date than physical goods, and I think that could be reasonable. Alternatively, to
keep The Mouse safe, maybe we could have a method of re-registering with a cost growing every 10
years. For example, it could be free for the first 10 years. Then 100 dollars for the next 10 years, then
500, then 1500, then 5000, then .... There are many ways of making it so that the majority of the
content doesn't remain in copyright forever while still allowing those who care about keeping their
content can for a long period of time.
One final issue I think should be considered. Sometimes something has an expired copyright in one
country but not another. Amazon recently ran into this with 1984
(http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html?_r=0). From my
understanding, Amazon believed the book to no longer have copyright because it had expired in
Australia. They downloaded a copy FROM Australia TO the United States. In the United States, the
copyright was still good. The question is, did they violate the copyright laws? Whose laws apply and at
what point. If they had printed a copy in Australia, without copyright, and shipped it to the US, would
that have been a violation and would that differ from the electronic copy?

13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when

trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

Yes. I use "Steam" (http://store.steampowered.com/) and while I appreciate a lot of what they do, they
do not let me resell any of my games. Now they have 'packs' of games, like everything made by Sega
which you can buy. However, if you already own some Sega games, you don't get a second copy to sell
or give to a friend. Instead, you just don't get as many games if you buy one. This seems rather unfair.
Even games I already own, cannot be resold or transferred. Effectively, a purchased game is mine
forever without any ability to do anything with it.



64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of

the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?

I have seen many online services shut off one day and then you no longer have access to your content. I
tend to not use those services because I don't want to lose my content. I fear that Microsoft will shut
down the Xbox360 services they currently have. I have 2 xbox 360s, one at my mom's house and one at
my home. When I visit with my mom, sometimes I will play a game, but because of how Microsoft
works, any of my online content doesn't easily transfer between systems. I can transfer my profile,
which can take 10 minutes but that requires I am online. There is no way of me 'backing up' my profile
onto a second system, you are only allowed one active profile. If they shut off the service, like they did
for the Xbox, I will have no way of transfer profiles even, which will completely lock my content away on
one system.



23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing

catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

I don't create AMVs, Anime Music Videos, but I do enjoy them as they introduce me to both new Anime
and new Music. Often they are highly creative and are never done as a professional work. I also work in
software, where people share code, often without attribution or license. For example
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/435553/java-reflection-performance has code but no license. In
fact, there are hundreds of thousands of stackoverflow questions just like that one, all of which are
limited pieces of code, but could be copyrighted and thus unusable.



22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for

a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

Yes. I work in the US, but I have a conference in the Netherlands in June. I have no idea what the
copyright laws are in regards to my presentation and while I doubt I'd get into trouble, a single entity
controlling these laws would help me research the question faster.
