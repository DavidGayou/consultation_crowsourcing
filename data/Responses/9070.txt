   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[9] and enable on-site consultation of the works and other  subject
matter in the collections  of  such  institutions[10].  The  public  lending
(under an exception or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of  physical
copies of works and other subject matter  is  governed  by  the  Rental  and
Lending Directive[11].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.


  28. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
      preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your
      collection?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

€ YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and  the  type  of  use  in

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]

Certains fournisseurs d’œuvres en ligne, comme Iznéo (Bandes-dessinées),  ne
proposent pas d’offre “hors les murs” aux bibliothèques.  Cette  restriction
enlève de la pertinence à l’offre car le prêt  à  domicile  est  fondamental
pour favoriser la lecture  dans  le  sens  des  missions  des  bibliothèques
publiques, surtout pour les œuvres de création.






  33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

Il serait plus juste que la réglementation précise que la seule  distinction
possible est celle qui sépare les usagers de la bibliothèque (qu’ils  soient
dans les murs de la bibliothèque ou en dehors) et le public non-usager.




  34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]

La  réglementation  devrait  recommander  que  les  négociations  entre  les
fournisseurs  et  les  bibliothèques  n’évoquent  comme  usagers  que  « les
usagers  de  la  bibliothèque ».  Il  est  de  la   responsabilité   de   la
bibliothèque d’établir elle-même, dans le cadre de sa politique  culturelle,
les critères lui permettant d’identifier ses usagers dans la population.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

( YES – Please explain with specific examples


1. Les négociations portent sur une cession de droits dont la  nature  n’est
pas bien définie : achat, location, durée des droits etc.


2. Les données d’utilisation des œuvres par  les  usagers  (big  data),  qui
sont confidentielles, sont directement gérées par le fournisseur.


3. Les DRM dans les œuvres numériques influent sur  les  conditions  d’usage
des œuvres  par  les  usagers  (chronodégradabilité  etc.),  alors  que  ces
conditions relèvent de la politique de lecture publique des bibliothèques.


4. Les catalogues des œuvres (livres  numériques,  CD,  DVD)  proposées  aux
bibliothèques ne comprennent pas toute  la  production  d’œuvres  numériques
disponibles au public.


5. Le prix des œuvres numériques est plus élevé pour les  bibliothèques  que
pour  le  public,  ce  qui  contrarie  leur   mission   de   démocratisation
culturelle.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION


  37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
1. La réglementation devrait lever l’insécurité juridique des contrats de
mise à disposition d’œuvre numérique par les bibliothèques, soit en
imposant la nature des droits cédés, soit a minima en imposant que les
caractéristiques et les durées de ces droits soient précisément décrits
dans le contrat.
2. La réglementation doit protéger les usagers de l’exploitation de leurs
données d’usage des œuvres numériques à travers leurs bibliothèques. Pour
cela elle doit rappeler la confidentialité de ces informations, même
anonymes, qui ne peuvent être accessibles automatiquement par une entité
extérieure à la bibliothèque. L’échange d’informations statistiques ou
d’extraits de données entre les bibliothèques et leurs fournisseurs relève
des négociations contractuelles.
3. La réglementation doit préciser que la mise à disposition des œuvres
numériques aux bibliothèques par les éditeurs ou les agrégateurs relève du
format « B to B », tandis que le « B to C » ressortit aux bibliothèques qui
ont la responsabilité de leurs relations avec leurs usagers. Les conditions
d’accès des usagers aux œuvres numériques par leurs bibliothèques publiques
ne peuvent être imposées par les fournisseurs.
4. Toutes les œuvres numériques mises à disposition du public doivent être
proposées aux bibliothèques au même moment.
5. La réglementation doit indiquer que le prix des œuvres numériques pour
les bibliothèques publiques, s’ils peuvent être augmentés de droits
particuliers (droit de prêt par exemple), ne peuvent in fine être
supérieurs au prix des œuvres numériques vendues au public, ni au prix de
la même œuvre sous forme physique.
The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

  38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences  do
      you  see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,
      including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you
      encountered?

1. Les droits acquis par les bibliothèques par les contrats de cession
d’œuvre numériques ne sont pas clairs pour les œuvres numériques. Ainsi,
l’achat d’un livre physique provoque l’épuisement des droits d’auteur et la
bibliothèque constitue une collection dont elle est propriétaire, ce qui
est différent pour les œuvres numériques. La nature et les
caractéristiques, y compris dans le temps, des droits pour les œuvres
numériques doivent être précisées : achat, location pour une durée
déterminée etc.
2. La distinction entre les usagers intra-muros / extra-muros n’existe pas
pour les collections physiques. Or il s’agit d’une distinction qui apparaît
pour les œuvres numériques, alors qu’elle n’est pas pertinente pour les
bibliothèques et leurs usagers. S’il doit y avoir une distinction entre les
publics, elle ne peut se faire qu’entre les usagers de la bibliothèque et
le reste du public. Les critères pour distinguer ses usagers des non-
usagers relèvent de la bibliothèque.

  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?
