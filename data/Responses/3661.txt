Introduction

Contextof the consultation

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet
have reshaped the ways in which content is created,
distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised
for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, anovel,
a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for
institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research
and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –
for information, education or entertainment purposes –
regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is
for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of
distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to
ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and
enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these
challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework
stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support
creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single
Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote
cultural diversity.

In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1

COM (2012)789 final, 18/12/2012.

the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action:on the one
hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework2

As announced in the Intellectual Property Strategy ' A single
market for Intellectual Property Rights: COM (2011)287 final,
24/05/2011.

"Based on market studies and impact assessment and legal
drafting work"as announced in the Communication (2012)789.

with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table
legislative reform proposals, andon the other, to facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder
dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4

See the document “Licences for Europe – tem pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

. The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders
have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four
Working Groups (cross border portability of services,
user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these
pledges to be a further step in making the user environment
easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes
note of the fact that two groups – user-generated content and
text and data mining – did not reach consensus among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be
addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of
"Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in the
context of the review of the legislative framework.

As part of the review process, theCommission is now launching a
public consultation on issues identified in the Communication
on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:"territoriality
in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and
exceptions to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of
the EU copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness
and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy
in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the
October 2013 European CouncilConclusions5

EUCO169/13, 24/25 October 2013.

"Providing digital services and content across the single market
requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the digital
age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review
of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important
to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of
intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural
diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public
hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright
in the knowledge economy"6

COM(2008)
466/3,http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/copyright-infso/index_en.htm#maincontentSec2.

, the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual
works"7

COM(2011) 427
final,http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2011/audiovisual_en.htm.

and "Content Online"8

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2009/content_online_en.htm.

. These consultations provided valuable feedback from
stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as
the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome
territoriality, exceptions related to the online
disseminationof knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration,
particularly in the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by
stakeholders representing all stages in the value chain,
including right holders, distributors, consumers, and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the
best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The
replies to the "Green Paper on the online distribution of
audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current
review process.

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why isit not possible to access many online content services
from anywhere in Europe?[The territorial scope of the rights
involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the
market through licensing agreements]

Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers,
musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,
they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights
in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised
by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and
the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the
territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced
on a country-by-country basis under national law9

This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on
several occasions.

.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet
– e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online e-book
seller – therefore requires, in principle, anauthorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to
the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant
a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across
borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to
facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a
Directive on Collective Rights Management10

Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 11 July2012 on collective management of copyright
and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in
musical works for online uses in the internal market, COM(2012)
372 final.

should significantly facilitate the delivery of
multi-territorial licences in musical works for online
services11

Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in
the management of online rights for musical works in contrast
to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by
right holders such as filmor record producers or by newspaper
or book publishers.

; the structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences for Europe”12

You can find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/.

and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13

You can find more information on the following
website:http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org/.

.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue
of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers
having subscribed to online services in their Member State to
keep accessing them when travelling temporarilyto other Member
States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector
issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue
working towards the further development of cross-border
portability14

See the document “Licences for Europe – tem pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the
cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These
problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access
services that are made available in Member States other than
the one in which they live. Not all online services are
available in all Member States and consumers face problems when
trying to access such services across borders. In some
instances, even if the “same” service is available in all
Member States, consumers cannot access the service across
borders (they can only access their “national” service, and if
they try to access the "same" service in another Member State
they are redirected to the one designated for their country of
residence).

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of
rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights
in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing
agreements between right holders and distributors and/or
between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of
some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further
measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15

For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a
European Copyright Code (establishing a single title) see
section VII of this consultation document.

to increase the cross-border availability of content services in
the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
protection for right holders.

[In particular if you arean end user/consumer:]Have you faced
problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member
State other than the one in which you live?

 YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State,
the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and
newspapers, games, applications and other software)

Yes. For example, some multimedia content on polish local media
websites (i.e. gazeta.pl) is inaccessible from other EU
countries. However, more importantly, significant portions of
content on popular websites like YouTube are unavailable when
accessed from within Germany. This is due to actions of
Collective Society GEMA.

 NO

NO OPINION

[In particular if you are a service provider:]Have you faced
problems when seeking to provide online services across borders
in the EU?

 YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your
experience, are related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.
business decisions relating to the cost of providing services
across borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer
protection)? Please provide examples indicating the Member
State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g.
premiumcontent such as certain films and TV series,
audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other
software).

From a customer's point of view - yes. For example, some
multimedia content on polish local media websites (i.e.
gazeta.pl) is inaccessible from other EU countries. However,
more importantly, significant portions of content on popular
websites like YouTube are unavailable when accessed from within
Germany. This is due to actions of Collective Society GEMA. Also
some products expanding legally purchased games were unavailable
in Poland (i.e. Mass Effect 2:
http://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=52636 (article in
Polish)). Most importantly though, numerous digital
copyright-protected products, although obtainable in physical
form, cannot be legally used outside digital borders or resold
due to digital restrictions.

 NO

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you are a right holder or a collective
management organisation:]How often are you asked to grant
multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the
Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.

[Open question]

Whenever I uploadcontent to a web service - several thousand
times a year as a single person. More importantly, this amount
would easily become ten times bigger if it were not due to
legal uncertainties and risk of dealing with alleged copyright
infringement. Both problemspointed out in answers to other
questions.

If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the
questions above – what would be the best way to tackle them?

[Open question]

Any location-based restrictions of access to content on websites
mustbe forbidden. In other words, there must be no borders in
digital world.

[In particular if you are a right holder or a collective
management organisation:]Are there reasons why, even in cases
where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories
in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in
order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content
is not possible in certain European countries)?

 YES – Please explain by giving examples

There are none. Any such situation is most undesired. Any
restrictions would mean that content created by me would not
reach some potential customers/consumers.

 NO

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service
provider:]Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have
acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in
order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different
website than the one he is trying to access)?

 YES – Please explain by giving examples

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO

 NO OPINION

Do you think that further measures (legislative or
non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at
EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level
of protection for right holders?

 YES – Please explain

Current lack of single digital market within EU is unacceptable.
Any restrictions of access within EU; any cases when one has to
wonderwhat is legal and what is not are bad for both creators
and consumers of content.

 NO – Please explain

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of
whatneeds to be authorised (or not) in digital
transmissions?[The definition of the rights involved in digital
transmissions]

The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related
rights in the digital environment is largely established by
Directive 2001/29/EC16

Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects
of copyright and related rights in the information society.

on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related
rights in the information society. OtherEU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those
relating to the protection of software17

Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer
programs.

and databases18

Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.

.

Directive 2001/29/ECharmonises the rights of authors and
neighbouring rightholders19

Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are
holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in, respectively,
their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’
content protected by copyright is referred to as a “work” or
“works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is
referred to as “other subject matter”.

which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of
works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g.
a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.

The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the
reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the
making of copies20

The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect,
temporary orpermanent reproduction by any means and in any
form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC)
although temporary acts of reproduction of a transient or
incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see
art. 5(1) of Directive2001/29/EC).

, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the
uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of
making it available – and at the users’ end – e.g. when a user
downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to
the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise
or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks21

The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the
public by wire or wireless means and to authorise or
prohibitthe making available to the public “on demand” (see
Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions
and both need to be cleared.

The act of “making available”

Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neitherwhatiscovered by the
making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by
the public, the actual reception by the public) norwherethe act
of “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions
if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise
however when the transmission covers several territories and
rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available"
happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the
countries where the content is potentially accessible? in
eachof the countries where the content is effectively
accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of
the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is
the “targeting” of a certain Member State's public22

See in particular CaseC-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar)
and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related rights, and
Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to
jurisdiction see also joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09
(Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) andpending CaseC-441/13 (Pez
Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach, Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which
are “targeted” by the online service provider. A service
provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via
advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency
specifically targeted at that group.

Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border
situations – i.e. when content is disseminated across borders –
sufficiently clear?

 YES

 NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what
type of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"
approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach23

The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is
tolocalise the copyright relevant act that must be licenced in
a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be
for example the Member State in which the content is uploaded
or where the service provider is established), regardless of in
how many Member States the work can be accessed or received.
Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with
regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright and
rights related to copyright applicable to satellite
broadcasting and cable retransmission).

)

No. Practice shows that this uncertainty is misused and abused
to restrict the freedom of expression of EU citizens. Even
more, this uncertainty is widely used to further extend current
overly broad and restrictive copyright laws. Technologies like
embedding and framing, cultural practices like compiling and
remixing are de facto transcending borders, so any territorial
limitations defined by the terms like 'targeting', 'country
oforigin' or 'making available' make no sense.

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you are a right holder:]Could a clarification
of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have
an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you
are considered to be an author or not, whether you are
considered to have transferred your rights or not), onyour
remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
availability of injunctive relief24

Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing
the right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her
right.

)?

 YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be
addressed

A simple, clear, technology-neutral definition of "making
available" ascertaining that no territorial limitations or ANY
other restrictions on the availability of content can be
imposed at any point will prevent problems described in point
8.

 NO

 NO OPINION

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the
current state of technology and law) several reproductions.
This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available
right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online
use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

[In particular if you aservice provider or a right holder:]Does
the application of two rights to a single act of economic
exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create
problems for you?

 YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed
in order toaddress such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint
licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to
achieve the "bundling of rights")

Yes, as it limits the innovation within EU. Because of that
often innovative products, which are potentiallybetter for
customers, are not introduced on the market. This leaves
customers with less attractive options of obtaining content.
Sometimes it even leaves customers with absolutely no option to
obtain content legally. Most notable examples are iTunes,
Spotify and (to some extent) YouTube service, whose
availability or functionality presented to the customers varies
between EU countries.

 NO

 NO OPINION

Linking and browsing

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one
location in theInternet to another. They are indispensable for
the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25

Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International)
and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).

in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the
public/making available to the public subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly
creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the
CJEU26

Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd).
See
alsohttp://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.

as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory
exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in
Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other
subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or
under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the rightholder?

 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the
case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Pleaseexplain whether you consider this to be the case
in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g.
because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by
a copyright exception)

Plainly said - no. A link to a document is fundamental building
block of Internet. Moreover, the link is NOT the content
itself. It is physically independent and retains absolutely no
information about the nature of linked document, let alone
linked document's contents. The linked content can be
absolutely anything, even completely unrelated to what a given
link suggests. Moreover, the content, the link points to, can
be changed at any time. Such change does not affect the link.
Currently, the rights holders have enough control over which of
their works are available online. The link on the other hand,
not being a work itself, must be out of control of the rights
holders. Anyone must be free to create links to whatever
content available online, without any restrictions and without
any control of rights holders or any 3rd parties involved. The
one who made a link or is storing it cannot be held responsible
for such action as he has absolutely no control over what
content that link leads to (or will lead to inthe future).

 NO OPINION

Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the
temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in the cachememory
of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?

 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the
case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case
in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g.
because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

Though technically viable, enablingit will: a) pose problems (if
not outright threat due to bugs and/or intentional loopholes in
technologies used) to the viewers (see case of such a measure
implemented by SONY on their audio CD-s
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal)
b) give rights holders technological means of control over who
watches what and using what technology. This is unacceptable.
Such solutions tend to be ineffective, dangerous and ultimately
more troublesome for legal customers than to those obtaining
materials from sources considered illegal. As any other
barriers, they ultimately discourage viewers/customers from
obtaining content through such protected (assumed to be legal)
channels. Moreover, due to the nature of technology used in
digital communication, such restrictive law would break the
Internet. Every time a user accesses content available online,
a copy present locally on user's computer is created. This step
cannot be avoided while retaining Internet's functionality.

Download to own digital content

Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital
transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the
possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this
manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The
principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in
the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a
tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the
right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that
tangible article)27

See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.

. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also
be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in
its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquiresthe
property of the copy)28

In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an
author cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence that
allows downloading his computer program from his website and
using it for an unlimited period of time.The exclusive right of
distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a
licence is exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus
admitted that the distribution right may be subject to
exhaustion in case of computer programs offered for download
with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer
Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule
constituted alex specialisin relation to the Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

. This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the
practical application of such an approach (how to avoid
re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have
“re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the “forward and
delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of
the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect
quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand
market for physical goods).

[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you faced
restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have
purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

 YES – Please explain by giving examples

This is the case with all software using Steam DRM. Any
programs, both purchasedonline and only in digital form in
Steam Store, operated by Valve Inc. and physical copies of
products. The license explicitly forbids resale of software
relying on this DRM, as any product is tied to a uniquely
identified customer.

 NO

 NO OPINION

[Inparticular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]
What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework
enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content?
Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.

[Open question]

Such legal framework covering ALL digital content is the only
logical extension of consumer rights already existing in the
non-digital world to a digital world. Any restrictions on
reselling of digital goods mean that some businesses present in
non-digitalworld are illegal/restricted in the digital world.

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good
idea?

Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as
the existing international treaties in the area prohibit
formalities as acondition for the protection and exercise of
rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute29

For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works
originating in the country imposing the formalities as opposed
to works originating in anothercountry.

. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and
exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with
the increased opportunities that digital technology provides
for the use of content (including older works and works that
otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and
disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being
considered30

On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on
certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible
online database is currently being set up by the Office for
Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the
registration of orphan works.

.

Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in
the identification and licensing of works and other subject
matter?

 YES

 NO

 NO OPINION

What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

[Open question]

The only possible advantage would be to have a single point with
access to EU-wide information about copyrighted works.

What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

[Open question]

However, such system must not be made compulsory, obligatory or
be enforced in any way. It shall be informative only. Otherwise
it will quickly transform itself into an EU-wide device of
oppression used for quenching creativity and will work contrary
to it's initial goal. To work properly, such a institution
mustbe explicitly denied any power to combat or assist in
combating copyright infringement. It's sole role must be to
gather and provide information.

What incentives for registration by rightholders could be
envisaged?

[Open question]

Definitely, thhe advantage for a rightholder would be more ease
of making potential customers aware of existence of his works
across all of EU Member States.

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

There are many private databases of works and other
subjectmatter held by producers, collective management
organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are
based to a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or
less) interoperable, internationally agreed ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a
work, are specific to the sector in which they have been
developed31

E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number
(ISBN) is used to identifybooks.

, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the
contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are
notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to
improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases.
The Global Repertoire Database32

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:http://www.globalrepertoiredatabase.com/.

should, once operational, provide a single sourceof information
on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33

You will find more information about this initiative (funded in
part by the European Commission) on the following website:
www.linkedcontentcoalition.org.

was established to develop building blocks for the expression
and management of rights and licensing across all content and
media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference
Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types of
rightsin all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:http://www.copyrighthub.co.uk/.

is seeking to take such identification systemsa step further,
and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing
across different sectors.

What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption
of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the
development and interoperabilityof rights ownership and
permissions databases?

[Open question]

If such a system were developed, it ought to have at least
following properties. It must be based on open standards not
related to any particular company/business (this includes
identifiers, rights ownership and data stored in permission
databases). Thus, it must be accessible by anyone interested,
free of charge. The system and it's contents must be
interoperable both across EU and outside. Such a system must
not be developed by, with or underinfluence of one side (i.e.
rights holders) only. The data being stored must be publicly
accessible by anyone, using machine readable interfaces, free
of charge.

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for
a limited period of time. After the term of protection has
expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national
rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention35

BerneConvention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works,http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.

requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the
death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of
protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram
producers, the term provided for in the EU rules also extend 20
years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first
publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual
sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate
in the digital environment?

 YES – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

Definitely not. Technological progress gave much easier access
to tools for creating content (both new and being a remix of
existing one). Thus emerged a new culture based on
threeprinciples: 1) creation of content by every member of
society, 2) casual sharing of content as part of everyday
communication between people and 3) widespread creation of new
works inspired by and taking from existing ones. All these
aspects make this culture model stand in direct opposition to
current laws. Current law strictly distinguishes creators of
content from it's consumers. This approach, stemming from time
when content creation required significant investments of
knowledge, skill, resources and money no longer applies to
current situation - a society of creators. Thus current strict
protection has numerous critical flaws. Most importantly,
current laws make virtually everyone a criminal, because
everyone (rightsholders including) will at some pointcreate a
work from the standpoint of law similar enough toexisting one
protected by copyright to make it an infringement
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Island_v_New_English_Teas).
It is the result of copyrights measured in decades, mostly
exceeding a century. This has to be discarded as ineffective,
counterproductive and curbing the creativity of EU citizens.
Such strict law also blocks access to significant portion of
cultural heritage when rights holders cannot be identified
(case of orphaned works). Future law must explicitly prevent
such absurd actions. It needs to focus almost exclusively on
protecting the right to be attributed as a creator. It must
define a very broad area of FREE, legitimate use in secondary
works/remixes and free, legitimate spreading of content. And
most certainly, future law must define upper caps on duration
of any copyright protection - definitely no longer than single
digit number of years (less than a decade).

Limitations and exceptions in the SingleMarket

Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights
enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter,
without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for
certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use
for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a
teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are
established in a number of copyright directives, most notably
Directive 2001/29/EC36

Plus Directive 96/9/ECon the legal protection of
databases;Directive 2009/24/ECon the legal protection of
computer programs,and Directive 92/100/ECon rental right and
lending right.

.

Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws
have to respect international law37

Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of the TRIPS
Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994;
Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty
(1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty(1996).

. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis
requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in
certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the
rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in
EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the
rights harmonised at EU level)38

Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor
importance for analogue uses existing in Member States at the
time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

, these limitations and exceptions are often optional39

With the exception of certain limitations: (i)in the Computer
Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii)
Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan
Works Directive.

, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in
national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish.
Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and
exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to
the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement
them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting
that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the
EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance
in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the
functioning of the Single Market.

In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the
rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the
territory of the Member State), the definition of the
limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so
an act that is covered by an exception in a MemberState "A"may
still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move
to the Member State "B")40

Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works
Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and related
rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or
cannot be located) has been given a cross-border effect, which
means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a
novel – is considered an orphan work in a Member State, that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member
States and can be used and accessed in all Member States.

.

The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also
raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In
some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or
exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are
not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the
books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a
Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify
which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being
raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and
Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an
exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation
of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and
Member Statesregulatory framework while ensuring the required
legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single
Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations
and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are
optional for the Member States?

 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

It means that an act that’s legal in one country could be
illegal elsewhere. For example, polish law enables sharing of
purchasedmaterials (i.e. movies, e-books) with family and
friends. However, such act is illegal in some other EU
countries. Also, it is in violation of licence agreements
imposed by shops and rights holders located abroad, where this
law does not apply. This ultimately harms businesses, creators
and customers by limiting their market choices. I personally
abstained from many such purchases because of that.

 NO – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so,
is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such
exceptions?

 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

Currently an act that’s legal in one country could beconsidered
illegal elsewhere, still within EU. This interferes with
freedom of transfers of goods, services and people (i.e. I may
decide to abstain from moving to one of EU countries due to the
risk of facing legal action).Therefore, such rules need to be
mandatory, provided they will be used to make copyright law
much less restrictive. Further restrictions will only make the
situation worse.

 NO – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed
from the existing catalogue?Please explain by referring to
specific cases.

[Open question]

Current law proved to be way too rigid and restrictive. At the
VERY least sharing of content and creation of new content off
of existing works for non-commercial purposes is necessary.
Further restrictions will only harm EU by penalizing most
creative citizens. It will even threaten innovation in EU.
Potential customers will refrain from purchasing innovative
goods/using innovative services to avoid threat of legal
actions. Businesses will likely abstain from
developing/releasing such products for the very same reasons
and because of lack of interest of potential customers.

Independently from thequestions above, is there a need to
provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU
regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

 YES – Please explain why

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain why

Such approach will not deal with the existing problems of
digital borders and activities legal in one country being
illegal in another. The only possible scenario would be to
switch from "copyright everything unless it falls under a
specific exception" approach to "copyright nothing unless it
falls under a VERY specific, VERY limited, narrow, precisely
defined exception limited to content generating businesses
only; not referring to citizens and their activities" approach.

 NO OPINION

Ifyes, what would be the best approach to provide for
flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the
ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by
the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a
fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please
explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible
effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]

Switch from "copyright everything unless it falls under a
specific exception" approach to "copyright nothing unless it

experience, constitute a problem?

In the event that limitations and exceptions established at
national level were to have cross-border effect, how should
thequestion of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such
compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom,
where?)

[Open question]

Current concept of 'fair compensation' is incompatible with
modern world, with how people find, consume and spreadknowledge
of content. There's even evidence that use of work without
compensation can result later in much greater compensation for
the creator. People usually accused of denying creators their
'fair compensation' are in fact the best customers (yes,

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their
national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the
benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If
implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and
archiving41

Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.

and enable on-site consultation of the works and other
subjectmatter in the collections of suchinstitutions42

Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.

. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these
establishments of physical copies of works and other subject
matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43

Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.

.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to
achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be
clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the
same time, questions arise as to the effect of such apossible
expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject
matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders.
The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between
different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving

The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter
held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,
records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of works,
the copying of fragile works - mayinvolve the creation of
another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most
Member States provide for an exception in their national laws
allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope
of the exception differs from Member State toMember State (as
regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of
works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of
copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary
establishment may make). Also, the current legal status ofnew
types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving
publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation
of works and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book,
watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on thepremises
of such establishments for the purpose of research and private
study. The online consultation of works and other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is
generally addressed in agreements between
universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law
rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to,
and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

(a)[In particular if you are an institutional user:]Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate
agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide
remote access, including across borders, to your collections
(or parts thereof) for purposes of research and privatestudy?

[Open question]

Current law makes it next to impossible to access collections of
institutions such as universities and national libraries when
you are not on thepremises of the institutions in question.
This could be achieved by digitalization and on-line access. It
is however subject to current, rigid and outdated copyright
laws. A positive example (though outside EU) is Australian War
Memorial (http://www.awm.gov.au).

Only removal of limitations to digitalization and on-line access
can solve this problem. Such limitations harm me both as a
creator and as a customer.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physicalcopies of
works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users.
Recent technological developments have made it technically
possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access
to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via
networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such
e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and
libraries are currently experimenting with different business
models for the making available of works online, including
direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling
by aggregators.

(a)[In particular if you are alibrary:]Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable
the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of
books or other materials held in your collection?

(b)[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you

other materials electronically (e-lending), including across

(c)[In particular if you are aright holder:]Have you negotiated

materials electronically, including across borders?

 YES – Please explain with specific examples

Due to current laws, even if such options exist, they are very
rare and subject to many limitations discouraging me as a
customer from e-lending. Especially that collecting
societiesdemonize e-lending in media by depicting it as yet
another activity that ought to be illegal but by some fluke
isn't yet and leads to reduced incomes of artists (that is-
collecting societies).

 NO

 NO OPINION

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

1. By creating one EU-wide law ascertaining the unconditional
right to e-lending. 2. By ascertaining that all e-book titles
available forsale to the public should be available to
libraries for acquisition and be accessed as soon as they are
published. 3. By making it compulsory to publish e-books in
interoperable, DRM-free formats

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n°
3) and the previous one (n° 2).

differences do you see in the management of physical and online

[Open question]

From a rightholder's perspective current restrictive laws
prevent me from presenting my works to widest audience
possible. Thus these laws reduce the awareness of existence of
my works. These laws ultimately harm me both as a creator and
as a consumer.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to
efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to
digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their
collectionswith an objective to preserve these collections and,
normally, to make them available to the public. Examples are
efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of
the 20thcentury or whole collections of pictures of historical
value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by
the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on
the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works
(i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of
commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of
licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural
institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies
representingauthors and publishers onthe other44

You will find more information about his MoU on the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm.

. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found only in the
archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available onlineto everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary
licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on the
basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers).
Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the
largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing
in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting
society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the
licences granted)45

France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the
effectsof the MoU.The French act (LOI n° 2012-287 du 1er mars
2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres
indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees collective management,
unless the author or publisher in question opposes such
management.The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und
vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des
Urheberrechtsgesetzes vom 1.Oktober 2013) contains a legal
presumption of representation by a collecting society in
relation to works whose rightholders are not members ofthe

 YES – Please explain

For me as a user and EU citizen it is in my utmost interest to
have free, unrestricted access to all types of cultural
content. And online access is currently the best solution.
There is no valid reason to limiting access online in any way
(i.e. only to certain types of content). Future EU law shall
explicitly forbid any limitations of access to any type of
content. For me as a rights holder and EU citizen it is in my
utmost interest to let others have unrestricted access to
content created by me. Online access is currently the best
solution. There is no valid reason to limiting access in any
way (i.e. only to certain types of content). Future EU law
shall explicitly forbid any limitations of access to any type

Teaching

Directive 2001/29/EC46

Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for
non-commercial teaching.Such exceptions would typically allow a
teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of
newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected
content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation
from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional)
provision allows for rather different implementation at Member
States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States
providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for
certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and
study at home.

(a)[In particular if you are an enduser/consumer or an
institutional user:]Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to use works or other subject-matter for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?

(b)[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you
experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which
works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?

 YES – Please explain

Use of copyrighted works for educational purposes is crucial in
providing access to knowledge for EU citizens. Such uses shall
not require a licence, though compensation should be allowed.
This shall result in cheaper teaching materials and better
education all over EU, and, ultimately in growth of market for
culture.

 NO OPINION

Ifthere are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

Use of copyrighted works for educational purposes is crucial in
providing access to knowledge for EU citizens. Such uses should
not require a license, though compensation should be allowed.
This should be mandatory for all EU member states.

What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use
of content for illustration for teaching purposes? How
successful are they?

[Open question]

Such mechanisms make education more expensive and less effective
by blocking access to valuable material when no license
agreement was reached. Also, because of monopolistic position
of collecting societies, the prices are not regulated by free
market competition.

If your view is that alegislative solution is needed, what would
be its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary
institutions should be covered and under what conditions?

[Open question]

Use of copyrighted works for educational purposes is crucial in
providing accessto knowledge for EU citizens. Such uses should
not be subject to restriction or any other
limiting/time-consuming means. Such use should not require a
license, though compensation (not necessarily monetary) should
be allowed and encouraged.

If your viewis that a different solution is needed, what would
it be?

[Open question]

Use of copyrighted works for educational purposes is crucial in
providing access to knowledge for EU citizens. Such uses should
not be subject to restriction or any other
limiting/time-consuming means. Such approach must be made
mandatory for all EU countries.

Research

Directive 2001/29/EC47

Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial
scientific research. The open formulation of this (optional)
provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

(a)[In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an

 NO

 NO OPINION

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

ALL (be it legal, physical, software or any other)methods of
preventing customers from disposing any content they purchased

of content for research purposes? How successful are they?

[Open question]

There are no such mechanisms to my knowledge.

Disabilities

Directive 2001/29/EC48

Article 5 (3)b of Directive 2001/29.

provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people
with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional)
provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other
subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by
increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union)49

The European TrustedIntermediaries Network (ETIN) resulting from
a Memorandum of Understanding between representatives of the
right-holder community (publishers, authors, collecting
societies) and interested parties such as associations for
blind and dyslexic persons

The Marrakesh Treaty50

Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by
Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities,
Marrakesh, June 17 to 28 2013.

has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for
persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright
that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute
and make available accessible format copies to visually
impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders.
The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and
ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain
provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

(a)[In particular if you are a person with a disability or an
organisation representing persons with disabilities:]Have you
experienced problems with accessibility to content, including
across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of
this exception?

(b)[In particular if you are an organisation providing services
for persons with disabilities:]Have you experienced problems
when distributing/communicating works published in special
formats across the EU?

(c)[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you
experienced specific problems resulting from the application of
limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special
formats, including across borders?

 YES – Please explain by giving examples

If particular content can be made available for disabled
audience (i.e. by adding subtitles for deaf people to a movie),
even if there exist both a validtechnology a party willing to do
it (sometimes even free of charge!), they cannot do it without
first obtaining approval of rights holder, as it is seen as an
infringing intervention in a copyrighted work. For a creator of
work this means that law is arbitrarily excluding some of
potential viewers from accessing the work.

 NO

 NO OPINION

If there are problems, what could be done to improve
accessibility?

[Open question]

Radical easing of copyright laws will result in less legal
doubts and more innovative solutions that aren't even
considered now, under current, very restrictive law.

What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate
accessibility to content? How successful are they?

[Open question]

There are no such mechanisms to my knowledge.Moreover, current
copyright laws work against anyone attempting to deal with
these problems using new technologies.

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51

For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and
datamining” will be used.

are different terms used to describe increasingly important
techniques used in particular by researchers for the
exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g.,
journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
ofsoftware or other automated processes, an analysis is made of
relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights,
patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible
on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g.
journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g.
on browser cache memories orin computers RAM memories or onto
the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis.
Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or
other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation
from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to
general public without restrictions on the internet, open
access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are
covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of
Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining
activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None
of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does
not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in
several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whetherthe main problems arising in relation to this issue go
beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain
the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need
to obtain “access” to content (i.e. being able to use e.g.
commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same
time,practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of
subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52

See the document “Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

. In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued
that no additional licences should be required to mine material
to which access has been provided through a subscription
agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and
data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basisof
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can
copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial
cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called
“user-generated content”. While users can create totally
original content, they can also take one or several
pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload
the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs53

A typicalexample could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video
(adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound recording), or
adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other
examples are “mash-ups” (blending two sound recordings), and
reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in
a blog.

. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification
of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results
from merely adding,subtracting or associating some pre-existing
content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity
is not “new” as such. However, the development of social
networking and social media sites that enable users to share
content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities
and increased the potential economic impact for those holding
rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the
preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With
the possibilities offered by the newtechnologies, re-use is
open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with
regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and
the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results or even the
definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were
presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One
view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in
particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as
combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of
photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is
needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between
rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded
between rightholders and the users generating the content. In
any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content
and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by
rightholders across different sectors as a result of the
“Licences for Europe” discussions54

Privatecopying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their
national legislation exceptions or limitations to the
reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55

Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods
typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording
equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such
as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made
without their authorisation by certain categories of persons
(i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or
through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that
context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the
question arises as to whether the copying of files by
consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g.
when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to
storemultiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the
application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in
some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders
whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider
already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could
potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies
could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees56

Europe", COM(2012) 529 final.

 NO – Please explain

Issue of creation of digital copies was answered in question 64.
There must be no additional fees imposed on a customer that
legally purchased (paid for) content (including access to
content as a service). Practice described in the question must
be made illegal as it enables rights holders to charge
customers multiple times for products already purchased and
paid for. Moreover, such limiting mechanisms fall into a
category of DRM and should be banned.

 NO OPINION

How would changes in levies with respect to the application to
online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing
allowing, for instance, users to havecopies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business
models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]

Practice of pre-emptive, compulsory payment as a remedy for
'theoretical', 'possible' futureinfringements must be made
illegal as it contradicts the foundation of jurisdiction that
the defendant is innocent until proven guilty. Thinking that if
the technology may be used for copyright infringement it will
surely be and that the amount can be measured is a fallacy.
Thus such payments are in fact state-enforced taxes for private
enterprises.

Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the
invoices for products subject to levies?60

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply
different tariffs. This resultsin obstacles to the free
circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the
same time, many Member States continue to allow the
indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all
transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product
subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In
that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption
and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these
situations and reduce the number of undue payments61

This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr
Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private

If you have identified specificproblems with the current
functioning of the levy system, how would these problems best
be solved?

[Open question]

The main problem is the legal power of institutions (i.e. ZAiKS,
Kopipol in Poland, GEMA in Germany), that are supposed to gather
and transfer levies, and their activity. Such institutions share
only a fraction of what they gather with the creators (and not
with all of them, as a prominent example of Piotr Waglowski
shows (thorough article: http://prawo.vagla.pl/node/7274 (in
Polish)) ) and useof methods up to misinformation (case of
ZAiKS and music licensed under Creative Commons
(http://di.com.pl/news/18210.html (article in Polish)) and
legal threats to expand their power and increase income. These
monopolies must be overthrown and power of possible future
intermediaries between creators and consumers must be very
limited. Even if in future the model of collecting societies
will be implemented, there must be a clear legislation
preventing any attempts to create monopolies by such
institutions.Creators must have freedom of choice as to which
collecting society to choose (or to choose no collecting
society as their representative altogether). Such societies
cannot be in any way funded by states or EU as this will surely
lead to situations when these institutions will spend more money
than they receive from claiming due royalties.

Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a
number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose
performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There
are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing
thetransferof rights fromauthors or performers to producers62

See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

or determining who theowner of the rights is when the work or
other subject matter is created in the context of an employment
contract63

See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive
96/9/EC.

. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member
Statesto regulate and there are significant differences in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist
between different sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are
not adequatelyremunerated, in particular but not solely, as
regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared
along the whole value chain. Another commonly raised issue
concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders
are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice
to improve their situation and that action at EU level is
necessary.

[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you
receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your
works and performances?

[Open question]

In current era of mass-produced content the best approach is to
limit the remuneration to absolute minimum (i.e. live shows and
other physically distinguishable creations carrying added value
besides their content that is replicable in a digital form).Law
shall move away from current model focusing on obligatory
remuneration when not otherwise stated. Current mechanism does
not protect creators but rather collecting societies and other
copyright monopolies uninvolved in creation of content.

Is therea need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?

 YES – Please explain

At the very least clauses that prevent customers/users from
their basic rights need to be made illegal. This covers clauses
introducing any (i.e. legal, technological, software) methods of
denying customers free and unrestricted disposition of purchased
goods (methods also known as DRM; this includes clauses limiting
the number of uses); clauses imposing any payments to remedy for
'possible' future copyright infringements; clauses denying reuse
of purchased/licensed content in secondary, non-commercial
works; clauses enabling the seller/granter one-sided removal,
destruction, revoking of access to digital product or revoking
of rights to the use ofproduct to the customer/grantee.

 NO – Please explain why

If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what
would you suggest to address theshortcomings you identify?

[Open question]

Make copyright-related restrictions as limited as possible; on
the contrary to the current trend of extending and broadening
copyright laws.

Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE64

Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual
property rights.

provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related
rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this text65

You will find more information on the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm

. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions
are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the
digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be
insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
thedissemination of digital content on the internet; on the
other hand, there are concerns about the current balance
between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life
and data protection. While it cannot be contested that
enforcement measures should always be available in case of
infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is
used for a commercial purpose66

For examplewhen the infringing content is offered on a website
which gets advertising revenues that depend on the volume of
traffic.

. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of
intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67

This clarification should not affectthe liability regime of
intermediary service providers established by Directive
2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

. At the same time, there could be clarification of the
safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for
private users.

Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more
efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a
commercial purpose?

 YES – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain

On the contrary. IPR enforcement is sadly one of very few
examples of sanctions disproportionately harsher when compared
to the act itself. It reached the level of absurd where life of
a citizen(in terms of both punishment a violator may face and
the resources invested in enforcing the law) is cheaper than
infringement of copyright. This raises legitimate objections to
the validity of such a strict enforcement of copyright laws.

 NO OPINION

Inparticular, is the current legal framework clear enough to
allow for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as
Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment
service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If
not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?

[Open question]

Intermediaries, as the word implies, are merely providers of
connections between subjects. Whatever is being transmitted is
and has to be of no concern for intermediaries. Any actions to
encourage/enforce involvement of intermediaries in combating
online copyright infringements should be made illegal, as such
actions abuse right to privacy and freedom of speech amongst
many civil liberties.

Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the
right balance is achieved between the right to have one’s
copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of
private life and protection of personal data?

 YES – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain

No. Not only is the current law utterly skewed towards rights
holders. It is in stark contradiction with users' rights stated
elsewhere within EU law. Moreover, current law is in direct
opposition to Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European
Union, amongst other documents stating civil liberties. More
specifically, current law enables advocates of copyright
maximalism to justify mass abuse of citizens' rights, i.e.
right to privacy, right to fair trial, freedom of speech.
Finally, current law is not even protecting the creators of
currently copyrighted material, who are forced to transfer
their rights to 3rd party rights holders (Collecting Societies)
and denied right to due compensation. In short, current law is
exclusively protecting the rights of monopolistic institutions
that are not involved in any form of creative and/or innovative
activities and only work against it as it posesdirect threat to
their monopolistic position. On a side-note, such a strong
enforcement creates dangerous precedents used to legitimize
other abuses of various rights of EU citizens.

 NO OPINION

A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing aunified EU Copyright Title has been
present in the copyright debate for quite some time now,
although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would
totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and
replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the
only manner in which a truly Single Market for content
protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe
that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing
a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal
systems.

Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright
Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for
rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a
single framework for enforcement?

 YES

 NO

 NO OPINION

Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in
the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member
State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive
consultation on the most important matters relating to the
current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could
bring them to our attention, so they can be properly addressed
in the future.

Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal
framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such
matters should be addressed.

[Open question]

One such issue is the level of influence rights holders have,
primarily thanks to lack of transparency, on legislative
process, when compared with customers and users. Most striking
examplesare negotiations of Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement
(ACTA), Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)
and most notably, though luckily outside EU, Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP). Any attempts to negotiate such agreements
(until now exclusively aimed at maximization of Intellectual
Property-related laws) without proper level of transparency and
without participation of all stakeholders shall be automatically
dropped on EU level. EU shall also implement an EU-wide ban on
participation in anysuch negotiations by any Member State.
Additionally any attempts to negotiate any agreements, not only
related to copyright laws, with disregard of democratic
procedures shall be banned. The whole procedure of negotiating
of any agreement (not only copyright-related) must be
transparent.

Another issue, though pointed out earlier, is the amount of
resources aimed at combating copyright infringements, both
online (i.e. HADOPI law
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HADOPI_law) and offline.
Practices like these presented in HADOPI law must be made
illegal. Also, any attempts to block any users, websites
(domains), IP-s or larger parts of the Internet by court
orders, both copyright infringement-related and not, shall be
banned as ineffective, disruptive for the infrastructure and
being against civil liberties, most importantly - freedom of
speech. The same mechanisms can be and, as the practice shows,
are used as tools of censorship. This makes EU
indistinguishablefrom regimes condemned by the very same EU for
censorship and other acts of curbing of civil liberties.

Next problem is the very dangerous practice of extralegal,
voluntary regulations between ISPs, related to combating online
copyright infringements, usually by blocking certain websites or
monitoring users' activity online. Regardless of reason and
parties involved, such practices shall be treated similarly to
price fixing - in other words, they shall be banned and parties
involved shall be subject to legal action. Such agreements
result in customers having limited choice on the market and
receiving services of inferior quality (not mentioning the
abuse of users' civil liberties). Therefore even suggesting
such agreements or self-regulations resulting in unlawful
actions against customers needs to be thwarted within EU.

This is directly related to another type of activity by rights
holders that needs to be addressed and stopped. It is the
privileged position of representatives of rights holders on
various law enforcement activities related to
copyrightinfringement. Among others it covers participation in
searches
(http://www.wprost.pl/ar/134008/Policja-Billa-Gatesa/?I=1334
(article in Polish)), privileged access to internal
trial-related materials during trial (as consultants/experts
and, at the same time, as defendants). In Poland it is also a
common practice to gratify law enforcement organs for their
copyright infringement-related activities, regardless of
outcome of trials and legitimacy of charges (yearly reward of
'Złota Blacha'
http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koalicja_Antypiracka (article in
Polish)) Another issue that needs to be addressed is the
intentional disinformation about the users' rights and
obligations related to copyright by rights holders
(http://m.wyborcza.pl/wyborcza/1,105226,13112726,ZPAV_ostro_o_kampanii_spolecznej__Prawo_kultury__.html
(article in Polish)), influence of what current law sees as
copyright infringement and it's influence on the market
(http://torrentfreak.com/pirates-are-the-music-industrys-most-valuable-customers-100122/
(music - 2009 report by Jupiter research for IFPI),
http://www.heise.de/tp/blogs/6/150152 (video - 2011 report by
Gesellschaft für Konsumforschung, article in German)), validity
of their arguments:
(http://www.ibtimes.com/critics-say-mpaa-riaa-should-stop-lying-about-piracy-loss-shutting-down-demonoid-pirate-bay-850179
- this also shows how inefficient such institutions are and how
much of artists' money they lose) or even the misuse of certain
words, phrases and terms, like 'piracy' or theft'.

Next bigproblem is related to the use of more and more popular
technology of 3d-printing. As the case of takedown of designs
by Thomas Valenty on the request from UK based Games Workshop
(http://www.wired.com/design/2012/05/3-d-printing-patent-law)
shows, the lawneeds to be clarified and made more liberal to
protect citizens from legal actions by companies using
uncertainties, loopholes and overly broad interpretations of
obviously outdated law.

Practices of businesses like Smashwords shop
(https://www.smashwords.com) need to be addressed. Licence
agreements of digital content (books) purchased there are in
direct violation of polish copyright law. The solution would be
to implement the concept of 'fair use' (most importantly the
'right to share with family and friends' and the 'right to
download') from polish legislation in the whole of EU.
Secondly, it should be made a law that if any part of a
particular licence contradicts EU law in a way that it imposes
stronger restrictions on customer’s rights, such restrictions
should not apply.

Another example that the copyright related laws are faulty,
misused and need to be both loosened and clarified is another
case involving previously mentioned UK based company Games
Workshop. Completely unreasonable and unfounded claim against
M.C.A Hogarth
(https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/trademark-bully-thwarted-spots-space-marine-back-online)
wasn't resolved before coordinated action of several advocacy
groups of people stepped id. Had they not acted in the case,
were it instantly lost by said independent writer. This case
shows also that currently implemented mechanisms of identifying
copyrighted items and resolving any copyright-related disputes
are inefficient and harmful to the rights holders themselves.
Strict limitationof the copyright itself, what can be
copyright-protected and what can even be legally disputed is
necessary to protect the rights holders from what can only be
called 'legal bullying' and to avoid succumbing in lack of
creativity by EU citizens.

Currentcopyright law is used to more and more extent by various
businesses for thwarting market competitors, instead of
protecting the creators; and for seizing the public sphere at
the cost of civil liberties. Prime example is London Olympic
Games in 2012, wherethe rights holder was able to acclaim
exceptional, unheard-of earlier power unbelievable to any
advocate of free market under the guise of protection of
copyright. Among other things the rights holder was able to
arbitrarily choose which companies were entitled to participate
in this market segment by offering their goods associated with
the event (from the big, multi-national corporations to even
the smallest of businesses). Even the citizens fell victim to
this unprecedented crackdown of freedom of business; to the
level of denying them dignity and freedom of expression. And
speaking of citizens, their rights as authors, creators and
customers were abused by denying them the freedom of what
(legally obtained) equipment can be used to record the events
andwhat can be done with private recordings (effectively
turning the rights holder of the London Olympic Games in 2012
into both a rights holder of all content created during the
event and, more importantly, a censor, usually associated with
totalitarian regimes). To make things worse, an extremely
dangerous precedent of copyrighting mundane words, phrases and
even dates was set. More information available here:
http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/13/olympics-2012-branding-police-sponsors.
Another example is UEFA EURO 2012 that took place in Poland and
Ukraine. During the event similar abuse gused as copyright
protection took place. Citizens' rights as authors, creators
were abused by denying them the freedom of what (legally
obtained) equipment can be used to record the events and what
can be done with private recordings. Moreover, citizens' rights
as customers were abused by denying them the freedom of choice,
what products to buy. Moreover, something as basic as a choice
whether to buy any products from suppliers chosen by rights
holder or bring products purchased elsewhere was denied (more
information in local media:
http://www.gazetawroclawska.pl/artykul/591217,stadion-miejski-jak-wejsc-co-nam-wolno-co-jest-zakazane,id,t.html
(in Polish)). Such blatant violations of free and unrestricted
market within EU and customers' freedom of choice (regardless
of such regulations being put into place in the name of
protecting rights holders or not) must be addressed and stopped
once and for all. Such unprecedentedviolations of EU citizens'
rights (both as humans and as rights holders) (regardless of
such regulations being put into place in the name of protecting
rights holders or not) must be addressed and stopped.
