The Organization for Transformative Works (OTW) is a nonprofit organization established in
2007 to promote the acceptance of noncommercial fanworks as legitimate creative works, to
preserve the history of fan culture, and to protect and defend fanworks from commercial
exploitation and legal challenge. “Fanworks” are new, noncommercial creative works based on
existing media; outside media fandom, the term “remix” is often used. As of January 1, 2014,
nearly 18 % of the OTW’s financial supporters come from Member States: our donors come
from Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

Like other large online sites, both our authors and our audiences are global. Our archive of
transformative, noncommercial works hosts roughly one million works of authorship, a number
growing by hundreds of thousands per year. As of late 2013, roughly 26% of unique visits—
approximately 12.8 million visits per week—come from individuals in Member States. On
average, over 2600 people in Member States are using the archive at any given minute, around
20% of them from the United Kingdom, and the rest distributed throughout the Member States
in smaller percentages. As a result, the OTW has a substantial interest in uniform exceptions
and limitations that protect the ability of individuals to create noncommercial, transformative
works.

Our members and users are usually spoken of as “consumers,” but they are also creators.
Because of the heterogenous interests we represent, we have checked multiple boxes for “type of
respondent.”

One of the OTW’s projects is a free, nonprofit website hosting transformative noncommercial
works, the Archive of Our Own. The Archive has over 200,000 registered users, but registration
is not required to participate on the site, nor is membership in the OTW. The Archive receives
over 49.5 million unique visits per week.

     I.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
    13.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
    provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
      YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
    As presently constituted, the variety of national laws makes it extremely difficult to aid our
    users or other transformative authors seeking guidance about what they may or may not do,
    even when their works are plainly both creative and noncommercial. The lack of uniformity
    with respect to ‘user-generated content’/remix in particular hinders the development of the
    internal market, especially online. 1
    Extensive research and experience demonstrates that the creation of noncommercial works
    based on existing works has profound benefits for individuals and for creative communities.
    Artists have always learned by both copying and altering existing art, and this practice
    continues in the modern world. Empirically, creating noncommercial transformative works
    motivates people—especially young people—to learn new languages; improve their skills in
    their native languages; learn artistic techniques; learn video editing; learn other 21st-century
    skills; and develop a respect both for intellectual property law and its legitimate limits. 2 The
    techniques of remix are valuable educational tools both inside and outside of formal
    educational settings, implicating individuals’ rights to education. To these skills must be added
    the valuable critical content of the transformative works themselves, which offer new
    perspectives and meanings. Remix is particularly useful and attractive to members of
    subordinated groups, who regularly use it to challenge dominant narratives. 3
    By its very independence from the incentives of formal markets, noncommerciality signals the
    presence of expression tied to a creator’s personhood, which deserves special consideration and
    sensitivity to free expression concerns (and also raises consumer protection issues, as
    individuals react to works they have been invited to experience). Currently, consumers are
    often unable to make reasonable uses of parts of existing works to further their own self-
    expressive purposes with any legal certainty. However, these creative uses are in practice
    widespread, because it is so natural and intuitive that noncommercial, creative uses should be
    legitimate; the result is that consumers are vulnerable to enforcement efforts that seem to come
    at random or, worse, are exercised when a consumer is making a legitimate criticism of a
    copyrighted work. The rights of consumers to express themselves and copyright owners are
    out of balance, and internal harmonization could improve the balance.

    14.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
    a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
      YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
    Given the      necessarily international scope of online uses—where noncommercial
    transformative works are most prevalent, because the technology readily supports making
    works freely available—there is a great need for harmonization of exceptions and limitations.

    15.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
    catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
    There is a great need for an exemption that would protect transformative works, particularly
    noncommercial, transformative works. Either a flexible exemption of broader scope that
    covered transformative uses or a specific exemption for noncommercial, transformative works
    could provide the necessary certainty for internet-based communities of authors and audiences.
    Communities of transformative creators, such as Harry Potter fans who make “wizard rock” or
    engage in political activism, routinely cross international borders and need more uniform
    protections. 4

    Making this type of exception mandatory furthers the interests of both users and future
    creators, and at the same time helps to foster expressions of culture within the EU. This
    scenario, in turn, complies with the integration clauses of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
    European Union (TFEU), particularly arts. 12, 167(4) and 169(2), which mandate the EU to
    take into account cultural aspects and consumer protection in EU legislation.

    16. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
    degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
      YES – Please explain why
    In the internet age, it has become plain that innovation—both technological and artistic—
    comes from multiple sources, often unanticipated. A closed list of narrow limitations and
    exceptions is inherently unable to accommodate reasonable but unanticipated uses. (This is
    particularly true with respect to noncommercial activities, whose participants generally lack
    legal advice and can be inadvertently suppressed by measures aimed at commercial activities. 5)
    It is for this reason that many nations around the world are considering measures to improve
    flexibility, including most recently the Australian Law Reform Commission’s recommendation
    that Australia adopt a flexible fair use exemption, which it determined was consistent with
    national interests and international obligations. 6 As the ALRC explained, flexibility has
    numerous benefits, and its alleged uncertainties should not inhibit its adoption: “The standard
    recommended by the ALRC is not novel or untested. Fair use builds on Australia’s fair dealing
    exceptions, it has been applied in US courts for decades, and it is built on common law
    copyright principles that date back to the eighteenth century. If fair use is uncertain, this does
    not seem to have greatly inhibited the creation of films, music, books and other material in the
    world’s largest exporter of cultural goods, the United States.” 7
    By contrast, currently, copyright owners’ rights in the EU are, in effect, fully harmonized at a
    high level, while in the field of exceptions the 2001 INFOSOC Directive stopped well sort of
    harmonization, on the one hand, and imposed significant limits on the abilility of member
    states to adopt open, flexible exceptions on the other. The result is that rights are out of
    balance with exeptions in the EU – and this imbalance threatens the future of cultural
    production in the EU.

    17.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
    by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
    Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
    open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
    disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
    Internal Market.
    As noted above, the primary advantage of a flexible exception is that it would be able to
    accommodate unanticipated uses that were nonetheless similar in spirit and effect to existing
    excepted uses. This would provide built-in protection and help establish a functioning internal
    market for copyright goods and services (provided that such exception is made mandatory, as
    suggested above). This flexibility can be obtained while also honoring existing international
    commitments. 8 Although an exception limited to noncommercial transformative uses would not
    have the same positive economic significance, it would nevertheless make a significant indirect
    contribution to the development of the EU creative sector.

    18.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
    a problem?
      YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
    Some noncommercial, transformative uses may qualify for particular national limitations
    protecting commentary, criticism, and other forms of response to existing works, including
    quotation rights. However, the lack of uniformity means that creators online have minimal
    certainty, because their works are available everywhere. For noncommercial works, online
    distribution is usually the only option, but it exposes creators to multiple, potentially
    conflicting regimes.


    19.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
    have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
    when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
    For noncommercial transformative works, from which the creator by definition neither expects
    nor receives profit, there should be no required payment; the OTW has no opinion on
    appropriate payment schemes in other instances.

    F. User-generated content
    40.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
    when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
    the Internet, including across borders?

    YES: As explained above, creators in Member States are vulnerable to suppression in many
    ways. Communities, whether formal or informal, cannot take advantage of the benefits of
    remix cultures without threats of suppression. For example, the OTW has recently dealt with
    several copyright owners who claimed the right to suppress noncommercial, transformative
    works of fan fiction. In the US, we have been able to protect noncommercial creators because
    of the broad scope of fair use law.

    Licensing does not and will not offer a plausible solution, because the organic,
    noncommercial communities that create transformative remixes cannot be moved into the
    commercial sector without being fundamentally altered and diminished. 9 The market changes
    what it swallows. The evidence indicates that noncommercial production in a digital
    economy is not just detached from monetary exchange. It can be subject to crowding out—
    noncommercial motives can be eliminated when money is on offer, leading to less overall
    creativity and less social benefit. 10

    People who can pay to participate in licensing schemes are less likely to be young, relatively
    poor, female, or otherwise part of culturally devalued groups, since cultural and economic
    power are often related.       The experience of American hip-hop shows a decline of
    experimental and political art as the industry converted to an always-license model. 11
    Copyright’s incentivizing virtues come with costs, and so we should protect diverse sources of
    support for creativity—including voluntary expression, distinct from the sphere of market
    exchange.

    Even aside from the special role of noncommerciality in shaping communities and the content
    of transformative works, there are two key reasons that voluntary licensing schemes cannot

motivations because they (a) impair self-determination—that is, a person feels pressured by an external force,
and therefore feels overjustified in maintaining her intrinsic motivation rather than complying with the will of the
source of the extrinsic reward; or (b) impair self-esteem—they cause an individual to feel that his internal
motivation is rejected, not valued, leading him to reduce his self-esteem and thus to reduce effort.”); Bruno S.

 substitute for protection for noncommercial, transformative works. First, licenses will never
 be comprehensive, leaving many remix creators out in the cold, especially noncommercial
 users. 12 It is notable, for example, that even the extremely vague and general promises
 regarding ‘user-generated content’ in the ‘Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring more
 content online’ 13 covered only a tiny fraction of the creative industries, whereas remix
 cultures regularly bring in text, audio, video, and visual arts. Second, licenses will always
 retain censorship rights, thus always leaving creators of transformative noncommercial works
 at risk of suppression—and the works that will be suppressed are precisely those that are most
 expressive, critical, and necessary. 14 The experience of Jonathan McIntosh, who created a
 remix that criticized the Twilight series for its regressive gender stereotypes, shows that
 copyright owners will attempt to use licenses to prevent criticism—and his case is only
 unusual because he managed to get publicity and legal representation to establish that he was
 protected by the U.S. fair use doctrine. 15

 Finally, licensing models are anti-competitive. Individual users have neither the knowledge
 nor the ability to negotiate licenses. Instead, licensing schemes presuppose that some larger
 entity will negotiate with rightsholders. YouTube’s Content ID, often identified as a model for
 licensing, is a system put in place by a currently dominant market participant, as is Amazon’s
 Kindle Worlds (which allows some highly limited, commercial use of several existing media
 properties). But we do not know what markets will look like in ten years. Neither the Kindle
 nor YouTube have yet been around for a decade. To conclude that current intermediaries
 have solved the problem of licensing poses significant risks on both sides—on the one hand,
 the licensing model risks entrenching YouTube’s and Amazon’s near-monopolies on the
 market because other competitors don’t have access to the same licensed content; 16 on the
 other, if the market changes and either entity goes the way of AOL’s walled garden,
 Blackberry, MySpace, Alta Vista, and many other formerly dominant digital entities, their
 licensing “solutions” will disappear with them.

  (b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users
 that are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-
 existing works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?

     YES (b)– Please explain
 The Archive of Our Own provides creators with a textual (tag-based) architecture to identify
 the works on which their fanworks are based. When uploading a new work, creators identify
 the relevant fandom or fandoms, to ensure proper attribution.

 schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of
 pre-existing works) through your service?

     NO (b)– Please explain
 As a purely noncommercial, nonprofit service, the Archive of Our Own does not allow
 commercial activity, including remuneration schemes, because of the detrimental effects
 commercialization would have on fan activities. The OTW notes that ‘adequate’ remuneration
 is a relative term, taking into account competing rights and social aims; this constraint is
 particularly important when transformative uses are noncommercial and thus not motivated by
 any attempt to seek profit but rather by self-expressive aims.

 43.      If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 As noted above, protection for noncommercial transformative works would avoid the
 difficulties posed by inevitably futile attempts at pervasive licensing, and would allow
 commercial industries to focus on wholesale copying and unauthorized, illegitimate commercial
 uses that compete for revenue.


 44.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
 elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
 As noted above, the OTW supports legal protection for transformative works, particularly
 noncommercial transformative works. A flexible exception could provide the necessary
 protection. In the alternative, a clearly and relatively categorical noncommercial transformative
 works exception could also address the issues faced by noncommercial artists. 17
