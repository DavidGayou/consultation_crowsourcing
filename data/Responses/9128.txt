     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" 1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework 23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now 4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions 5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy" 6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works" 7 and "Content Online" 8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

Europe’s copyright regime in many different ways. Our members hold rights in highly
valuable works, including software essential to productivity, systems management,
database, design and Internet connectivity, and rely on revenues from the licensing of those
works to fund their innovation. At the same time, our members also provide many of the
world’s leading online services and solutions for the creation, delivery, measurement, and
storage of content, and manufacture computers and many other popular devices that are
used by enterprises and consumers across Europe to access and consume a wide variety of
copyrighted works.
Because of these many different interests, we bring a unique perspective to copyright. We
believe deeply in the need for robust copyright protections, and in the freedom of authors to
offer their work on license terms that they define. But we also understand the critical
importance of a regime that balances the needs of the many stakeholders that copyright
serves, including consumers, internet intermediaries, and online services providers.
BSA fully supports flexibility in a modern copyright regime. Technology is moving quickly.
Software and creative content are increasingly shifting to the remote storage and delivery
and subscription services, with delivery over the Internet becoming the primary way that
copyrighted works are consumed. Consumers expect to enjoy content when, where and
how they want it; in order to meet these expectations, licensing models take myriad forms
today. On top of this, the use of data – including copyrighted data – has become
increasingly central to a wide range of online business models
Ultimately, Europe should aspire to a regime that provides strong and balanced protections
for authors while being sufficiently flexible and transparent to promote downstream
innovation and meet rapidly evolving consumer needs and expectations. Our comments
below are made with the objective of promoting each of these goals:—strong protections,
balance, and flexibility.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law 10.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management 11 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services 12; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe” 13 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition 14.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability 15.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


10
   This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
12
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term 16
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

 NO OPINION
BSA’s members provide a range of online services, and license content for those services
from many different sources. We understand the importance of a licensing regime that is
transparent and efficient, and that also facilitates the licensing of content across member
state borders.
Our view, however, has consistently been that market-led solutions are generally best in the
area of licensing. Indeed, innovative licensing models are already proliferating in the EU,
spelling out consumer rights and enabling software developers to develop new markets and
distribution schemes. To the extent those models contain limitations on geographic scope
or other terms, the license agreement should be paramount. If such marketplace limitations
are not viable or are uncompetitive, the marketplace will drive change. Marketplace
innovations and the freedom of contract that supports them have the greatest chance to
deliver the different features and choices that consumers want at the prices they desire.



B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC 17 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software 18 and databases 19.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders 20 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies 21, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission
– e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available –
and at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
17
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
18
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
19
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
20
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
21
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               11
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks 22. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.      The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public 23. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online

Because computer software is digital and often offered via the internet, the right of making
available to the public is critically important for software developers and one on which our
members rely heavily. In most instances, choice of law is spelled out in the licensing and
other contractual arrangements that apply to the use of software products. Where it is so
defined, the parties’ agreed choice of law should govern. Any efforts by the Commission to
clarify the scope of the “making available” right should leave contractual discretion to the



22
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
23
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
24
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

                                                                                                              12
parties in the first instance, and should ensure that whatever law the parties choose is
respected.
Even where contracts between the parties do not define the applicable law, however, we do
not see a need for regulatory intervention at this point in time. In our view, courts should be
given additional opportunity to interpret and apply the Court of Justice’s guidance on the
question of where a “making available” occurs. Depending on how this case law evolves,
clarifications or guidance from the Commission may be appropriate.


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief 25)?
YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION
As noted above, any efforts by the Commission to clarify the scope of the right should leave
contractual discretion to the parties in the first instance, and should ensure that whatever
law the parties choose is respected.
In the enforcement context (i.e. where third parties make our members’ works or the works
of others available without authorization), the scope of the right affects the interests of BSA
members in two ways: where the territorial scope is interpreted narrowly (i.e. where it is
restricted to the place where the act of uploading occurs), it impedes the ability to enforce
rights in all the countries where we suffer harm (i.e. markets targeted for distribution by the
uploader, where unauthorized copies of our works are downloaded and displace legitimate
market share). At the same time, very broad interpretations of the scope of the right (e.g.,
extending anywhere in the world that the work is potentially accessible) create substantial
challenges in relation to determining where rights need to be cleared. Accordingly, if the
Commission chooses to define where the making available occurs, the “targeting” test (i.e. a
test where the relevant criterion is not only country of upload, but that also looks to the
“targeting” of a certain Member State's public) would seem to strike an appropriate balance
among competing interests.

2.     Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
25
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                 13
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
 YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
The application of two rights to a single act of exploitation can create challenges, in
particular because it can lead to demands for compensation in order to exercise each right
involved. In most instances, online services providers should not be required to make
multiple payments with respect to a single act of exploitation of a digital copyright work.
Artificially “splitting” a single economic activity into separate rights that may be subject to
demands for compensation from different parties unnecessarily and unjustifiably fragments
the online services market in Europe.

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU 26 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU 27 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?

circumstances, and why

 NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
Hyperlinking is fundamental to the working of the internet, and directly benefits online
services providers, right holders and consumers. The provision of a link does not itself
involve a copyright infringing act (e.g., reproducing or communicating a work). Requiring
prior authorization for the provision of a hyperlink would be tremendously disruptive to the
internet ecosystem. Requiring prior authorization may also serve to restrict fundamental
rights, such as freedom of expression.
That said, those providing hyperlinks sometimes have the deliberate purpose of pointing
users to illegal material, frequently including copyright infringing content. The Commission
should ensure that effective causes of action and remedies are in place to deter and stop
bad actors that have no purpose other than facilitating illegal activity.

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
 NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
To the extent that copies are made during ordinary browsing of web pages, those copies fall
within the exception set out in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC. Any temporary copies
made in the cache or RAM are incidental to the use of the computer or device to view the
material and an essential part of the technology involved; applying a reasonable
interpretation of “no independent economic significance,” copies made during browsing
should be excepted from the reproduction right. Indeed, Article 5(1) was adopted to
facilitate just these sorts of copies, as explained in Recital 33 of the Directive.
This assumes, of course, that the temporary copies involved in the browsing satisfy either
prong (a) or prong (b) of Article 5(1) – i.e. that the copies relate to either (a) a transmission
in a network between third parties by an intermediary, or (b) a lawful use.

4.     Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible

                                                                                                15
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article) 28. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 29. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
As the Commission notes, the Court of Justice has held, in the Oracle v UsedSoft case, that
downloads of computer programs can trigger exhaustion in certain limited scenarios (i.e.
where the initial license permits a licensee to use the program for an unlimited period in
exchange for a one-time payment of a fee corresponding to the value of the right). However,
the CJEU – and, more recently, the German Federal Court tasked with applying the CJEU
decision in the original case (Oracle v UsedSoft) – imposed important restrictions on the
ability of licensees to “resell” copies of software. Among them, the licensee must delete or
otherwise render unusable the original copy or copies of its software prior to resale and the
initial licensee may not “divide” software licenses in order to resell copies of the program. In
addition, the transferee’s use of the “resold” copy continues to be subject to the license
terms agreed with the first licensee (the “intended purpose”), and it is a condition for the
validity of the transfer that the transferor shall inform the transferee about these license
terms.



28
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
29
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              16
This line of decisions raises several challenges. Under traditional concepts of exhaustion,
possession of a physical copy is prima facie proof of title. But when exhaustion is extended
beyond physical goods to include works disseminated digitally, proof of title becomes far
more complex. It is exceedingly difficult for software providers and secondary acquirers of
software to determine whether the initial licensee has in fact deleted or even stopped using
the original copies of software it licensed – or even whether the copies of software being
offered were legitimately licensed to the seller in the first instance. Identifying and
enforcing against overuse (i.e. where an initial licensee sells more copies than it in fact has
license for, or due to breach of other limitations and requirements of the license) ) is also
challenging.
All of this creates opportunities to sell or resell unlicensed or counterfeit copies, or copies
that cannot be legitimately sold under the UsedSoft judgment (e.g., because the original
copies have not been deleted or because the reseller is dividing a license in order to resell,
or because the original license was subject to ongoing payments, or because the recipient
through exhaustion does not abide by the number of authorized licenses or other
restrictions in the license) – greatly enhancing uncertainty about the legality of digital copies
in the online environment. This is a problem for software developers – but it also creates
substantial risks for customers, who have no way of being sure that they are buying a non-
infringing product. Ultimately, the significance of this risk depends on how national courts
apply the CJEU’s judgment.
In addition, expanding exhaustion beyond its traditional limits (i.e. the distribution right and
physical copies) discourages right holders from innovating in terms of the licenses they offer.
The traditional exhaustion framework provided strong incentives for software providers –
and, increasingly, other providers of content online – to develop flexible licensing models
that offer different use rights tailored and priced to meet the needs of different users.
Consumers benefit because the price that they pay reflects the use rights that they are
granted; in the enterprise context, this enables business customers to acquire licenses that
are closely matched to the needs of their business. These include, for example, “volume
licenses” (where discounts are given based on the number of users) and “site licenses”
(which allow for an unlimited number of users at a single site or in a single entity). Pricing
models also reflect these differences, with some enterprises and classes of users (for
example, academic institutions and students) enjoying discounts on license fees.
All that being said, given the current state of evolution in software business models in
general and value delivery models in particular, we remain concerned that any legislative
measures to address these points may create unintended impediments to the software
industry. We therefore suggest that no such legislative measures be pursued. Should the
Commission nevertheless consider addressing these issues via legislative measures, it is
essential that these measures include, as a minimum, the conditions for transfers as defined
by the CJEU and the German Federal Court in the Oracle v UsedSoft case.



                                                                                              17
It would also be essential that in any such measures, the Commission make it clear that
Oracle v UsedSoft applies only in a narrow range of very specific licensing scenarios, i.e.
where the initial license permits a licensee to use the program for an unlimited period in
exchange for a one-time payment of a fee corresponding to the value of the right. The
software sector’s business model is evolving rapidly. Developers are moving away from
traditional forms of distribution of the sort contemplated by in UsedSoft, where copies of
works are delivered via download and hosted on the user’s own premises; increasingly,
software is hosted in the “cloud” and made available via various subscription services to
users – allowing for far greater flexibility on the part of both software providers and their
customers. These new models are not and should not be affected by the CJEU’s judgment or
by exhaustion more generally.




C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute 30. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered 31.

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 32, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database 33 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition 34 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub 35 is seeking to take such
identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated
licensing across different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
BSA members welcome initiatives aimed at making rights ownership more transparent, and
at facilitating licensing of rights. Currently in Europe, there is often a lack of transparency in
terms of who owns (or manages) which rights; pricing can also be unclear. Wider use of
identifiers, and rights ownership databases, done properly, could be helpful to address these
challenges.
That said, it is important to recognize that the need for identifiers varies substantially across
sectors. Software already contain identifiers and, often, accompanying licenses. Ownership



32
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

and terms and conditions of an accompanying license are thus clear already, making any
centralized rights ownership database superfluous for these categories of works.
To the extent that the Commission decides to undertake initiatives in relation to identifiers,
those initiatives should not require online service providers and device manufacturers to
recognize any solutions ultimately adopted; the Copyright Directive’s balanced “no
mandate” provisions should apply to any identifiers ultimately deployed. In the fast moving
technology space, mandated solutions are often obsolete before they are even launched.
Mandatory systems also often “freeze” innovation, by deterring would-be competitors from
investing in the R&D necessary to bring alternative (and potentially better) solutions to
market.
It is also important that any solutions that are ultimately developed recognize the various
nuances related to different types of copyrighted material. For example, DRM (digital or
document rights management) is also used to protect sensitive and confidential information.
Many BSA member companies offer robust rights management solutions used to protect
sensitive information, such as financial data, trade secrets, or national security information.
Very often this sensitive information also constitutes copyrighted material, since copyright
arises without formalities at the creation of a literary work in the post-Berne environment.
It is essential that businesses, governments, and individuals have the freedom to choose the
best DRM for their purpose, including custom and proprietary solutions.
In addition, standardization of any rights management solutions should be undertaken
consistently with the practices that constitute open standards as understood by the
technology community and practiced by international standards-setting organizations, such
as IEEE, W3C, or ISO – including reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) licensing terms
for associated technologies, multiple independent implementations, a complete and freely
available specification (although not necessarily free of cost or copyright), etc.
Finally, any rights ownership databases must leave copyright licensing at the full discretion
of the rights owner. Weakening the ability of rights holders to control the exploitation of
their works threatens to undermine the incentives to create those works.

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention 36 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC 37.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law 38. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations
and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a
normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 39, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional 40, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"

may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B") 41.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain
In BSA’s experience, the lack of harmonization of exceptions has not been a significant
concern. As the consultation notes, in relation to software in particular, the exceptions in
the Computer Programs Directive are mandatory and thus largely harmonized across the
Member States – and in relation to the Directive 2001/29/EC (the Copyright Directive),
Article 5(1) – an exception that is critical to the functioning of the internet – is also
mandatory.
With regard to the copyright regime more generally, some flexibility is required for the
reasonable application of the Copyright Directive’s exceptions in the new digital
environment. But this flexibility is inherent in the language used to define the exceptions in
Article 5. The courts, in particular the CJEU, can use the flexibilities embedded in Article 5 so
as to ensure that the system of exceptions continues to fit the new environment. BSA thus
does not see a need to revise the existing framework of exceptions at this time.
NO OPINION

41
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           22

[Open question]
As described above, we do not believe the EU copyright framework requires radical reform.
The existing framework already has a significant degree of flexibility built in, including a
“menu” of non-mandatory exceptions that enable Member States latitude in structuring
national regimes. Interpretive guidance from the Commission based on CJEU case law could



                                                                                            23

[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving 42 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions 43. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive 44.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these

works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements

                                                                                           25
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.

problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries

                                                                                          26
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other 45. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted) 46.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC 47 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems

Heretofore, software licensing models enable software developers to tailor their offerings
for different uses, and to offer flexible arrangements such as reduced prices for software for
students and academic institutions. However, the UsedSoft line of decisions may adversely
affect this marketplace, by discouraging pricing differentials for the teaching and research
communities.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC 49 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 50.

The Marrakesh Treaty 51 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in

E.         Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics 52 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

52
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              32
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe” 53. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,

developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs 54. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions 55.

     IV.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying 56. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees 5758.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions 59 in the digital environment?
 YES – Please explain
Greater clarity about the scope and application of private copy levies is unquestionably
needed. The evolution of technology – and the ability of right holders to be more precisely
compensated for use of their works – calls into question the very foundation of private copy
levies. Yet private copy levy systems continue to operate the same way today as they did 20
years ago.
In particular, clarification about issues including how levies should apply to technologies
primarily directed at enterprise (i.e. professional) users, how levies should be adjusted to
reflect the application of technical protection measures to a given work, and what degree of
harm must be shown to merit levies would be welcomed. In addition, greater transparency
in the system is desperately needed – including in relation to how rates are set, how much is
collected by whom and how those monies are redistributed. We encourage the Commission
to focus on these questions – and on the levies regime more generally – as a priority.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
BSA strongly believes that rights holders should receive fair compensation for the use of
their works. But we do not believe that the extension of private copy levies advances this
objective, and we strongly oppose the application of levies to cloud services. Imposing levies
on cloud services would impede the competitiveness of cloud service providers in Europe,
and would unnecessarily disadvantage Europe’s cloud users.
The current levies system was developed at a time when right holders lacked the tools to
quantify the usage of their works with any precision, or to enforce restrictions on those
usages. While levies are highly inexact, at the time of their adoption, they represented the
best option for calculating and collecting compensation. Today, in contrast, levies make
increasingly less sense. In the context of cloud services, where users are permitted to make
copies of a licensed work on multiple devices, the license price for those works often already
factors in the making of multiple copies, and technological measures enforce the relevant
licensing terms. Requiring a levy in such cases is not necessary to fairly compensate the
author; to the contrary, levies in those scenarios constitute a double payment, compelling
consumers to pay twice for the same uses. In addition, imposing levies on cloud services
also discourages content providers from relying on, and innovating with, technologies that
can enable more precise compensation.
To the extent that unauthorized copies of content are hosted in the cloud, private copy
levies are also not a solution. Levies as contemplated under Directive 2001/29/EC are
intended to compensate for legitimately-made private copies, not pirate copies.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies? 61
 YES – Please explain
Consumers bear the financial burden of levies – yet they have virtually no information about
how levies are calculated, collected and redistributed, or about the impact of levies on the
price that they pay for media and devices. This complete lack of transparency would not be
acceptable in Europe in relation to any other commercial dealings with consumers – and it
should not be acceptable in relation to levies.
We would strongly support making the levy visible to consumers. In addition, a mechanism
should be provided to enable purchasers to seek “cash back” in cases where the media or

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments 62.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?

payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.
Under existing rules in Europe, each time a product crosses a border – whether from outside
the EU into the Union, or from one Member State to another – a levy must be paid. As a
result, BSA members frequently find their products being levied at least twice.
Ex-post reimbursement schemes are generally cumbersome and slow, and thus fail to
satisfactorily address the issue above. To the extent that levies remain in place, the more
sensible approach would be to focus collection of levies at the country of destination.

documents, emails etc.). As a consequence, it is currently common practice that B2B users
pay a levy for private copies of third-party works that they never actually make.


70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?
[Open question]
Where reimbursement schemes exist (e.g. Austria, France and the Netherlands), they have
been largely ineffective, as many market participants are not aware of such schemes and the
schemes are often too complex. Existing reimbursement schemes therefore fail to remedy
the problem that commercial users are paying a levy. The example of France, where such a
system is officially in place, is particularly telling. When replying to a written question of a
member of the French Parliament on July 30 2013, French Minister for Culture Ms. Aurélie
Filippetti, acknowledged that by 14 May 2013, Copie France had only received 294 requests
for reimbursement for business use. Of these, 176 were accepted and 118 were rejected.
Until 4 June 2013, the total amount reimbursed to professional users was €167.971: €67.000
in 2012 and €100.971 in 2013. However, at the end of 2011 the French government adopted
a law to bring the French legislation in line with the CJEU’s Padawan case and to exonerate
professional users from paying levies. As part of the preparatory works for this law, the
French          government’s          impact          assessment        (http://www.assemblee-
nationale.fr/13/projets/pl3875-ei.asp) predicted that the amount of private copying levies
collected in France (which amounted to 189 million EUR in 2010) would decrease by 20-30%
as a result of the reimbursement scheme for professional users within one year. This would
amount to yearly reimbursements in the range of 37.8 to 56.7 million euros. This
discrepancy illustrates the current inefficiency of the French reimbursement system.


71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
We encourage the Commission to move quickly, following the Vitorino report, to issue
guidance on the EU’s levies regime. Clarifications of certain issues in the near-term are
critically important. Among them, it needs to be clear that (i) levies are due only on copies
that fall within the private copying exception – and not on licensed (i.e. authorized) copies of
content or unauthorized (i.e. illicit) copies; and (ii) those seeking to collect levies must
demonstrate and quantify harm to the right holder from the copying involved, so that the
price of the levy has some basis in reality. In addition, collection of levies should be shifted
to the point of destination; the system needs to be more transparent, so that consumers
understand the impact of the levy on the price at the till; and there must be a mechanism for
the EU to monitor the distribution of levies, to ensure authors are indeed remunerated by



                                                                                             40
the levies. In the longer term, levies should be phased out altogether, and replaced by
alternative mechanisms, such as that recently introduced in Spain.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers 63 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 64. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

rights holders routinely experiment with different approaches that offer different sets of
rights at different price points. Regulating contractual freedom at the European level would

 VI.        Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE 65 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text 66. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose 67. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure 68. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 YES – Please explain
Directive 2004/48/ EC (the EU Enforcement Directive) introduced a number of important
mechanisms for the enforcement of rights. But gaps remain in the EU’s enforcement
framework. Moreover, implementation of the Directive is not consistent across the Member
States.
Damages are one particular area where additional action is merited. Because the software
industry’s most serious problem is use of copies in excess of what is permitted under
licenses by otherwise reputable corporate end-users, the industry uses the civil system to
enforce its rights rather than the criminal system. For that reason, perhaps more than other

of intellectual property rights.

   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
68
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           42
copyright industries, the software sector relies on damages to deter infringement. Under
both the WTO TRIPS Agreement and EU law, damage awards must both compensate the
rights holder and deter future infringements. But in software cases, courts in many markets
calculate damages based on the license fee that the infringer would have paid had it
acquired the software lawfully. Still other courts use an assessment that is based on what
the software provider would have actually received (rather than full retail value) or that
applies volume, status, wholesale or other discounts available to lawful users. This actually
encourages end-users to use software in excess of the permissions granted to them , and
take the (low) risk of getting caught, safe in the knowledge that at worst, it will cost no more
(and possibly less) than had they bought a license.
The Commission undertook substantial work in 2011 to review the effectiveness of each
Member State’s enforcement regime. As a next step, it would be helpful for the Commission
to return to those conclusions and consider where further guidance to Member States may
be appropriate. We strongly recommend that any such review and guidance focus on
commercial purpose infringements only, however; commercial purpose infringements cause
substantial harm to right holders and should be the Commission’s top enforcement priority.
Such guidance should not be linked in any way to or necessitate a reform of the copyright
acquis, which we believe should not be reopened at this time.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
BSA comes to this question from both as a victim of piracy and a provider of Internet based
services. Our members hold rights in highly valuable digital works – works that are routinely
offered without authorization online, costing the industry billions of Euros in lost revenues
annually. At the same time, our members are also Internet intermediaries, offering many of
Europe’s most popular online services and platforms. BSA companies suffer from the theft
of their digital content online and also work hard to keep unauthorized content off their
services.
Bringing this dual perspective to bear, we believe that the current legislative framework
governing online copyright enforcement and intermediary liability continues to
appropriately balance the needs of competing stakeholders. We do not support reform.


                                                                                             43
The Copyright Directive and the E-Commerce Directive include a set of careful compromises
designed to protect the interests of copyright owners, service providers and users. The E-
Commerce Directive safe harbors from liability for providers who serve as mere conduits, or
cache or host illegal content – and the corollary provision making clear that those providers
have no duty to monitor for such content – are the crux of this compromise. These rules
have given online intermediaries clear incentives to behave responsibly in operating their
services, including by acting expeditiously to remove infringing content in response to
appropriate notices from rights holders, while ensuring that bad actors remain subject to
substantial criminal penalties and civil remedies. At the same time, the rules have shielded
responsible online intermediaries from the burden of actively policing their users or
constantly monitoring their networks for infringing conduct—obligations that would weaken
incentives for innovation and threaten the dynamism and values that have made the
Internet so valuable and attractive to users.
In our experience, the current rules provide sufficient flexibility to impose meaningful
penalties and damages on bad behavior by online providers, and thereby generate
meaningful deterrence, without raising undue risks of punitive measures that could deter
legitimate actors from engaging in socially beneficial behavior. Re-opening the legislative
framework around intermediary liability would undermine this compromise. Any effort to
“recalibrate” the level of remedies available against online service providers for secondary
infringement liability, by contrast, could undermine the balance struck under the existing
rules and disrupt the legitimate expectations that have been built around it.
That said, there may be merit in the Commission considering soft guidance in this area. For
example, guidance on what qualifies as “expeditious” might be helpful, in order to prevent
websites from leaving infringing material available to download or distribute from their sites
for weeks, and then arguing that their actions were appropriately quick and that their
liability is limited. Similarly, there is no clear standard in the EU on the steps rights holders
must take when making claims of infringement online, or on what information right holders
must provide in order to enable intermediaries to identify and review allegedly infringing
material. There is also no clear standard within the EU for intermediaries to replace
removed content upon remediation or upon a contest by the alleged infringer. Guidance in
these areas could also be helpful.


77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
 YES – Please explain
 NO – Please explain
Our response to this question is both “yes” and “no”.

In some cases, the framework strikes an appropriate balance. For example, the CJEU
judgments (e.g., SABAM v Netlog, SABAM v Scarlet) in relation to the obligations of network
intermediaries to filter content appropriately balance authors’ rights against data protection
rights and the rights of online services providers to pursue a business interest.
There could be better balance between data protection and intellectual property rights in
other cases, however. To be clear, BSA members prioritize privacy in their products and
services, and have long supported strong, harmonized data protection rules in the EU; it is
evident to us that customers will only use the internet and online services if they are certain
that there is a robust legal framework in place to keep their private data safe online. At the
same time, however, we also see that data protection rules can sometimes create
unnecessary obstacles to the enforcement of rights. For example, in order to identify
websites distributing software without authorization, we often rely on IP addresses. IP
addresses are generally viewed as personal data, even if the entity processing the data
cannot connect that IP address to a particular individual – and some Member States deem IP
addresses judicial data that can be processed only by government authorities. These
interpretations create challenges for the enforcement of rights online.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
YES
NO
 NO OPINION
Offering an opinion on a single EU copyright title is difficult without understanding the
details of what such a regime would look like. We would welcome more information about
the Commission’s thinking. The comments below are thus preliminary.
As a general rule, greater harmonization of most EU legal systems is helpful for businesses
operating or providing services across Member State borders. But in the field of software,
rights are individually managed without the need in most instances to go through complex
collective management systems. A single copyright title is thus not an imperative from the

                                                                                            45
software side (although a title that could be enforced before courts competent to grant pan-
EU remedies could be helpful, and could substantially reduce the cost of enforcing
copyright).
In relation to works other that software (e.g., music, audio-visual content), in contrast, a
single copyright title could be helpful. A single title could improve transparency in relation
to rights ownership, as well as simplify licensing and reduce related transaction costs.
However, we anticipate significant complexities in moving to a single copyright title. For
example, because of the term of copyright protection, transitioning to a pan-EU title could
be highly complicated, as there would be a many-year overlap during which both national
and pan-EU rights would exist. We would be interested in understanding how the
Commission would address this and similar issues.
79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

VIII.     Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
BSA appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Commission’s consultation, and we look
forward to continued dialogue on the many important questions it raises.
The Commission consultation comes at a transitional moment for the copyright industries,
who are poised for a radical shift. Physical formats are rapidly becoming obsolete; in the
next few years, most content will be accessed through downloads over the internet or via
subscription services. And new forms of content are coming to the fore, as are new uses of
traditional content.
The digitization of content, the increased use of the internet to deliver content, and the
explosion in the use of mobile devices to consume content, offer tremendous opportunity
for stakeholders in the copyright ecosystem. These trends enable consumers to access and
enjoy content whenever and wherever they choose, with works now being disseminated in
new (and increasingly consumer-driven and consumer-friendly) ways. And content owners
can get their works to market more quickly in a marketplace characterized by many
innovative delivery platforms.

                                                                                           46
In every instance, the commercial viability of these models depends on licenses that
consumers can rely on to spell out their rights and entities making works available can rely
on to develop new markets and distribution schemes. Software licenses, for example,
enable software developers to tailor their offerings to accommodate a range of customer
needs, allowing them to offer different features and charge different prices to different
types of customers (e.g., students and academic institutions, home users, businesses) and
for different customer needs (e.g., per-use, per-user, per-device). And the importance of
licensing will only increase as cloud computing and other online models for distributing and
accessing software become more widespread.
The centrality of licensing is not only a characteristic of the software sector. Other industries
are quickly following the software sector’s lead. In the music, movie and publishing sectors
today, similarly innovative licensing arrangements are being deployed in response to
evolving consumer demand.
In considering its next steps, it will be important that the Commission identify measures that
encourage – rather than hinder – the exciting changes underway in how works are
developed, distributed and consumed. To that end, it is critically important that the EU
copyright regime promote and protect the freedom of authors to license their works as they
see fit, in response to the demands of customers and of the market.
