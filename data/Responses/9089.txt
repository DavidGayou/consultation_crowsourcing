Preliminary remarks
Fastweb welcomes the EU Commission Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules
and thanks the European Commission for providing a new opportunity to re -affirm our
views on this matter.


As this consultation greatly overlaps with previous public consultations on issues related to
copyright, enforcement and distribution of content online, and given that no policy
initiative has been taken at EU level, Fastweb would like to rei terate the validity of the
various positions sent to the Commission in a number of occasions in the past years.
Namely:

The respondent

Fastweb has been among the first operators in Europe to roll out a FTTH NGA network,
passing approximately 1.2 million households in 7 major urban areas in Italy. In 2002
Fastweb has developed one of the first European IPTV platforms, offering movies and other
entertainment content to its broadband customers, via a proprietary IPTV set -top box. Due
to a number of reasons that will be developed in depth below Fastweb – as other broadband
operators which have decided to launch similar IPTV offers - has had crucial problems in
building an attractive content offer and as a consequence IPTV in Italy has failed t o
become a consolidated consumer proposition. The provision of video and IPTV services was
thus progressively dismissed.


Fastweb’s is currently massively deploying a VDSL-FTTC network as an alternative operator
in Italy, but this is not an isolated case in Europe. The transition from FTTH to FTTC has in
fact dramatically decreased the cost and timeframe of deploying an ultra -broadband
infrastructure allowing operators different from the incumbent to play an active role in the
game of fibre roll-out.


This is an excellent news for the digital single market, as competition between different
infrastructures will lead prices down, allowing a massive adoption of the NGA services. The
roll out of new generation network in a competitive context is a key prerequi site for the
development of digital services and of a digital single market. Without adequate and
homogenous roll-out of fibre networks throughout Europe, it will be impossible for
European players to develop digital services that will be for the major par t “bandwidth
hungry” and strictly dependent from the existent of such new networks. Not having a
sufficient “scale” is, in fact, one of the major barrier s that put European companies at
disadvantage compared to US companies , especially when it comes to aud iovisual content
creation and distribution .




                                                   2
The relationship between content distribution and high speed broadband networks is
mutually beneficial: as next generation networks open the gates to new and innovative
content offerings, the presence of such o fferings – which would be facilitated by a thriving
digital single market – creates the necessary demand for broadband take -up.




Answers to the questionnaire

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?
2: Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across borders in the
EU?
Fastweb believes that currently there are few legal obstacles preventing or hindering the
development of cross -border content. The fragmentation of digital distribution across
Europe is mainly due to the commercial and contractual practice s of rights-holders which
has led to a rigid segmentation of the market in order to maximise profits on a country by
country basis, to t he detriment of consumers and the single market. 2 Such fragmentation is
particularly blatant in when subscribers to digital content distribution services are
prevented to access the content they paid for within the EU, but outside their country of
residence.


The number of European citizens choosing to live in countries different from their original
ones is now sensibly growing - even as consequence of the free movement of citizen across
the European Union – so is the number of consumers seeking to receive audiovisual
services from their original countries. This is currently not allowed by the majority of free -
to-air and pay-tv services that proceed to encrypt their programming when broadcast via
satellite or limit through other means 3 the fruition of content by consumer that are living
outside the national borders. This is due to the way audiovisual rights are purchased which
allows broadcasters to exploit those same rights only within the territory for which they
have been purchased. Moreover, with respect to audiovisual content, the commercial
availability of multi-language digital audio tracks and of subtitles is still very limited,
despite in average increasingly consumers want to have the choice on whether to access
content in its original version or in another language.


With the emergence of cloud services that should allow access anywhere, anytime and on
any platform, it is hard for the average consumer to understand why she is prevented to

  The European Commission (DG COMP) has opened an investigation covering such anti-competitive behaviours on 13 January 2014.
See http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-15_en.htm
3
  This is even more evident following the launch by many broadcasters of catch up television services made available through the
internet. As such they would be available to consumers also living in countries different from the broadcasters. Nevertheless, legal
download of content is made unavailable though geolocalisation of IP addresses.



                                                                  3
access the content she paid for, or the services she subscri bed to, while travelling within
the EU. License based geographical restrictions that impose to service providers to put in
place systems of geo -localisation in order to prevent their customers to access their
content while abroad are a flagrant obstacle to the establishment of a digital single market.


This does not mean that licenses should be automatically allowed on a pan -EU or multi-
territorial basis, but consumers that purchased the licenses in their country of residence
should be able to freely access their content without restrictions. There are different
mechanisms    that   could allow content portability without harming the           principle of
territoriality: one, for example, could be incentivising or make compulsory licensing
schemes for private uses that should be permitted outside the licensee country of
residence.




7.     Do you think that further measures (legislat ive or non-legislative, including market -
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross -border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
YES – A comprehensive revie w of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright in the Information
Society would be needed along with clear measures specifically aimed at ending the current
restrictive licensing practices. S uch review should have the scope , having examined the
proper balance of c opyright, innovation and fundamental rights in the digital environment,
to adapt the copyright framework accordingly. To make an example, in a recent decision of
the ECJ (Nintendo vs.PC Box ) it was found that traditional remedies under copyright law
may be abused and became detrimental for innovation and freedom of business. Therefore,
it is time to reconsider whether the co pyright framework in force actually fits the needs of
the new digital and technological environment. See also question 21 below.

A.     Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised
(or not) in digital transmissions?

8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross -border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


YES - In general terms, however , the distinction between communication and reproduction
rights when distributing rights over the Internet should be deeply revised. Such distinction
is the result of consolidat ed commercial practices develo ped in the traditional analogue
business and the simple transposition into the digital world is questionable. In addition,
such a distinction creates complexities and uncertainties for undertakings and people
willing to license rights for digital content w ith the result that businesses and creativity are




                                               4
hindered, while piracy may be somehow even encouraged. The EU should therefore start to
analyse whether a unique ad-hoc communication right should be created for the
exploitation of content through digital networks.


This said, we note that the territorial scope of the “making available” right would have the
effect of legally sealing the current partition between national territories within the EU for
copyright purposes. The EU should have the ambition of ha rmonizing copyright law and
thus creating a single EU territory for copyright purposes.


10.    Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?
YES – Measures aimed at making less burdensome the licensing process would be
beneficial, including the legal “bundling of rights” provided that it does not create anti -
competitive incentives for the licensing body, which must always seek the objective of
maximum distribution along with efficient revenues.


11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
NO - Hyperlinks are reference to data that the reader can directly follow to find an already
available content. Their function is to link any information to any other information over
the Internet - in other words they are therefore integral to the creat ion and functioning of
the World Wide Web. A link is not a transmission or communication of the work but a
reference to an already available work.


Furthermore, sharing hyperlinks on the I nternet is one of the most common activities.
Requiring the authoris ation from a rightholder before sharing a hyperlink would not only be
cumbersome for business and innovation but would also undermine the fundamental right
of free speech.


The Court of Justice of the European Union in the Svens son case (case C 466/12 Nils
Svensson and Others v Retriever Sverige AB , ruling of 13 February 2014 ) made it clear that
clickable hyperlinks (as well as framing links) to an authorized publicly available work does
not infringe the communication to the public right because the public is not new.
Hyperlinking has been considered as an act of communication to the public pursuant to the
Copyright Directive (Directive 2001/29/EC) , but the CJUE has specified that, in the
concrete circumstances of the provision on a website of clickable links to works freely
available on another website, co pyright protection does not apply and, therefore,
authorization from the rights -holder is not required.




                                               5
This ruling clarifies the applicability of current copyright protection rules to hyperlinking.
An extension of this protection to hyperlinking beyond t he perimeter established by the
CJUE would be extremely harmful to innovation and fundamental freedoms as it would
make free access to information difficult, cumbersome and it would only benefit certain
categories of neighbouring rightholders.



12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the tempo rary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


NO - Viewing of webpages is a widely accepted general practice and part of the everyday
life of users all around the World. If merely viewing, without downloading or printing a
website was subject to copyright, many people are likely to infringe copyright while
browsing the Internet and coming across websites containing copyright protected material.
Although the normal use of the I nternet involves the creation of copies, this is the
automatic result of browsing the internet. The making of such copies in the cache is
indispensable for efficient web -browsing and therefore in line with Article 5 (1) of the
Directive 2001/29/EC. The copies retained on the screen or in the cache are merely the
incidental consequence of the use of a computer, and are temporary.
Furthermore, as suggested in the opinion of the UK Supreme Court “ it has never been an
infringement, in either English or EU law, for a person merely to view or read an infringing
article in physical form. ”



20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection stil l appropriate in the digital
environment?
NO – The current terms are excessively long and are nowadays a crucial limitation to the
availability of content online. The term of 50 years after the death of the author prescribed
by the Berne convention of 1886 are not fit for the digital environment, which has the
unlimited potential of dissemination of cultural material. The 70 years after the death of
the author term of protection provided by the EU is hardly incentivizing the production of
content and its dissemination.


Shortening the term of protection at least until the minimum 50 years provided by the
Berne Convention would create a competitive advantage to EU enterprises creating and
distributing content as they would gain accessibility to 20 years of c urrently protected
material.

III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
YES - Fastweb believes that the European copyright legislation currently in force needs to
be revised in order to improve and harmonise rights as well as protection systems and
adapt them to the development of the digital single market . Some areas of traditional
copyright rules appear unfit with the way content protected by intellectual property
circulates over electronic communications networks. Furthermore, the exhaustive list of
strictly defined exceptions lacks flex ibility to adapt to the changes occurring in a rapidly
evolving environment for content, creation, access and distribution.


In the interest of all stakeholders, it is essential to offer the broadest, reasonable and most
predictive scope to the exceptions in Article 5, under the condition that these be read
within the context of the three -step test described in Article 5.5.


In particular, as regards the Private Copying exception, we note that Member States are
allowed to adopt their own copyright limitati ons. Article 5.2.b of the Directive enables
Member States to provide for exceptions and limitations " in respect of reproductions on
any medium made by a natural person for private use and for ends that are neither directly
nor indirectly commercial, on con dition that the rightholders receive fair compensation
which takes account of the application or non -application of technological measures
referred to in Article 6 to the work or subject -matter concerned ". However, only a few
Member States in the EU have implemented article 5.2.b and those who made it regulated
the exception in a very heterogeneous way. The absence of clear principles also generated
ambiguity in identifying the possible technologies that individuals may use for the purposes
of creating a private copy. As an example, in some Member State s the legislative framework
seems to allow use of old technology of copy called “PVR3” (as DVD recorder) that works
off line while preventing the use of enhanced technologies as Network PVR4.


The disrespect of the technological neutrality principle in the private copy exception
currently allows Member States to implement national rules that discriminate between
recording devices/technologies with same functionalities, only on the basis of their
respective technological features. This could prevent parties in the single market from
pursuing in the online environment practices, which would not be restricted in the offline
environment. As a result, business ventures dealing with digital content will require mor e
time and money to acquire all necessary permits. The above generates distortion in the
market and prevents the development of technological innovation.


22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?


                                               7
YES - The number of exceptions presented in the list of Articles 5.2 to 5.5 of the
2001/29/CE Directive should become made mandatory (instead of optional) anytime this is
necessary to protect and ensure fundamental c itizens’ rights, effective availability of
digital content as well as proper cross -border circulation of the same.


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific ca ses.
Considering the large size and increasing number of user -generated content (“UGC”),
failure to adopt the copyright regime to the digital reality risks creating a situation where
activities perceived as normal by users are made illegal. This would unde rmine the
credibility of copyright law among average users and thus threaten broader right holder
interests.


In order to clearly recognise the difference between the use of protected material as part
of new UGC and illegal file sharing of a work, it would be necessary to adapt the copyright
regime to include audiovisual content which incorporates users’ creative output, creating
this way a completely new work escaping to traditional copyright .




IV. Private copying and reprograph y


64.    In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?


YES – There is a need to rethink the entire private copy model as far as the current fa ir
compensation mechanism may provoke abuses, competition distortion , internal market
fragmentation, legal uncertainty, technology discrimination and, in general, detriment to
the growth of broadband and digital services. The European instituti ons should therefore
carefully consider whether a fair compensation mechanism is still needed in a digital world
which provides rightholders with proper and actual remuneration systems .


We recognise that t he current system of private copying levies still represents an
important source of revenue supporting artists and culture in certain EU countries.
However, other countries, like the UK for instance, manage to have a thriving cultural
industry without compensation through private copying levies. In this context and
considering the switch between the analogue and the digital media worlds, Fastweb believe
it would be necessary to put in place a gradual shift from private copying levies regimes to
full licensing regimes (like the UK), where user licences cover the potential harm suffered
by rightholders in case of unauthorized acts of reproduction.


                                              8
Such       an    approach       would      avoid    market       fragmentation,        competitive        distortions   and
discrimination between technolog ies, it would provide legal certainty. In addition phasing
out of private copying levies would finally prove to be the most future proof solution in a
very rapid technology evolving environment.



65.        Should digital copies made by end users for private pu rposes in the context of a
service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?
NO - As stated            in Recital 35 of Directive 2001/29/EC ” In certain cases of exceptions or
limitations, right-holders should receive fair compensation to compensate them adequately
for the use made of their protected works or other subject -matter. When determining the
form, detailed arrangements and possible level of such fair compensation, account should
be taken of the particular circumstances of each case.                                        When evaluating these
circumstances, a valuable criterion would be the possible harm to the right -holders
resulting from the act in question.


In cases where right-holders have already recei ved payment in some other form, for
instance as part of a licence fee, no specific or separate payment may be due. The level of
fair compensation should take full account of the degree of use of technological protection
measures referred to in Directive 2001/29/EC. In certain situations where the prejudice to
the right-holder would be minimal, no obligation for payment may arise.


The directive thus excludes already the application of levies as a compensation for private
copy when the recording support is used to store content that has been regularly
purchased on line, as in this case the consumer has already paid rights in accordance with a
licensing agreement; in this case, consumers directly pay rightholder s so the directive
excludes the taxation of equ ipment used to do a digital copy, to avoid a duplication of
burdens.




66.        How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
                                                                                                                          4
As recognized in the 2013 recommendations of Antonio Vitorino on Copyright Levies                                         :
” Usually, a service provider acquires a license from the rightholder that covers all

4
    http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/levy_reform/130131_levies-vitorino-recommendations_en.pdf



                                                                 9
copyright relevant acts involved in the provision of the service, including the reproduction
of copyright protected content by the end user. Such licensing agreements also reflect the
view and the expectations of the en d user. A person paying for e.g. the download of a song
expects that this payment does not only cover the first download of that song onto his or
her personal computer but also the subsequent copying of that song to a certain number of
his or her mobile devices, as determined by the usage rules of the service provider.
Similarly, a person subscribing to a music streaming service is usually not only paying for
the online streaming to his or her device/s but also for the possibility to create "playlists"
that can be listened to when "offline".
[…]
In this context, it should be kept in mind that the levy system was put in place because, in
the offline environment, rightholders did not have any other possibility to be compensated
for copies made by end users. The online environment, however, allows a much more
targeted provision of copyright protected content to consumers, including with regard to
copies made for private purposes. Content can now be delivered to consumers in the exact
way they expect to receive it. Licence agreements reflect these new ways of distributing
content to consumers and allow rightholders to be adequately remunerated for the
exploitation of their works and other protected subject matter. The use of so called
"technical protection measures" enable the contractually agreed scope of a licence to be
mirrored, and acts that go beyond what rightholders have been paid for in the form of a
licence fee to be prevented. They are widely used to sustain different business models (for
instance downloads versus streaming) and strengthen the case for direct licensing.


Fastweb believes that private copying levies should not be applied to cloud services in
general, since the entire Internet environment and the most popular services (e -mail, social
networks, sharing platforms) may be considered a form of cloud. In any case, should a more
narrow definition of cloud be agreed for this purpose, levies should not be applied to the
extent that copies that are made by end users for private purposes in the cont ext of a
service that has been licensed by rightholders do not cause any harm that would require
additional remuneration in the form of private copying levies.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?
YES – Consumers should be clearly aware of the amount of money that is transferred to
collecting societies when they purchase products and devices subject to private copying
levies. Keeping the majority of consumers unaware of the price compone nts creates market
distortions and constitutes an incentive for collecting societies to raise their revenues from
private copying levies. On the other hand, making levies visible could create general
awareness that would also push collecting societies to b ecome more transparent and
efficient.


                                              10
Respect for rights
75.   Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
NO - Fastweb considers that the current framework, c onsisting namely of the IPRED
Directive (Directive 2004/48/EC on the enforcement o f intellectual property rights ) as it
stands as well as the E -Commerce Directive (Directive 2000/31/EC), offers a well-balanced
and functioning framework to address in partic ular online IPR infringements. The reason
for this is that IPRED contains checks and balances for enforcement that are not present in
the Copyright Directive. It ensures that the protection of IPR is balanced with fundamental
freedoms and rights.    IPRED al so provides for injunctions against intermediaries whose
services are used by a third party for any proven IPR infringement, and lays down the
minimum legal conditions that must be adhered to by national courts when formulating
injunctive measures; while t he E-Commerce Directive ensures that such injunctions cannot
result in general monitoring obligations.
If problems arise in the uniform respect of copyright, they stem from the late or
uncompleted implementation of the IPRED at national level and not fro m its legal
provisions. However, should there be in the future a need to address the enforcement of
copyright, this should be done in the context of the IPRED and not separately in the
Directive 200/29/EC, for the reasons mentioned above.


76.   In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for     sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
YES - Articles 9 and 11 of the IPRED already introduced injunctions against intermediaries
whose services are used by a third party for any proven IPR infringement, and lays down
the minimum legal conditions that must be adhered to by national courts when formulating
injunctive measures. These mechanisms proved to be efficient for right s-holders in the
enforcement of their rights, especially w ith regards to commercial infringement, and are
largely used across Europe.


At the same time article 12 -15 of the E-Commerce Directive ensure that such injunctions are
proportionate and cannot result in general monitoring obligations. In the past years th e
European Court of Justice explicitly dealt with the possible scope of injunctions against
internet intermediaries (e.g. C -324/09 - L’Oreal/eBay; C-70/10 - Scarlet Extended; C-
360/Sabam/Netlog) and made clear that such injunctions need to be very spec ific with
regards to the measures to be taken by intermediaries and must not merely be success




                                             11
oriented. For example general filtering systems installed for the prevention of copyright
infringements were held disproportionate.


Multi-stakeholder cooperation should not be limited to ISP cooperating with right s-holders
to defend the latter existing business models. Cooperation should also concern:
      •   Widespread availability of legal online content in affordable price
      •   Education of consumers


Furthermore, current ly DG Markt of the Commission is working on an Action Plan
addressing IPR infringement. The initiative recognises the wide range of intermediaries and
aims at exploring non-legislative initiatives, such as:
      •   Improving exchange of information and cooperation between relevant authorities in
             charge of enforcement of IPR in the Member States ;
      •   strengthening due diligence across the entire supply chains for products/services
             which depend heavily on intellectual property ;
      •   Developing a MoU on advertising (i.e. “Follow the money” approach).


77.       Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal dat a?
See also answer to question 75.
The current system of civil enforcement is fit for purpose and gives effective possibilities
for the rightholders to seek redress. Redress takes place rapidly through the injunctive
relief mechanism provided by Directive 2004/48/EC that requires the involvement of a
judicial authority. Copyright enforcement in the digital environment requires striking a
delicate balance between the fundamental right of private property, the right to
privacy/confidential communication and t he freedom of expression. Too often certain
stakeholders advocate stricter enforcement and disproportionate enforcement measures in
an attempt resist changes required in their business models by significant technological
developments entailing shift in con sumption behaviors of end-users.
In this context, as an access provider, Fastweb still observes high demand for an online
legal offer of content that struggles to meet consumers’ expectations.
Accordingly the priority should be for policy makers to remo ve all obstacles hindering
smooth licensing of content online allowing the development of attractive legal services.


As far as audiovisual content is concerned Fastweb observes the following obstacles to the
creation of a vibrant digital single market fo r content able to create competitive offer
shifting users from illegal to legal platforms:


a) windowing system


                                                  12
    Windowing strategies are yet another source of opportunity for the development of
    piracy, jeopardising both the development of a thriving European market for online
    content and destroying value for the producers and distributors.
    Specific content (movies, tv drama, series) are made available for distribution on
    different platforms at specific times. Movies for instance are made available in theatre
    first, then after 3-4 months as home video rental and home video sell through, then,
    after an additional 2-3 months, in video on demand on cable or IPTV platforms. Although
    all the mentioned delivery mechanisms involve the direct payment of the specific
    content, yet the consumer is not allowed to select the way he can access the content.
    Consumer choosing to view the content at home, via an IPTV platform for instance, will
    have to wait for the content to be released in theatre first and then as home -video.


b) differentiation in the release time in different countries
    On top of that, content is often released at different times in different countries in an
    attempt to adjust to national specif icities and consequently maximise revenues.


    Although legitimate, this trade practices – that were effective in a mass market in which
    the producer and distributor had total control over the way content was delivered to the
    final customers – are not in line with the new context, where consumers have means to
    overcome the artificial barriers created by the producers.


    Given the escalating number of internet connections, the increasing power of bandwidth
    and the explosion of social networking and collaborative web tools, most consumers are
    in the position to gather info on the content that is being released and make decision
    about their consumption strategy. The average consumer is simply not willing to wait or
    to accept such a rigid segmentation: even if t hey are prepared to pay, they will not
    accept that the producer dictates how and when they should consume their content. New
    communications technologies push towards the creation of a global market of media
    service at worldwide level, especially for premiu m product such as film features and TV
    series.


    Therefore as legitimate demands to receive and consume audiovisual content with a
    certain degree of flexibility are not met by operators, users in the best scenario resort
    to grey market 5 – in some cases infringing copyright law – or to piracy. In both cases
    value is either destroyed – pay-content is hacked and consumed for free – or distracted
    by the market it artificially belonged: instead of consuming local media, the user
    consumes media meant for a differe nt market.

 For instance subscribing to pay-tv services in their home countries and then using the set-top box from a different one or using
ways to hide their IP address (the so called IP spoofing) therefore being able to download free or pay content that was meant to be
downloaded or streamed only within a specific territory.



                                                                 13
c) Portability of content
  Please see also answer to question 2 above.


In order to promote the freedom of service circulation (and to some extent also piracy), all
necessary measures should be taken in orde r to stimulate a deep restructuring in the way
broadcasting rights are dealt allowing European media services providers to deliver
content to their potential consumer base when and where the demand exists. Such
measures may include:
      -   reorganise the windowing system in order to allow for the simultaneous release of
          movies in theatre, home video and VOD
      -   the simultaneous release of content in different territories would probably also
          sensibly reduce the occasions for illegal download of copyrighted material.


The industry can make legitimate downloading easier and che aper than pirating by allowing
digital content libraries available at the same time the content becomes available through
other platforms and making them attractive through feasible pricing schemes for high
quality.


To sum up, rather than focusing on the current civil enforcement system, if more online
content were made available via practicable and alternatives market propositions, piracy
would be significantly reduced. Release windows policies prevent end users from accessing
legal online content – which presumably makes them feel pushed to, and justified to, use
alternative – even illegal - means of accessing content. Therefore copyright holders should
extend their offers to users under reasonable conditions.


VII. A single EU Copyright Title
78.       Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU,
as well as a single framework for enforcemen t?
79.       Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
YES – The EU should pursue the establishment of a Single EU Copy right title not only for
the purposes of consistent legislation as an objective per se. The Commission should have
the courage to propose concrete harmonization measures in order help in the long term the
global competitiveness of its content creation and distribution businesses which could
reach new economies of scale by eliminating all incentives to segment the market in order
to maximize revenues.

Fastweb recognizes that this would be a long term and very ambitious goal but nearly all
the recent Conclusions of the Competitiveness Council of Ministers and also the latest
European Council Conclusions of October 2013 call for the establishment of a digital single
market.
