Name:
FEDOWEB - FEDERAZIONE OPERATORI WEB
Fedoweb (Federazione Operatori Web) è una associazione italiana senza scopo di lucro
costituita nel 2000 per la promozione dello sviluppo di Intenet finalizzato alla creazione di un
mercato della pubblicità online sempre più sofisticato, nonché per l'individuazione, lo studio e
la realizzazione di ogni iniziativa diretta alla soluzione dei problemi comuni degli associati
nell'evolversi nel settore della pubblicità e della comunicazione digitale online (ulteriori
informazioni sono disponibili al sito www.fedoweb.it). A questo scopo Fedoweb collabora
attivamente con Audiweb (Joint Industry Committee partecipata dalla stessa Fedoweb al 50%,
con UPA al 25% e Assap Servizi S.r.l., l'azienda di servizi di AssoComunicazione al 25%)
che ha lo scopo di fornire informazioni oggettive e imparziali sul mercato, di carattere
quantitativo e qualitativo, sulla fruizione del mezzo internet e su ogni altra rete o sistema
online utilizzando opportuni strumenti di rilevazione.
Fedoweb annovera tra i suoi associati importanti attori del mercato, quali Alfemminile.com,
Banzai, Class Editori, Editoriale Domus, Edizioni Condé Nast, Kataweb / Gruppo L'Espresso,
Il Messaggero, Il Sole 24 Ore, Italia Online (Libero / Matrix), Leonardo Adv, Mediaset,
Microsoft, Rainet (Gruppo Rai), RCS Digital, Seat Pagine Gialle, La Stampa, Tiscali.
Con il presente documento Fedoweb intende partecipare alla "Public Consultation on the
review of the EU copyright rules" in qualità di associazione di editori online.
Resta pertanto inteso che gli associati, anche in virtù dei differenti ruoli svolti nel mercato,
potranno esporre il proprio particolare punto di vista sul tema della modifica della
regolamentazione comunitaria in materia di tutela del diritto d'autore nelle sedi e nei modi che
riterranno più opportuni, anche eventualmente partecipando in proprio conto alla presente
consultazione.
Fedoweb esprime il proprio apprezzamento per l'iniziativa, ritenendo che il delicato tema
della tutela del diritto d'autore sulle reti di comunicazione elettronica possa essere
proficuamente affrontato ascoltando anche il parere dei diversi stakeholder del mercato ed
acquisendo consapevolezza delle complessità tecnico-economiche che lo caratterizzano.
Pur ritenendo Fedoweb che tutti i temi sollevati dalla presente Consultazione siano rilevanti
ha ritenuto di concentrarsi sul tema del linking (di cui alla domanda 11 del presente
documento), che si ritiene essere più pressante rispetto alle esigenze degli editori online.

    I.      Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management2 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services3; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
3
   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

                                                                                                                  6
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
         - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)

2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
         - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.

5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?

6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?

holders?

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC8 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software9 and databases10.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders11 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies12, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks13. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights

certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

of computer programs.
10
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
11
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
12
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
13
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                                 9
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public14. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


       – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach15)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief16)?
         – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….




14
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
15
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
16
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                              10
2.         Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
        – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

3.         Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU17 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU18 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
     YES
Ad avviso di Fedoweb la risposta a questa domanda dovrebbe essere affermativa.
In particolare, qualora gli estratti dei contenuti editoriali pubblicati online dagli editori siano
sfruttati sistematicamente dai motori di ricerca o soggetti analoghi che svolgono attività di
indicizzazione delle notizie riproducendo link ai contenuti stessi, tali soggetti dovrebbero
chiedere idonea autorizzazione agli editori, a favore dei quali dovrebbe peraltro essere
riconosciuta una forma di remunerazione.

Molti sono gli episodi che si potrebbero segnalare. A mero titolo esemplificativo si richiama
la prassi, ormai consolidata, di un motore di ricerca quale Google attraverso il sistema Google
News, servizio di aggregazione di notizie che, senza alcun intervento umano - e attraverso il
servizio di Search - scandaglia le notizie pubblicate sui siti internet degli editori,
estrapolandone titoli e sommari per fornire una panoramica di notizie rilevanti in un
determinato territorio. Si tratta di una rassegna stampa online realizzata tramite le notizie
pubblicate da editori terzi, ai quali non è richiesta alcuna autorizzazione (anche per effetto
delle incertezze normative sul tema del linking).
Tramite collegamenti ipertestuali o link presenti sulla home page di Google News si accede
direttamente alla pagina interna del sito produttore del contenuto informativo, saltando la
home page del sito stesso (il c.d. sistema del "deep linking").
Posto che la maggior parte degli introiti pubblicitari dei siti informativi deriva dai banner
presenti nella home page, è di tutta evidenza che il mancato passaggio dell'utenza dalla home
page provoca agli editori un danno in termini di mancato guadagno, oltre che di mancata
fidelizzazione dell'utente che preferisce affidarsi al servizio di Google News, anziché visitare
il sito internet dell'editore.
Come accennato, Google non richiede alcuna autorizzazione al linking ai contenuti degli
editori: esiste solo una possibilità di opt-out per chi è stato inserito nel sistema.
A seguito della indagine italiana dell'Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato
(AGCM) di cui al procedimento A/420 avviato ai sensi dell'art. 14 della legge n. 287/90, con
delibera del 26 agosto 2009, Google ha presentato all'Autorità stessa l'impegno di mantenere
"in aggiunta al meccanismo di esclusione da Google News attraverso il Centro assistenza, un
ulteriore meccanismo (quale il crawler distinto per Google News che è stato introdotto in
data 2 dicembre 2009) che consenta agli editori di escludere i propri contenuti da Google
News senza che tale scelta determini alcun effetto sull'inclusione degli stessi contenuti nel
motore di ricerca generale di Google".
A seguito del procedimento l'AGCM ha inoltre ritenuto opportuno inviare una segnalazione al
Governo ed al Parlamento chiedendo una revisione della normativa nazionale a tutela del
diritto d'autore, adeguandola alle innovazioni tecnologiche ed economiche del web.
In particolare, l'Autorità ha ritenuto indispensabile sciogliere il nodo dell'adeguata
remunerazione dell'attività delle imprese che producono contenuti editoriali online per lo
sfruttamento economico delle proprie opere da parte di altri soggetti.
Fedoweb, condividendo la posizione dell'AGCM, ha altresì più volte evidenziato che gli
impegni presentati da Google sono di per sé misure insufficienti a porre rimedio alle condotte
anticoncorrenziali e in violazione dei diritti d'autore degli editori.
Infatti, l'eventuale scelta dell'editore di avvalersi del diritto di opt-out da Google News
comporta per esso conseguenze pregiudizievoli in termini di visibilità sul motore di ricerca,
che, come noto, è il più utilizzato dagli utenti italiani (e non solo), con una quota di mercato
pari ad oltre il 90%.
Semplici indagini empiriche sono infatti in grado di dimostrare che le notizie del servizio
Google News sono sistematicamente favorite all'interno del motore di ricerca Google Search,
sia in termini di posizionamento (ranking) nella lista dei risultati delle ricerche sia in termini
di visibilità rispetto a tutti gli altri risultati.
Ne consegue che, qualora un editore decidesse di avvalersi del diritto di opt-out fornito da
Google, questi subirebbe conseguenze fortemente pregiudizievoli in Google Search, essendo

                                                                                               12
le notizie dell'editore precedute dai risultati di Google News che peraltro sono anche
presentati in modo più attraente (beneficiando di caratteristiche grafiche migliorative, quali la
presenza di immagini, che connotano le "notizie" aggregate di Google News).
Tale discriminazione, in considerazione della posizione nettamente dominante di Google nel
mercato italiano (e non solo) dei motori di ricerca, comporterebbe di fatto una sostanziale
"scomparsa" degli articoli dell'editore dal mondo di internet con gravissime ripercussioni
negative in termini di calo di traffico degli utenti dal proprio sito internet e quindi di
diminuzione degli introiti della pubblicità online.
Google, dunque, induce de facto gli editori a non avvalersi del diritto di opt-out da Google
News per non essere pregiudicati in Google Search.
A quanto precede, si aggiunga peraltro che Google News è un servizio di rassegna stampa
realizzato per fini di lucro: Google News produce infatti introiti pubblicitari tramite i link
sponsorizzati di Ad Words (il sistema pubblicitario di Google integrato con tutti i servizi
forniti dallo stesso, tra cui appunto Google News). Si tratta di un sistema paradossale che
consente a Google, tramite il sistema del linking, di sfruttare i contenuti degli editori e
guadagnare ingenti somme di denaro, senza tuttavia riconoscere alcun diritto d'autore né
alcuna remunerazione agli editori.
Come già segnalato, ribadiamo che quanto sopra esposto è solo un esempio di sfruttamento
illecito, che comporta notevolissimi danni economici alla industria editoriale online,
minandone la capacità di poter remunerare adeguatamente la propria attività e
conseguentemente la propria indipendenza e sopravvivenza.
Nel citato caso Google, l'AGCM ha infatti riconosciuto tale situazione di incertezza ed ha
infatti ribadito la necessità di un intervento del parlamento e delle autorità politiche nazionali
ed internazionali per superare l'oggettivo squilibrio tra il valore che la produzione dei
contenuti editoriali genera per il sistema internet nel suo complesso e i ricavi che gli editori
online sono in grado di percepire dalla propria attività.
Il lavoro della Commissione Europea conseguente alla presente consultazione dovrebbe
quindi costituire l'occasione per fare chiarezza sul tema del linking e affermare il principio
secondo cui il link alla notizia contenuta su pagine interne del sito internet dell'editore
(accompagnato o meno dalla pubblicazione di un estratto della notizia stessa) debba
necessariamente essere autorizzato dall'editore.
A tal proposito significativo è il recente esempio tedesco. In data 1 Marzo 2013, il Parlamento
tedesco (Bundestag) ha approvato una legge in materia di cosiddetto "Diritto d'autore
secondario" (ancillary copyright). La nuova normativa prevede il diritto esclusivo degli
editori di pubblicare i propri contenuti a fini commerciali, tutelandoli pertanto dalle pratiche
di linking dei motori di ricerca e altri aggregatori. Questi ultimi saranno infatti tenuti ad
acquistare i diritti di linking/pubblicazione dei contenuti dagli editori.
                                             *****
Sotto altro profilo, si deve altresì evidenziare come il tema del linking abbia creato incertezze
sulla linea di confine tra esercizio del diritto di cronaca e contributory infringement.
In particolare, nel 2013 alcuni Tribunali italiani hanno adottato decisioni che qualificano
come contributory infringement condotte (realizzate tramite linking) che in realtà apparivano
costituire estrinsecazione del diritto di cronaca.
A tal proposito, segnaliamo una recente decisone del Tribunale di Roma (ordinanza n. 15055
del 16 luglio 2013 nel caso Reti Televisive Italiane / Luca Sofri).
                                                                                               13
La vicenda nasce dalla pubblicazione, in prossimità dei maggiori eventi calcistici, di una
notizia con la quale si informavano gli utenti su quali canali (Sky e Mediaset) vedere le
partite, seguita dal seguente inciso: "ci sono anche molti streaming disponibili online,
segnalati su siti internet del quale non è possibile verificare la legalità delle trasmissioni".
Tale inciso conteneva un link a un precedente articolo della testata (pubblicato nel febbraio
2013) in cui si indicavano nominalmente i siti che pubblicavano illecitamente partite in
streaming. Nello stesso articolo si dava inoltre atto delle indagini giudiziarie avviate per
reprimere tale fenomeno.
Il Tribunale di Roma ha stabilito che, benché l'articolo in materia di diffusine in streaming
delle partite di calcio costituisca un legittimo esercizio del diritto di cronaca e di
informazione, il sistematico rinvio mediante il link all'articolo contenente il nome dei siti che
pubblicavano le partite in concomitanza con gli eventi sportivi avesse l'effetto di offrire al
pubblico uno strumento per l'immediata e facile individuazione dei siti illegali ove era
possibile vedere gratuitamente gli eventi.
Il giudice ha così inibito al direttore del giornale - quale concorrente nella violazione dei
diritti di Retei Televisive Italiane - di fornire espresse indicazioni sulla denominazione e la
raggiungibilità del portali telematici che, direttamente o indirettamente, consentivano di
accedere ai contenuti in violazione.
Alla luce di quanto precede, una riflessione sul tema del linking non dovrebbe prescindere
dalle sue ripercussioni sul diritto di cronaca (che sono sempre più frequenti). Non appare
infatti corretto che il semplice link a un articolo in cui si indicano le denominazioni di siti web
illegali fornito nell'ambito di un contenuto giornalistico costituisca un caso di contributory
infringement. Sarebbe quindi opportuno che la Commissione Europea considerasse la
tematica e fornisse i propri chiarimenti; il tutto nel chiaro interesse della certezza del diritto
per gli operatori dell'informazione che, alla luce dell'evoluzione giurisprudenziale, non sono
spesso in grado di verificare se la pubblicazione di un link sia una condotta lecita o meno.
Naturalmente, non si vuole negare in termini assoluti il fatto che il linking possa configurare
una fattispecie di contributory infringement. Vi sono infatti casi in cui è corretto che il linking
sia sanzionato come condotta agevolatrice della violazione di diritti d'autore altrui.
Sul punto, si segnala a titolo esemplificativo un precedente del Tribunale di Milano (sentenza
n. 3639 del 20 marzo 2010) nella controversia avviata da Sky Italia nei confronti del titolare
del sito www.tvgratis.net.
In quel caso, Sky Italia aveva acquistato dalle squadre di calcio italiane i diritti per la
trasmissione delle partite del campionato e aveva concesso a terzi, tra cui alcune aziende
cinesi, il diritto alla ritrasmissione delle partite su varie piattaforme, con l'esclusione del
mezzo internet. Tuttavia, alcuni siti web cinesi trasmettevano in streaming gli eventi sportivi.
Il sito italiano www.tvgratis.net, al fine di permettere all'utente di visionare le partite,
pubblicava (i) un elenco di link a siti che offrivano software necessari per la visione delle
partite (con istruzioni in italiano per l'installazione e l'esecuzione dei programmi), (ii) una lista
delle partite di calcio al momento visibili in rete e dei relativi siti, (iii) le istruzioni per
sincronizzare le immagini delle partite a una telecronaca in lingua italiana.
Il Tribunale di Milano ha ritenuto che sussistesse una responsabilità in capo al proprietario del
sito www.tvgratis.net per il contributo fattivo e rilevante all'illecita diffusione del materiale
protetto, in quanto trattavasi di condotta "specificamente destinata a consentire con evidente e
maggiore facilità all'utente italiano la possibilità di usufruire di tali contenuti".

In questo caso, la decisione del Tribunale di Milano non appare in contrasto con l'esercizio del
diritto di cronaca (si trattava infatti di un contenuto avente il chiaro intento di fornire agli
utenti indicazioni per violare i diritti di Sky Italia).

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)19. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)20. This raises difficult questions,

19
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
20
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              15
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased

La Direttiva 2001/29/EC è chiara nello stabilire che il principio dell'esaurimento si applicha
solo al diritto di distribuzione e non anche ai diritti di comunicazione al pubblico e messa a
disposizione del pubblico.
In primo luogo, Fedoweb è a favore di tale principio. In secondo luogo, ad avviso di
Fedoweb, tale principio dovrebbe essere interpretato restrittivamente, soprattutto alla luce del
noto caso UsedSoft (citato nella nota n. 20).
Il caseo UsedSoft ha dimostrato che il concetto di distribuzione, come interpretato dalla Corte
di Giustizia dell'Unione Europea, è troppo ampio se applicato al contenuto distribuito in
forma digitale, tanto che i confini tra il diritto di distribuzione e il diritto di messa a
disposizione del pubblico appaiono sfuocati.
Esiste attualmente un dibattito giuridico sul fatto se, alla luce delle particolari disposizioni di
cui alla Direttiva Software, la giurisprudenza UsedSoft si applichi solo al software o anche a
ogni altra forma di contenuto. Il Tribunale tedesco della città di Bielefeld ha deciso di non
applicare la giurisprudenza UsedSoft in un caso riguardante la rivendita di e-books alla luce
del fatto che la Direttiva Software costituirebbe lex specialis rispetto alla più generale
Direttiva 2001/29/EC, ritenendo quindi che il diritto di distribuzione online non fosse soggetto
al principio dell'esaurimento. Un approccio simile è stato seguito anche negli Stati Uniti: nel
caso Capitol Records LLC v ReDigi, Inc. (Case 1:12-cv-00095-RJS) è stato deciso che la
dottrina della "first sale" non è applicabile al contenuto distribuito in forma digitale.
Chiaramente, alla luce della giurisprudenza UsedSoft, è imperativo un chiarimento da parte
delle istituzioni europee, nel senso di stabilire che l'esaurimento dei diritti d'autore non si
verifica nel mondo online.
Si tratta infatti di un caso in cui il mondo online non è paragonabile al mondo offline, e ciò
per almeno due ragioni.
In primo luogo, mentre la rivendita di un oggetto fisico (ad esempio, una rivista) implica
necessariamente che il venditore si spogli del possesso dell'oggetto in favore dell'acquirente,
così non è nel mondo digitale. Una copia digitale può infatti rimanere in possesso del


                                                                                                16
venditore ed è praticamente impossibile obbligare il venditore a cancellare tale copia e,
soprattutto, verificare che il venditore lo abbia effettivamente fatto (c.d. "forward and delete").
In secondo luogo, l'applicazione del principio dell'esaurimento dei diritti nel mondo digitale
avrebbe effetti dirompenti sulla capacità degli editori di vedere remunerati i propri
investimenti e così di investire in nuovi contenuti. L'applicazione di tale principio, infatti,
comporterebbe la nascita immediata di un mercato secondario di opere digitali "usate" a costo
inferiore rispetto alle opere digitali "nuove", con l'importante specificazione che la copia
digitale "usata" è identica, in tutto e per tutto, a quella "nuova" (si tratterebbe quindi di una
concorrenza imbattibile). Come è noto, infatti, nel mondo digitale il contenuto non si deteriora
nel tempo (come invece può avvenire per un oggetto fisico, come ad esempio un libro, per il
quale quindi sarebbe giustificato un prezzo minore rispetto al nuovo). Se, nello stesso
momento in cui il nuovo contenuto è pubblicato dal titolare dei diritti, l'utente può acquistare
lo stesso identico prodotto a metà del prezzo, perché dovrebbe rivolgersi al titolare dei diritti?

C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute21. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered22.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?

   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
22
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             17

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed23, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database24 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition25 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub26 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
Ad avviso di Fedoweb, l'Unione Europea dovrebbe avere un ruolo di primo piano, anche a
livello internazionale, nella promozione dell'uso degli identifiers.
Gli identifiers, come mezzo associato a un'opera che fornisce informazioni sul titolare dei
diritti e i limiti di utilizzo concessi dal medesimo titolare, costituiscono infatti quel necessario
collegamento (oggi mancante) tra il titolare dei diritti e l'utilizzatore dell'opera protetta (sia
esso un consumatore o fornitore di servizi online).
Chiaramente, per essere funzionali allo scopo, gli identifiers dovrebbero rispondere ad alcuni
requisiti minimi: in primo luogo, dovrebbero essere oggetto di un processo di
standardizzazione tecnico in modo che possano essere "compresi" dalla maggior parte dei
software e motori di ricerca in circolazione; in secondo luogo, la standardizzazione dovrebbe


23
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

riguardare anche il contenuto degli identifiers così da ulteriormente facilitare il processo di
licensing dei contenuti.

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention27 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

environment?

     II.      Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC28.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law29. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

                                                                                                              19
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 30, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional31, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")32.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving33 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions34. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive35.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these

works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
       – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on

                                                                                           23
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
                                                                                          24
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?

activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?

                                                                                             25
4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other36. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)37.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
37
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             26

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC38 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC39 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC40 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 41.

The Marrakesh Treaty42 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics43 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders

43
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              30
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”44. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs45. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions46.




45
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

 III.          Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying47. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies

made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees4849.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions50 in the digital environment?

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments53.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
        – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

     IV.       Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers54 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 55. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?

     V.      Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE56 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text57. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose58. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure59. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
           – Please explain


56
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
57
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
58
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
59
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           38

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?

protection of private life and protection of personal data?

    VI. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?


                                                                                           39
79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
