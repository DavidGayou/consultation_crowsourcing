to be replaced"




                             Geschäftsführer: Graham Holmes ·Registergericht München, HRB 72265·Sitz München
                                                                1




Hardware based copyright levies cannot work anymore and need to be replaced

The questions raised in connection with (the compensation for) private copying are missing the most
fundamental and, thus, important item: Are hardware based levies a suitable tool which can work at all in the
digital area anymore?1

Nearly all companies involved in the calculation and payment of levies and copyright levy experts who have to
deal with levies on a day-to-day basis have realized that the system is broken, unfair, inefficient, and does not
work. Structurally, a system seeking compensation of right holders from end-users through device/media based
levies cannot work in the digital and cloud age. It will never do, and working on symptoms will not help. It must
be abolished (and may be replaced by another system if a flat compensation next to individual licensing is still
appropriate at all). This is clear for a variety of reasons:

1.       Business versus consumers

         It is mandatory under EU law (cf. CJEU judgments C-467/08 - Padawan, ground 2, recital 48; C-462/09 -
         Stichting de Thuiskopie, recital 28; and C-521/11 - Amazon.com International Sales, recital 25) and national
         constitutional laws that levy debtors (the hardware manufacturers, importers and/or dealers as applicable
         under local law) must be able to include the levy into the price of only those products which are purchased
         by private end-users who benefit from the private copying. There must be a distinction made between
         private and business end-users, and products sold to business end-users must not be subjects to the levies
         applied to products sold to private end-users (GEU judgments C-467/08 - Padawan, ground 3, recital 53
         and C-521/11- Amazon.com International Sales, recital 28 et seq.).2 Levies can only be collected forthose
         products which are purchased by private end-users who benefit from the private copying.

         Under local laws, levy debtors are manufacturers, importers and/or dealers. In practice, collecting societies
         usually approach local manufacturers or importers. However, with the rather rare exceptions of direct sales
         and project business, manufacturers and importers do not know which kind of end-users will finally
         purchase the product. The products that they sell enter the stream of commerce and can be re-sold several
         times before being purchased by the final user. This means that downstream visibility of the final user is
         limited or non-existent. In this situation, it is impossible to predict the type of final user. Obviously, simply
         including an average levy amount (between business and consumer levy) into the sales price of all products
     - is not a solution-because this leads to the illegal effect (addressed in the CJEU's Padawan ruling) that
         private end-users pay too less and business end-users pay too much.



1 This   statement deals with the compensation for digital copying, not for reprographic copying. However, even for the latter
hardware based levies are not suitable and not needed in modern times anymore. An operator levy (i.e. a levy on operators
of photocopier shops etc.), if at all, would be sufficient.

2 This   is undisputed; even the collecting societies now agree that European law requires a distinction. Disputed between the
industry and the collecting societies is only (i) whether business end-users shall pay no levy (industry view and what the
•EU judgments mandate) or a lower levy (collecting societies view), and (ii) how the distinction shall be made.
                                                             2




       The required distinction can therefore only be implemented at the point of sales, i.e. levy debtors may
       only be the last commercial seller of the product, but not be previous resellers, distributors, importers and
       manufacturers.3 A hardware based levy can accordingly only work in compliance with the required
       business-consumer distinction under European law if it is a point-of-sale levy. However, for the reasons set
       out below even such levy cannot legally work.

2.     Product innovation cycles vs. litigation cycles

       It is mandatory under EU law (cf. CJEU judgments C-467/08 - Padawan, ground 2, recitals 48 et seq.; C-
       462/09 - Stichting de Thuiskopie, recital 28 et seq. and C-521/11- Amazon.com International Sales, recital
       25 et seq.) and national constitutional laws that the hardware manufacturers, importers and dealers - as
       intermediaries who do not undertake the private copying - must be able to pass through the levies. The
       financial burden for levies must not be beard by the hardware industry, but by the end-users who benefit
       (cf. GEU judgments C-467/08 - Padawan, recital 48; C-462/09 - Stichting de Thuiskopie, recital 28; and C-
       521/11 - Amazon.com International Sales, recitals 25 et seq.). This is not at all the case in practice because
       the application of levies on the merits and, if any, the applicable usually are only decided a long time after
       the product has been sold which makes it impossible to include the appropriate amount in the sales price
       and pass it through.

       By way of a few examples only: (i) there is still a still a litigation pending on copyright levy claims for PCs
       and printers in Germany for the years 2001 onwards, i.e. 13 years after they have been sold, (ii) there has
       not even a judgment of the court of first instance been rendered yet on copyright levy claims for mobile
       phones in Germany for the years 2004 onwards, ten years after the sale, (iii) after the German collecting
       societies never issued a tariff or other fixed claim towards the levy debtors on hard disc drives before, they
       issued a tariffin 2011 out of the blue, claiming amounts never mentioned before retroactively from 2008,
       this case just reached the court of first instance; (iv) in Austria, the highest Austrian court confirmed already
       in 2005 (Austrian Supreme Court, judgment of 12.07.2005, 4 Ob 115/05y - Gericom) that no levy shall be
       applied on PCs/internal hard discs, but now, nearly 9 years later decided to reconsider its judgment (cf.
       Austrian Supreme Court, judgment of 17.12.2013,4 Ob 138/13t); (v) in Spain, many companies paid levies
       for many years (whereas other did not), just to learn that the Spanish system was not legal and there was
       no payment obligation; (vi) in France, the French upper administrative court issued a judgment stating that
       the tariffs are illegal, but still obliged the manufacturers to pay a levy for an interim period based on an
       illegal tariff (French Conseil d'Etat, decisions of 17.06.2011№324816, 325439, 325463, 325468 and
       325469). There are many more examples.

       To a certain degree, this is the fault of collecting societies who often take many years until they decide to
       claim levies and, then, retroactively apply the levy to a product already on the market for a long time. For
       obvious reasons, this practice of retroactively applying levies is clearly unjust and should be absolutely
       prohibited.

3   António Vitorino, Recommendation resulting from the Mediation on private copying and reprography levies, 31.01.2013,
p.12 et seq.
                                                                3




         However, putting this issue aside, there is a systematic problem which cannot be cured. Other than in the
         analogue age in the 1960's when levies were invented, there are new products, business models and
         technologies on the market every year. Whether the levy amounts for a new product are set by the EU,
         member state bodies, specific bodies, or (worst) collecting societies themselves4, there must always be an
         effective legal possibility to challenge the levies in a constitutional legal system. It is no option to evaluate
         the hardware based levy system on the assumption that there is a possibility to set levies which nobody will
         be willing and will need to challenge. This will never be the case in practice; and it would not be
         constitutional.

         Even in the most efficient member state court systems, it takes many years to get a final and binding
         judgment of the highest court. In some cases it takes even much more than ten years. This means that only
         after a product has been launched and sold for 5-15 years the levy debtors will know which amount they
         should have added to the sales prices over the past 5-15 years. By this time, some of the products will not
         be sold anymore and some companies (levy debtors) may not even exist anymore. Even with respect to
         those products still sold, for 5 to 15 years the industry either included a hypothetical, too high amount
         (which will lead to too high and thus illegal charges to end-users) or a hypothetical, too low or no amount
         (which means that they have to illegally burden the financial consequences). Even reducing litigation times
         to 2-3 years (which is not realistic) would not solve the issue. In other words: As law of nature, the system
         cannot work in countries which guarantee respect for effective legal procedures. Only a compensation
         system which is not based on ever evolving and changing products could work. This cannot be hardware
         levies.

3.   Cloud and streaming age

     Just looking at the products currently on the market where levies are disputed (majority of the products,
     including PCs, tablets, mobile phones, hard discs, set-top-boxes, USB sticks and memory cards), it will still
     take many many years until there will be the required certainty on (i) which products are subject to levies in
     which countries at all, and (ii) which amounts apply. By that time, the amount private copying done on
     hardware purchase by private end-users will be minimal or non existing. Already now, there is a strong
     movement to cloud services and streaming offerings. It does not make sense, is not in the interest of
     creators, and not fair to consumers and the hardware industry to invest time and resources to keep a
     system alive which does not work already today and which has no future.

4.   Inefficiencies and unequal treatment; unfairness to creators and consumers

     Irrespective of the non-curable issues mentioned above, a system where all involved parties (hardware
     industry, collecting societies, right holders organized in collecting societies) have to re-negotiate levies
     (collecting societies and industry) and the sharing of levy revenues (collecting societies amongst themselves


4 Levy   amounts unilaterally set by collecting societies lead to astronomic claims (such as 36 EUR for mobile phones in
Germany) which only serve as pressure for negotiations, but are never intended or possible to be reached. Obviously, such
moon tariffs cannot be used by any company to include a reasonable levy into the sales price.
                                                                4




         and with right holders) every year due to the launch of new products, the changing use of one product (or
         even only one parties view that the use has changed5) and/or a new court judgment can never be efficient.
         This process automatically leads to levy amounts to be finally paid by consumers which are too high and/or
         profits from levy claims to be given to creators and right holders which are too low. The German ICT
         industry association BITKOM has calculated that in Germany a typically equipped household would have to
         spend EUR 396.04 if the levy rates claimed by the German collecting societies are applied, irrespective of
         whether it undertakes any private copying at all.6

         In addition, the collecting societies never approach all debtors, but usually focus on local (not foreign) and
         large (not small) manufacturers, importers and dealers. To be fair, with new products and players on the
         market every year, this is unavoidable to a certain extent. The result however is that the end-users of some
         products and some brands do not pay whereas others (over)pay. This is again the logical consequence of
         trying to transfer a system created for the analogue age into the fast moving digital and cloud age.

5.      Multifunctional use; unfairness to consumers and end-users

         When levies were introduced in the 1960's on analogous audio and video recorders, there was the
        assumption that nearly every purchaser of analogous audio and video recorder used the product for private
        copying.7 It was viewed as fair to burden the purchasers of such analogue hardware with the increase of
        the product sales price by the levy amount. This private copying assumption for analogue hardware is not
        at all true anymore for the vast majority of digital products for which levies are claimed today. PCs, tablets,
        phones, hard disc drives, memory cards, USB sticks etc. are used for various purposes, most are irrelevant
        for levies. The assumption that a hardware based levy is a proper vehicle to reach those consumers who
        undertake private copying is clearly not correct anymore. The only fair system is direct consumer


5 In   2005 the Austrian Supreme Court decided that no copyright levies are due for PCs as they are not used for private
copying to a relevant extent (cf. Austrian Supreme Court judgment of 12.07.2005,4 Ob 115/05y - Gericom). In 2010 the
Austrian collecting societies claimed once again copyright levies on PCs stating that the use of PCs for private copying shall
have increased. After the claims have been dismissed in the first two instances, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the
case back to the lower courts for further fact finding in order to assess whether the use of PCs for private copying has
changed as suggested by the collecting societies (Austrian Supreme Court, judgment of 17.12.2013,4 Ob 138/13t). In
Germany, collecting societies claim copyright levies (i) of up to EUR 2.56 per mobile phone sold until end of 2007, (ii)
between EUR 4.00 -11.00 per mobile phone sold between 2008 and 2010 and (iii) copyright levies between EUR 12.00 -
36.00 per mobile phone sold as of 2011(all claims are disputed and subject to court proceedings) asserting that the use of
mobile phones for private copying shall have increased during the years.

7 Cf.   expressly the reasoning of the German parliament when introducing levies in the new German Copyright Act in 1965 as
first country: "few exceptions", "unlikely that... never used [for private copying]", both referring not to a type of product,
but to every single unit and thereby every single end-user (see comments to art 54 in Drucksache IV/3401,14.05.1965,
Schriftlicher Bericht des Rechtsausschusses, http://www.urheberrecht.org/law/normen/urhg/1965-09-
09/materialien/zuds_IV_3401.php3#top).
                                                                  s




         licensing which can be controlled by the content providers. These remuneration systems are in use today
        by companies such as Apple and Spotify. Even an internet access levy for private households based on
         speed is fairer than a levy on PCs, phones or hard discs. Levies on PCs, phones or hard discs just financially
        burden every household regardless if they ever make a single private copying A flat charge on households is
        easier and also fairer because there is no link between the amount of PCs, phones or hard discs owned by a
        person and the amount of private copying.

In result, there are many reasons which make it mandatory to stop hardware based levies. If at all a flat
compensation system shall be kept8, other ways need to be explored such as a charge on free download or
streaming services9, a flat rate to be paid by every household 10, a levy on private internet access11, or a state
financed system. Any of these systems would cause less legal issues, and would be fairer, be more efficient,
more reasonable and more transparent than the current hardware levy system. Transparency of the costs to
end-users should also be the aim of the European Union.

Political pressure or difficulties of a system change do not justify keeping a system which, by nature of law,
cannot work in a constitutional and EU-law compliant manner, and in addition is inefficient for right owners and
unfair to consumers and end-users.

The European Commission must therefore urgently take steps to abolish the unfair, inefficient, illegal and
outdated hardware based levy system.




8   In our view, it should not be kept as the legal justification for its implementation in the analogous age (that copies cannot
be technically prevented and a flat compensation is better than no compensation) has gone and individual licensing models
are possible. If the content industry decides to sell products without DRM, this is their business decision which must not
lead to a burdening of the hardware industry or other intermediaries with a levy or other compensation system. If
politicians believe that creators are not sufficiently compensated, this has to be addressed in the relation between the
creator and the content industry respectively in copyright contract law, but not through the backdoor of flat compensations
to be claimed from of third parties.

9 The   providers of such services benefit from the free content as part of their business model. So, it is much fairer and
logical if they pay the compensation.

1Ď Such   system is already established and working in Germany for public broadcasting fees - households which do not have
the means to pay it can be released or subsidized by the respective member state.

11   This would have the disadvantage that again a third party is burdened. However, contrary to hardware based
levies, the legal issues do not exist (easy distinction business-consumers; no new products every year; cloud and
streaming does not make a difference; not unfair to end-users as system is efficient; different use can be
addressed by making the levy dependent on speed of internet access), and it could be applied in a fair and
transparent manner.
