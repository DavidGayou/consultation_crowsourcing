       I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law 1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive




1
    This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

                                                                                                        1
on Collective Rights Management 2 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services 3; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition 5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability 6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?

B.    Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC 8 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software 9 and databases 10.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders 11 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other

8
  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
9
  Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
10
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
11
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is

                                                                                                            4
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies 12, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission
– e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available –
and at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks 13. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public 14. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach15)
Cultural heritage institutions including libraries are increasingly asked to provide access
to cultural heritage across the entire EU. In the majority of cases works on the websites
of cultural heritage institutions are made available without territorial restrictions. There



referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
12
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
13
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
14
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
15
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

                                                                                                                 5
is substantial uncertainty about liability issues when making works available to
audiences in all of Europe.
The “country of origin” approach may facilitate that content needs only to be licensed in
the country where the library is established. The same should be true for the issue of
liability for acts of communication to the public; only the law of the country of origin
applies, whether it concerns copyright law, but preferably also criminal law et cetera.


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief 16)?
 YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

 NO
 NO OPINION

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
 YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU 17 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of

16
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                    6
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU 18 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
No, hyperlinking does not amount to a communication of the public within the meaning
of Article 3(1) of the InfoSoc Directive, see the opinion of the European Copyright
Society      on       the      CJEU        Case       C-466/12     (Svensson)     at
www.ivir.nl/news/European_Copyright_Society_Opinion_on_Svensson.pdf, and on
February 13 of this year the CJEU indeed ruled accordingly. Moreover, embedding does
not amount to a communication of the public for the same reason.



12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
Not, this is the case in general, based on the exception in Article 5(1) of the InfoSoc
Directive. Moreover, an analogue article should also be included in the Database
Directive and the Computer Programs Directive.


4.     Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article) 19. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution



18
   Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd). See also
http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.

   See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.

(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 20. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

C.       Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute 21. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered 22.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?


20
   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).
21
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
22
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                                8
YES

16.    What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
From the perspective of libraries and the Dutch cultural heritage institutions there are
a number of advantages: Such a system would increase the amount of information about
rights holders available to all types of users including cultural heritage institutions. One
of the biggest problems facing cultural heritage institutions attempting to make their
collections available online is the lack of comprehensive and easy (read automatically)
access information about the copyright status of works and the identity and location of
rights holders. Introducing a registration system on the European level would be a first
step in ensuring that such information is more readily available in the future.

To be useful such a system needs to record transfers of rights throughout the duration of
the copyright protection of the registered works. In addition a registration system must
be transparent and easy to use, so that it allows all types of rights holders (including
individual creators) to register their works. The system should also include information
on works that are out of copyright as a means to provide legal clarity for users of Public
Domain works.

On the more general level a registration system would decrease transaction costs and
improve the availability of rights information to all market participants. In particular a
registration system should be beneficial for right holders since it makes it easier for
interested parties to obtain permission for reuse of protected works and to comply with
copyright law. However, note that a registration system will not be able to retroactively
solve the existing problem with orphan works and mass digitisation (also see Questions
40 and 41).

17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]

As with any registration system, it may lead to possible inadequacies, and may increase
administrative workload.


18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
There could be several incentives for right holders to register their works. Policies could
be enacted whereby certain elements of copyright protection are only available to right
holders who have registered their works. In principle this could apply to any element of
copyright protection that is not required by the Berne Convention. In general terms, it
should be considered to make certain elements of copyright protection only available to
right holders who have registered their works in a publicly available registry. Such
elements could be the ability to collect royalties through collective rights management,
or the ability to start enforcement actions. In addition registration could be made a
prerequisite for prolonging copyright protection after an initial terms (much shorter
than the current term) that is granted automatically. Registration could be made a
prerequisite for prolonging copyright protection beyond the term the minimum term
                                                                                             9
required by the Berne Convention. All this, however, would require extensive
information to all potential stakeholders, so that:
a) the authors are able to exercise their rights and these rights are not usurped by those
who register first;
b) the public and the public-mission institutions can always control the veracity of the
information recorded (also see our response to Question 20).



D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 23, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database 24 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition 25 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub 26 is seeking to take such
identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated
licensing across different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
At the minimum the European Union should ensure two things: (1) that identifiers as
well as rights ownership and permission databases are based on open standards, that
they are available to all content creators and that they can be read by all market
participants free of charge. (2) the EU should also ensure that all identifiers as well as
rights ownership and permission databases are interoperable across all of Europe (and
beyond). As an example of good practice, see the Open Bibliographic Data Principles,
http://openbiblio.net/principles/.
Any system must be developed in a true multi stakeholder approach (e.g not only by
rights holders and intermediaries) and should be reflective of work already undertaken
(for example by Europeana). Rights ownership and permission databases in particular
must be publicly accessible via machine readable interfaces. They must also include the

ability to store information on out-of-copyright (Public Domain) and openly licensed
works, such as via Creative Commons licences.


E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention 27 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
From the perspective of libraries and cultural heritage institutions in the Netherlands
the current terms of copyright protection (including neighbouring rights protection) are
too long. Cultural heritage institutions hold large collections of works that are still under
copyright (or where the copyright status is unclear) but that are not exploited
commercially anymore. A term of protection of life plus 70 years stands in stark contrast
with the commercial life of the large majority of copyright protected works that much
shorter. As a result the disproportionate length of copyright protection prevents our
institutions from effectively fulfilling our public interest mission in the digital
environment.
In many cases the cost for digitisation of copyrighted works that are no longer in
commercial exploitation exceeds the potential economic value of these works. As a result
these are not made available online by the right holders or publishers who lack an
economic incentive. While cultural heritage institutions that own such works have an
incentive to make such works available (it is our public task to provide access to our
collections) they are confronted with costs for rights clearance that are prohibitively
high due to the required diligent searches for the right holder(s) of every work (often
heirs).
One of the outcomes of this is the existence of the so called ‘20th century black hole’
when it comes to online availability of copyrighted works. Works from the 20th century
are significantly less likely to be available than works from the centuries before (many of
which are clearly in the public domain) or from the 21st century (many of which are still
available commercially).
Shortening the term of protection will decrease the number of out-of-commerce works
that are in copyright and will thus reduce the scope of the problems outlined above.
Given this, the term of copyright protection should be reduced to the minimum
27
     Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.

                                                                                                                11
requirement established by the Berne Convention (life of the creator plus 50 years). This
could be a first step towards a more significant reduction of term of protection that
would require a revision of the Berne Convention; the European Union should work in
the relevant international fora to further reduce the term. This should include efforts to
agree on a system where extended copyright protection after an initial automatically
granted term would be only granted if the work is registered by the right holder. The
duration of the initial term should be brought into line with the duration of protection of
other IP rights such as patented inventions (20 years) databases (15 years) and
industrial design rights (25 years). Also compare the Lisbon Council Policy Brief by P.B.
Hugenholtz and I. Hargreaves:
www.ivir.nl/publications/hugenholtz/LisbonCouncil_policybrief.pdf.
In addition it should be examined if it is possible to establish a cut-off date for copyright
protection that ensures that all works published before that date are not protected by
copyright anymore. Such a cut-off date could vary by sector (European Film Heritage
institutions for example advocate 1920 as a cut-off date for cinematographic works).



     II.    Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC 28.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law 29. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations
and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a
normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 30, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional 31, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B") 32.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
The purpose of Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of
copyright and related rights in the information society was explicitly (as its title shows)
to create more harmonisation within the EU. Ironically, it ends in a situation of non-
harmonisation. Limitations and exceptions vary a lot from country to country. Only one
exception is mandatory today: the exception for temporary copies (whether this
could/should be regarded as an act of reproduction was also discussed at WIPO in
1996). In addition to this situation of non-harmonisation, the list of exceptions was made
exhaustive, so no exceptions could be adjusted or expanded to similar uses, and no new
exceptions could be added despite the fact that the world and the information market is
ever changing.
It is in the library’s missions to cooperate and share resources across borders. For the
European library community the existence of 28 different copyright regimes with their
own exceptions makes this cooperation more difficult. One example is that the definition
of “non-commercial” differs from country to country. For other differences see K.
Crews’ Study on Copyright Limitations and Exceptions for Libraries and Archives
written for WIPO at www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/sccr_17/sccr_17_2.pdf.
The current situation creates an uneven playing field. Users of the same type should be
able to enjoy the same exceptions (user rights) in all member states. Cultural Heritage
Institutions are increasingly working together on digitisation projects (for example in

32
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           13
the context Europeana) and the fact that the exceptions benefitting publicly accessible
libraries, museums and archives have not been implemented (uniformly) in all
member states, creates unnecessary uncertainties and disadvantages institutions in some
member states vis-a-vis institutions in others.
The 'New Renaissance' report on bringing Europe’s cultural heritage online specifically
recommended such collaborations between institutions. The lack of harmonization
introduces unnecessary friction costs for institutions engaging in cross border
collaborations.
The lack of harmonisation and the optional character of the list of exceptions creates an
ambiguous situation throughout the EU. Especially when several Member States work
together in cross-border projects such as:
-     Europeana and all the related projects whose missions are to give online access to
European Cultural Heritage;
-      the European Library;
-     the EU arctic centre, whose mission is, among others to develop knowledge and
spread information on the region http://www.arcticcentre.org/InEnglish/ABOUT-
US/EU-Arctic-Information-Centre or,
-      the Upper Rhin University;
-       All other cross-border projects shared by several Member States trying to pool
resources to the benefit of their population and to develop mutual understanding and
reciprocal knowledge. All those structures work with libraries that are supposed to give
access to their collection (including digital ones), but can be forbidden to do so because
of different copyright regimes and absence of harmonised exceptions in the respective
Member States. In addition, this lack of harmonisation is even more of an obstacle when
projects involve non-EU states.
The transition to digital services enables libraries and cultural heritage institutions to
collaborate across borders and make their collections available across all of Europe and
this needs to be mirrored by harmonising the exceptions benefitting these institutions.
The most comprehensive way to address this issue would be to establish a unified EU
copyright title (compare our response to Question 78).

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
All existing and additional exceptions for libraries museums and archives should be
made mandatory and non-overridable. They should be harmonised to the fullest extent
possible, after they have been broadened and new ones have been added in line with our
response here below. It is not acceptable that citizens in some Member States enjoy a
lesser level of access to the collections held by publicly funded libraries and cultural
heritage institutions simply because of an uneven implementation of exceptions from the
InfoSoc Directive. This issue becomes more pressing as more and more activities of these
institutions are taking place online. Moreover, a vitally important issue is that contracts
should not be able to override limitations and exceptions.
All the current exceptions in the InfoSoc Directive are drafted on the basis that they do
not interfere with the normal exploitation of the work and, therefore, do not

                                                                                        14
unreasonably prejudice right holders. This means that making them mandatory in all
Member States should have no negative effect on right holders, while in many cases this
will substantially benefit citizens and other public policy objectives such as access to
knowledge and culture or inclusive education. Moreover, the current exception for
libraries, archives and museums in Article 5(2)c is quite open in the way that it allows
“specific acts of reproduction made by publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments or museums, or by archives, which are not for direct or indirect
economic or commercial advantage”, but it is an exception for the reproduction right
only, and it does not cover any other library activity that would be considered fair use in
a more flexible legislation. One example is that the transmission of single scanned
articles or other pieces of information (like one single scanned poem) to individual users
or other libraries, on request, is considered as communication to the public and
therefore needs to be licensed. In the analogue world this is covered by an exception in
most countries. This is a case that in our opinion clearly would pass the three step test,
as it is a specific case and do not harm the interests of the author.
Additionally, to address technological change that has already occurred, the revised
Directive should include new mandatory exceptions. With regard to libraries the status
of e-lending should be clarified (see the answers to questions 37 and 38), possibly via a
new exception. Off-premises or remote access for registered users would be one of the
situations which also need to be covered by new exceptions. In addition, cultural
heritage institutions need to be enabled to make out-of-commerce works in their
collections available online for non-commercial purposes, by expanding the scope of the
existing provision in Article 5(3)n of the Directive. Thus, a functional exception (unlike
the one in the Orphan Works Directive) should be created for mass digitisation and
making available out-of-commerce works by libraries, archives and museums for non-
commercial purposes. Moreover, new exceptions are desirable for text and data mining,
for non-commercial sharing for protected works by individuals, for research and
education purposes, plus Open Access legislation. Finally, there is a need to introduce an
open     norm      (also   see    our     responses    to    Questions     32    to   34).



23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
All current existing exceptions must remain. We do not want to remove already existing
exceptions, only add new ones and find a more flexible solution than the current one. To
list any new specific exceptions that will take into account any new technological
development in years to come would not prove to be useful. The current list should
therefore be combined with more general principles like an open norm, “fair use” or
“similar use”.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
YES – Please explain why
There is indeed a need for more flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for
limitations and exceptions. The exceptions and limitations in the InfoSoc Directive were
not drafted in a technologically neutral manner which is problematic in times of
                                                                                        15
accelerated technological progress. We repeat the need for a more flexible and open
solution. Most exceptions are too narrow and specific, even for 2001 when they were
written. Also see the report of P.B. Hugenholtz and M.R.F. Senftleben, Fair Use in
Europe.    In    Search    of   Flexibilities. IViR,    Amsterdam,    available  at
www.ivir.nl/publications/hugenholtz/Fair%20Use%20Report%20PUB.pdf.
Copyright seeks to balance the rights of rights holders with those of users. This balance
has been damaged in the past years with only the rights holders benefiting. The main
objective of copyright reform at the European level should be to maintain those rights
and re-establish a new balance where innovation, research as well as legal access to
digital content will be encouraged. Therefore, Copyright law shall balance the right to
access, share and use copyrighted works with the author’s right to protection and
compensation.
Now we have a situation of imbalance, with the exhaustive list of non-mandatory
exceptions, increasing terms of protection (the last one was for sound recordings, in
2011), cumbersome, expensive and monopolistic licensing models for libraries for
electronic journals and books. Libraries have always been important contributors to the
revenues, especially for academic and research publishers, and are paying for what they
acquire. More generally, a recent press release of the British Library shows that “The
economic value that the library delivers is now almost five times its costs, representing a
return on investment of 5:1” and therefore that libraries, archives and information
services have an important role to play in boosting the economy. A competitive market
can only innovate by relying on well-educated and informed citizens and consistent
investment in libraries, archives and information services. This generates a good return
on investment and stimulates the economy.
However there is a need to establish fair conditions applying to libraries, archives and
cultural heritage institutions as a whole and not only to right holders. Rules that apply
in the commercial environment (especially for films and music) shall apply differently in
public institutions that do not seek a direct or indirect economic interest.
Compared to institutions in countries that have a more flexible approach to exceptions
and limitations European institutions face a competitive disadvantage. Compare for
example the scope of the Google Books project in the US and in Europe: in Europe
Google and the libraries are only digitising out-of-copyright works, while in the US the
project also includes in-copyright titles. As a result of the US fair use argument
(discussed in court), citizens of the US may well have better access to their recent (20th
century) culture than European citizens.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
The best approach would be one that provides built-in flexibility in reaction to new
technological developments or new forms of use. An open norm such as fair use fits this
description. It should be implemented EU-wide (see also answer to Question 22) and in
addition to (existing) targeted exceptions and limitations. As long as an open norm is

                                                                                            16
implemented EU wide its effect on the functioning of the single market would be
minimal while it can be expected to improve the competitive position of European
market actors vis a vis market participants in other jurisdictions that have an open
norm.
More reliance on court decisions may be a consequence of an open norm and more
flexibility in copyright legislation. Court decisions take time, but as more court decisions
are made, the pattern of the fair use concept becomes more predictable. Court cases
could however be extremely costly and should not be the only way of seeking for a
solution.
Creating new EU legislation would be even slower than court cases, especially, and
couldn’t reply immediately to the need for new exceptions and limitations as the need
arises. But the advantages of an ambitious legislative approach, open to keep pace with
social and technological changes would be a good sign of the European will to contribute
to the building of the 21st Knowledge Society and of the EU not willing to lag behind
American or Asian front runners.
A European Copyright Title could be one alternative.
A citizens’ initiative on the need for extensive exceptions and limitations for libraries,
archives and museums calling on the European Commission to make a legislative
proposal on this issue could be an option (albeit very challenging) (cf.
http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome).

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
At present, the EU only obliges its Member States to adopt one exception (regarding
temporary acts of reproduction), while the adoption of the others is optional. As a result,
something that is legal in one country could be illegal elsewhere. In digitisation and
online projects it is unclear whether certain national exceptions also apply in the
country of the partner institute. Many heritage institutions are faced with the fact that
right holders or CMOs are not willing to provide licences to participate in pan-
European projects such as Europeana.
Another example, the UK is the only Member State without a private copying exception,
so an act that is legal in Spain or the Netherlands suddenly becomes a criminal offence
in the UK. Finland hardly has a parody exception, so a work considered legal in
Germany could be infringing copyright in Finland. From a research perspective, this
means that researchers have difficulties working together and sharing knowledge across
borders. Currently, for example, inter-library loans are hampered across borders.
Right owners and service providers based in stricter jurisdictions often do not accept the
wider scope of freedoms in other jurisdictions and attempt to limit it contractually or
use technical measures. Moreover, most licences impose the law of the state of the
publisher and not that of the subscribing institution, and this leads to the paradox that
publishers from different Member States are contractually not subject to national laws
(including exceptions to copyright) even if they are protected by copyright via national
laws. This, coupled with the fact that there cannot be a tender among several
competitors for the provision of copyright protected content that can be provided just
by a single company, often makes it difficult for libraries to obtain licences really

                                                                                          17
suitable to their needs, even when their national legislation (copyright law, contract law,
public procurement law, privacy law, etc.) could provide solutions.



27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
Fair compensation could be regulated within the country of origin. The concept of fair
compensation should include that in some cases a fair compensation also can be no
compensation. Compensation schemes with a legal basis should be based only on uses
where there is clear evidence that it harms the author’s economic rights, also compare
the CJEU’s decision in Case C-271/10 (VEWA/Belgium).



A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving 33 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions 34. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive 35.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
The Netherlands have implemented Article 5(2)c of the InfoSoc Directive as a narrow
preservation exception in the Dutch Copyright Act (article 16n). This exception sums up
three specific permitted acts of reproduction: restoration, preservation of works under
threat of decay, and format shifting in case software formats become inaccessible.
However, these narrowly defined acts of reproduction do not fully cover the needs of
libraries and other cultural heritage institutions in the digital environment. Firstly, they
wish to be able to digitize works for preventive purposes before they show signs of
decay, in case harm might be done to their collections (compare the Cologne archive
which collapsed into a metro tunnel). Libraries and other heritage institutions should
thus be allowed to digitize not only materials that ‘threaten to decay’, but their entire
collections to prevent any item from loss – regardless the present condition. As format
shifting is concerned, the Dutch exception is worded too restrictively, given that the
preservation of e.g. older computer games requires not just format shifting of the work
itself but also the format shifting and emulation of both the hardware and software
required for keeping the work accessible.
Secondly, libraries also want to digitize works in their collections to be able to better
fulfil their missions. Digital copies of cultural heritage works provide many advantages
such as being (automatically) indexable, being easier to access and having lower storage
costs. The current Dutch implementation of article 5(2)c of the InfoSoc Directive does
not allow institutions to structurally create digital copies of works in their collection.
This prevents institutions from fully realising the potential inherent to digitisation of
their collections. This is highly detrimental in an environment where, as the 'New
Renaissance' report puts it, “digitization is more than a technical option, it is a moral
obligation”. In addition recital 40 of the Directive which states that 'Such an exception
or limitation should not cover uses made in the context of online delivery of protected
works or other subject-matter' is highly problematic. As online communication of
works to the public becomes more and more important for cultural heritage
institutions, limiting the reproduction exception in such a way is simply anachronistic as
it prevents institutions from using digitized works in a meaningful way.
Thirdly, technological measures and their relationship with the exceptions benefitting
cultural heritage institutions are highly problematic: often CDs and DVDs are protected
by technological measures, the removal of which would require the cooperation of the
producer. Art. 6 of the Infosoc Directive provides that technological protection measures
are protected per se, independently on the scope of protection, entrusting to voluntary
agreements or to subsidiary interventions of Member States the adoption of appropriate
measures to ensure that legitimate users can make effective use of licensed content.
These measures are lacking in most Member States, to the detriment of libraries.
In order to answer even more precisely:
(a) Print and analogue materials. The digitization for preservation purposes carried out
by publicly accessible cultural institutions is implicitly included among the specific acts
of reproduction referred to in Article 5(2)c of the InfoSoc Directive. In addition, the EU

                                                                                         19
has repeatedly recommended the adoption of national policies encouraging the
digitization of cultural heritage. However, this exception is optional and it has been
generally implemented in very narrow terms, so that, in many member states, even
format shifting for preservation purpose is still prohibited, or limited to specific formats
and/or number of copies.
(b) Digital materials fixed on support. CDs and DVDs are often protected by
technological measures (TPM). The removal of TPM would require the cooperation of
the producer. Art. 6 of the InfoSoc Directive provides that technological protection
measures are protected per se, independently on the scope of protection, entrusting to
voluntary agreements or to subsidiary interventions of Member States the adoption of
appropriate measures to ensure that legitimate users can make effective use of licensed
content. The strength of the protection of TPMs compared with the weakness of the
provision in favor of legitimate uses has led in many Member States to the absence of
effective guarantee for legitimate users, including libraries. As a result, many libraries
are not able to reproduce CDs and DVDs legally acquired. These materials will become
unusable due to technological obsolescence in a few years.
(c) Subscribed online content. In the case of online works there is no balance at all. All
the weight is on the side of the copyright holders only. Indeed the exception provided by
Art. 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29 does not apply because, according to Art. 6 of the
Directive, it cannot be provided any obligation to the removal of TPM to the benefit of
beneficiaries of exceptions for "works or other subject-matter made available to the
public on agreed contractual terms in such a way that members of the public may access
them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them". While the exclusive
distribution right is exhausted by the first sale in EU, so that print materials can enter
permanently into the library collection, most content provided online are offered as
temporary services, ceasing upon the expiry of the subscription. In such cases, library
will have to pay again every year to ensure access to those content. In many cases, even
when licenses provide for a perpetual right of access in favor of the library and its users
(“post-termination clause”), libraries cannot obtain back-up files for conservation, but
can only have access through the producer's website, who does not give guarantees for
long-term preservation. Few licenses only, negotiated by libraries or their consortia,
provide for the delivery of files for local hosting and preservation purposes. Some others
contain a simple obligation to transfer the files in case the company will not be able to
host them.
Although a single library does not have the means to ensure the long-term digital
preservation of large amounts of resources, and the payment of an annual fee could be
justified by the fact that publishers and other commercial providers bear the costs of
storage and management of digital content on their own platforms, Recital 16 of the
Commission Recommendation of 27 October 2011, shows that the problem is that: In
spite of progress made across the EU on the preservation of digital material, in several
Member States no clear and comprehensive policies are in place on the preservation of
digital content. The absence of such policies poses a threat to the survival of digitised
material and may also result in the loss of material produced in digital format (born
digital material). The development of effective means of digital preservation has far-
reaching implications that go beyond cultural institutions. Questions of digital
preservation are relevant for any private or public organisation, which is obliged or
which        wishes       to       preserve      digital      material       (http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:283:0039:0045:EN:PDF).


                                                                                         20
Libraries play an important role in the network of cultural heritage institutions in
charge of preserving nations’ history and archives. They play a specific role in the
literature and information sector by receiving in legal deposit, keeping and preserving,
buying, organizing, promoting and giving access to information books and literature as
a whole. Their mission is done on behalf of the general public, education and research.
Several issues are at stake now: private companies that license content do not have the
mission to defend or take into account the “public interest”, “education”, or “open
access to knowledge” in their business/licence models, so that:
-      economic sustainability of private companies that license content doesn’t offer
any long term guarantee;
-      the evolution of format leads to a quick obsolescence that needs public
infrastructure to act outside of economic interest to maintain national memories.
All these issues are implicitly defined missions and policy goals for many libraries, both
public and academic.


29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
An updated copyright framework is needed to ensure specific regulation for libraries
and other cultural institutions, and to secure their public mission.
Updating the copyright framework should be done in order that online content is not
considered a service. Under the current terms, the copyright framework considers
online content as a (just temporary) service. This creates a huge risk for libraries and
cultural heritage institutions, much higher than with print material, given the extreme
volatility and perishability of digital formats. It is a fact that long-term strategies such as
digital preservation and data curation are at present largely entrusted to the market and
its fluctuations which works quasi exclusively on a very short-term.

Libraries should be granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual right to archive
complete copies of subscribed online materials, and to use the archived materials in the
event that access on the original platform is discontinued or suspended. An exception
should ensure, at the request of the library, the availability of back-up files for long-
term preservation, regardless of the format of publication.

30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
From our perspective the best solution would be to broaden the existing exception in
Article 5(2) c of the InfoSoc Directive, so that it allows institutions to make
reproductions of all works in their collection as long as these are not intended for direct
commercial advantage. In line with our answer to Question 22 this exception should be
made mandatory for all Member States.
As the 'Study on the application of Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights
in the information society' (page 301) highlights, […] to make an exception mandatory
could apply in the case of article 5(2)(c), as the development of digital libraries is one of

                                                                                            21
the key objectives of the Digital Agenda, and the digitization of cultural heritage is
promoted by the Council and the Commission […]. Instead of only allowing specific acts
of reproductions it should allow all acts of reproduction necessary for publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments or museums, or by archives to achieve
aims related to their public-interest missions. This should include reproductions made
as part of mass digitization efforts, backup copies and reproductions for format shifting
and emulation. Such reproductions should be limited to use which is not for direct
commercial or economic advantage or use in line with other exceptions and limitations
allowed for by the directive (such as the broadened version of the exception foreseen in
Article 5(3)n that we propose in answer to Question 34). Additional benefits would be
increasing the operational efficiency and reducing costs of the beneficiary institutions.

Moreover, Article 6 of the InfoSoc Directive should be revised in order to enforce
exceptions and limitations and to ensure legitimate utilizations of protected works,
regardless of format or mode of dissemination.

The result of making mandatory both Art. 5(2)c and Art. 6 of the InfoSoc Directive is
that they would support the specific public mission and responsibility of libraries and
other cultural heritage institutions, that is different from most other users of
copyrighted material. Their main responsibility is to preserve, organise, make available,
and promote information and literature for the public interest. Short-term economic
interests should not limit long-term preservation of human’s cultural heritage.
Subscribed online content can escape libraries preservation schemes because of the
absence of specific exceptions, creating a huge risk of a 21st century black hole where a
large amount of content could disappear forever. Broadening the scope of the extension
along these lines mirrors the recommendations made as part of the European
Commission commissioned 'Study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC on
copyright and related rights in the information society' from December 2013.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?

                                                                                          22
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
Libraries are subject to complex and lengthy negotiations with publishers, database
vendors and right holders, impacting collection development, duration of access,
permitted uses. Libraries often entrust negotiation and management of contracts to
national or regional institutional consortia to increase their bargaining power. But the
use of consortia for the negotiations is a remedy, not an optimal solution, and the logic of
large numbers may introduce rigidities in pricing and business models, encouraging the
purchase or subscription of large packages of content (big deal) rather than the selection
of targeted works, a situation which is difficult to justify with all the extra public
finances spent. Currently there are gaps to be filled in the Directives (e.g. in InfoSoc and
Database Directives) and even more in national copyright laws. These gaps contribute to
enforce unbalanced power relations. Unbalanced power relations among right holders,
and between right holders and users do not contribute to establish an environment of
best practices for negotiation and contracts.

To be more precise on the current unsatisfactory situation, at present, licensing
practices are not satisfactory for the following reasons:

- Technical accessibility and interoperability: Format shifting and other adaptations
should be permitted not only for long-term preservation purposes, but also for remote
access when needed to ensure technical accessibility and usability by print impaired
people, or to effectively integrate acquired or licensed materials in Library information
systems, according to international standards of interoperability. But the copyright
holder or the database producer can refuse both to grant a special licence, and, in case
of born-digital content, to temporarily remove the technological protection measures in
order to facilitate the use, and often they refuse. It should be noted that TPMs protect
not only content, but also metadata related to those content, so that the legal protection
of TPMs affects also access and reuse of metadata for integration within library
catalogues and information discovery systems.

- Inter-Library Loan and Document Supply: Cooperation between cultural institutions
for the benefit of the public is explicitly encouraged by numerous international, national
and regional standards. Interlibrary Loan and Document Supply are typical library
services based on the temporary exchange of documents between a library A holding the
content a library B temporarily needing the content. As an internal activity between
libraries, interlibrary exchange should be totally irrelevant for the purposes of
protection of copyright. In the digital environment, such exchange requires transmission
in a network by an intermediary (eg. an internet provider and/or a service provider).
But there is uncertainty on these points: digital reproductions made by libraries for
inter-library exchange purposes can or cannot be considered as “specific acts” of
reproduction covered by Art. 5(2)c of the InfoSoc Directive? According to the InfoSoc

                                                                                          23
Directive (Art. 5(2)c and 5(1)), a digital reproduction made by the library "A" can or
cannot be sent electronically to the library "B", provided that copy will be used by the
library "B" for legitimate uses such as replacement of damaged parts of a volume in its
collection, or to give to an end-user a print copy within the limits of art. 5(2)b), or
communication by dedicated terminals within the (very strict) limits of art. 5(3)n, or
utilization for administrative procedures within the limits of Art. 5(3)e? An interlibrary
electronic exchange of protected works, or parts of them, can or cannot be considered
one of those "Temporary acts of reproduction” referred to in Article 5(1), “which are
transient or incidental [and] an integral and essential part of a technological process and
whose sole purpose is to enable: (a) a transmission in a network between third parties by
an intermediary, or (b) a lawful use of a work or other subject-matter to be made, and
which have no independent economic significance”, and therefore “exempted from the
reproduction right provided for in Article 2"? There are different interpretations on
this matter, and in most Member States there are no explicit exceptions for interlibrary
services. For online content subscribed by libraries, the interlibrary exchange is subject
to licences, and only few publishers allow such digital exchange.

- Remote access to born-digital content: From the perspective of Dutch public libraries,
the service to make copyright protected digital works available to registered users
outside of the walls of the library (‘home-access’) has hardly developed, contrary to the
situation of university libraries and libraries connected to education and research
institutes. Publishers, licensors and distributors of e-content are generally speaking very
reluctant to conclude any contractual agreements with generally accessible libraries,
museums, and archives with an ‘open users group’. Publishers, licensors and producers
refer to the risk of profit-decrease by effects of cannibalization. In turn, public libraries
refer to the positive effect that the making available of e-content by libraries may have
for market parties, among others by raising the interest for content with quality and
through product differentiation.

- Utilizations for distance learning courses and programmes: most publishers do not
allow the extraction and reuse of reasonable portions of protected works acquired or
subscribed by libraries or other cultural institutions and their communication to
registered users through e-Learning platforms. It is generally accepted that the
exception provided by Art. 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29/EC covers both face-to-face and
distance education, and that the fundamental rights it protects (freedom of expression,
right to be informed, right to learn) are of crucial importance. The enforcement of this
exception at European level, prohibiting its restriction by national legislations, or by
licences is of utmost importance.

- Open Access to research results: The Commission Recommendation of 17 July 2012 on
access to and preservation of scientific information, promotes the adoption by Member
States of policies that provide for the storage of the results of publicly funded research,
in online, open and free electronic infrastructures, which should be interoperable within
and outside the EU and suitable for long term preservation. Academic and research
libraries are directly involved in such activities: they are often responsible of their
parent institutional open access repositories. Other EU Recommendations require the
open access availability of articles and other publications which are the result of publicly
financed research, no later than six months after their publication. Some publishers
allow this practice to all their authors, others allow libraries to deposit just after long
negotiations, but the majority oppose clear refusal. There should be a legal instrument

                                                                                           24
enforcing – on one side - the right of authors in making their papers available to the
public for research and non-commercial purpose, and – on the other side – the right of
libraries or their parent institutions in collecting and making openly and publicly
available such content.

- Content mining: The potential of text and data mining for scientific research is huge,
and has been widely demonstrated. It is a process aimed to collect raw data (e.g., the
occurrence of words, figures etc. in a database), not creative expressions. Libraries are
interested in such utilization both for integrating content and metadata in their
catalogues and information systems, and for the benefit of their users. Undertaking text
and data mining of content to which researchers have already lawful access should be
considered a legitimate utilization, and should not be subject to re-license. But there is a
lack of legal certainty on this point, and most standard licences do not allow content
mining. As a consequence, in most cases researchers give up research, rather than
addressing high transaction cost, both direct (cost of re-licensing) and indirect (the time
needed to negotiate). For this, an exception should explicitly legitimate text and data
mining of content on which researchers have lawful access, for research and non-
commercial purpose.

- Post-termination access to online subscribed content: recalling our responses to
Questions 28-30, most licences do not provide any guarantee for access to subscribed
content after the termination of a licence. Such content is considered just as a temporary
service.
- Academic and research libraries have negotiated licenses for decades (even though the
above mentioned problems have been rather consistent over the years). Digital material
until now has to a large extent been focused on research and professional information
(mainly journals), reference and news, and not so much on books and mainstream
journals. Public libraries are a newcomer on this arena, due to the rapid development of
e-books for fiction and general/popular non-fiction. Access to e-material is usually
restricted to the inside of the premises of the library. Public libraries are therefore
facing the risk that their public service to society in the digital domain will not keep pace
with and meets the needs, questions and wishes of their users.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
It should be permitted for a library to provide remote access to copyright works in
digital form to which it has lawful access, to a registered user, also see Question 34.
Especially in view of public libraries, article 5(3)n of the InfoSoc Directive needs to be
extended in order that it allows institutions to make available their digital works and
other subject matter for private use via online remote access by their registered
individual users using an authentication system.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]


                                                                                          25
Especially in view of public libraries, article 5(3)n of the InfoSoc Directive needs to be
extended in order that it is not considered as an infringement of copyright:
- making works available for remote access for the user’s private use,
- by publicly accessible libraries and cultural institutions which do not envisage to
achieve a direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit,
- of a digital work (e-content) which is part of the collections of these institutions,
- to their registered, individual users,
- via an authentication system.

In the special case of out-of-commerce works, the exception in Article 5(3)n of the
InfoSoc Directive should allow libraries, museums and archives to make digital copies of
out-of-commerce works in their collections available for non-commercial purposes via
open electronic networks such as the internet.
In general, a reform of the InfoSoc Directive should clarify that every kind of utilization
made by libraries and cultural institutions for their public-interest mission is allowed,
no matter the medium of the transmission. Remote access should be allowed for all the
utilizations discussed above (see answers to Q32). Exceptions and limitations should
apply to online content as well as to analogue materials, and should be mandatory and
cannot be overridden by contracts or TPMs. Exceptions and limitations should be
flexible and updated to new emerging needs, introducing a general free use provision
additional to the exceptions and limitations expressly provided, as it has been suggested
with art. 16 of the IFLA Treaty Proposal (http://www.ifla.org/node/5858) and Article 5.5
of the European Copyright Code drafted by the Wittem Group. Such a general
provision should allow application by analogy of existing exceptions and limitations,
provided they are consistent with the concept of ‘fair practice’, and/or compliant with
the three-step-test, which presently is recalled by the InfoSoc Directive just to limit the
application of exceptions and limitations. Moreover, contracts should not override any
statutory provisions regarding the entry of a work into the public domain.

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?


                                                                                             26
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
YES – Please explain with specific examples
Currently, significant barriers can be observed both for public libraries and research
libraries: some publishers refuse to supply their products to libraries, or offer them at
higher prices compared to their print equivalents, or impose default selection such as
bundling, or remove content without informing the library. Moreover, multiple licences
and different use models create lack of clarity on the condition of access to content for
users. Deterioration of users’ rights is evident (e.g. crossing a border with a borrowed
book was not a problem). This is impossible with online access to a library across a
border; usually licenses will not in any case allow e-lending to other libraries or patrons
outside of the library’s defined population (e. g. municipality, university, college).
If licences terms and conditions undermine the library’s missions, and the activities
established to fulfill it, then the introduction of and transition to e-material will result in
reduced availability for library patrons.
Moreover, digital content and availability should be based on the economy of
abundance. Access to digital content offers huge potentiality to overcome physical
barriers and permits user to access to content at a time and in a place individually
chosen, without being restricted by opening hours. In this context, also, libraries remain
constraint by acquisition budgets. Each and every library cannot afford to acquire for
themselves all that is commercially available on the market. They rely on sharing
resources with other libraries in order to give good and adequate service to their
patrons.
Quoting OECD (2012), E-books: Developments and Policy Consideration,
http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k912zxg5svh-en, p. 8: “[…] While e-books can help increase
access to information, DRM represents a significant obstacle to lending of e-books,and
challenges the exercise of such rights by libraries which could be considered a public
interest concern in the foreseeable future. The service must not be proprietary, and be
available for different technological platforms and devices. The DRM generally
embedded in many e-books being produced today does not allow for the kind of free and
open access provided by, for example, public libraries. However, most e-editions in
scholarly libraries are free of DRM.[….] Because e-books are generally made available
for lending only to registered users at a particular library, libraries may need to
purchase multiple licences rather than sharing resources through interlibrary loans.
Costs may also be affected if territorial Digital Rights Management (DRM) restricts
libraries to purchasing geographically-specific editions of books […]”.

More generally, the question is whether it is necessary and desirable to negotiate
agreements to enable electronic lending, given that there is considerable uncertainty
about the legal status of e-lending under EU law. The EU Directive on Rental and
Lending does not explicitly exclude e-lending or lending of digital items from its scope
and some libraries argue that based on the current acquis and the UsedSoft decision by
the European Court of Justice they should be allowed to provide e-books in libraries for
download. In the Netherlands, the Association of Public Libraries (Vereniging van
Openbare Bibliotheken) has brought the matter before the courts. It has started a test
                                                                                             27
case against the CMO which collects the Dutch lending right fee, arguing that they
should be allowed to lend e-books under the current Rental Directive, while referring to
the UsedSoft decision. Its ultimate goal is to have the Dutch court ask questions on this
issue to the Court of Justice of the EU.

37.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
We would recommend to follow the EBLIDA principles on the acquisition and access to
e-books by libraries, highlighting among others the following needs:
●       All e-book titles and other intangible media, which have legally been made
available in whichever form, should be available to libraries for acquisition and access
and making available to the public;
●       All e-books titles should be available to libraries at the time of publication;
●       Publishers should deliver e-books in interoperable formats, or cooperate with
libraries in making interoperable formats;
●       Libraries should be permitted to make available acquired or licensed e-books for
a limited period of time to a user.
●       It should be possible to use the same e-book title simultaneously;
●       Authorised users should be able to download an e-book either in the library or by
way of remote access via authentication systems. (An authorised user is a user who has
registered with the library and whose identity is known to the library).

For these principles please see: www.eblida.org/Special%20Events/Key-principles-
acquistion-eBooks-November2012/GB_English%20Version%20Key%20Principles.pdf.

Public lending right (PLR) and e-lending
An adaptation of the PLR under the form of a legal licence (including a mandatory
exception whenever necessary) could be a path to follow to ensure a fair remuneration to
authors.


The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
There is no possible comparison between physical and online collection in libraries.
Currently, libraries can buy all physical publications, when they cannot buy licences to
all commercially available digital content because “the rights holders are free to decide
whether they want to give access to a specific work, and to decide on the terms for such
access. The consequence of this is that the collection building policy may be decided by
the publisher and not by the library “ (see EBLIDA, European Libraries and the
challenges of e-publishing, May 2012, at www.eblida.org/news/european-libraries-and-
the-challenges-of-e-publishing.html). In the long run this development threatens to
undermine the core function of libraries to preserve the knowledge and culture of our
societies and to keep it available to the public.
Libraries should have a “right to e-lend”, which will give the library users a “right to e-
read”.
                                                                                             28
The 'Study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in
the information society' that was commissioned by the European Commission and
published in December 2013 contains an interesting observation. At the end of the
section discussing inter alia the exception benefitting cultural heritage institutions, the
authors observe that:
"The large-scale digitization projects ultimately aim at the making available of the
collection, [...] the making available for consultation is increasingly requested to apply at
distance and online; and the lending is shifting to cover the online transmission of digital
items. The exception-by-exception reasoning, which is the model of the InfoSoc
Directive, might not be relevant anymore. Maybe it is time to look at different uses that
some categories of users (libraries or educational institutions) or some objectives (access
to culture and knowledge or education) would be privileged to undertake under a
limitation of copyright. [...] the space of non-infringing uses could be defined by their
objective and some general conditions, including a more open requirement that the use
does not exceed what is necessary for its objective. This is a radical move that this study
has not made. It could make our system of exceptions more fit for its purpose and
understandable for users and copyright owners alike. If the requirements for each
exception are adequate and legitimate, it would not sacrifice the high level of protection
of copyright and related rights that the EU law has adopted."

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
See our responses to Questions 32 to 41.

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other 36. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible

effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted) 37.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
From the perspective of cultural heritage institutions this question (and the following)
are too limited. The issue of mass digitization is far broader than what can be addressed
with the 2011 MoU and the 2012 Orphan Works Directive (the other relevant European
policy instrument in this area). Copyright issues related to the mass digitization of
collections and the subsequent making available of digitized works require a
comprehensive approach that cannot be based the principles of due diligence search and
licensing. If we want to enable European cultural heritage institutions to transfer their
collections into the digital age (and there cannot be any doubt that this is both an
important policy objective and a reasonable expectation of users who as taxpayers fund
these organisations) we need a far more comprehensive approach.
Both the 2012 Orphan Works Directive and the 2011 MoU on Out of Commerce Works
are insufficient to address the copyright issues arising from mass digitisation projects.
The Orphan Works Directive is ill-suited to enable mass digitisation projects. While it
will enable publicly accessible libraries, museums and archives to make orphan works
available after a due diligence search has been carried out for specific works, the
requirement of carrying out due diligence search makes it effectively unusable for mass
digitisation projects as this would require an huge additional investments in both time
and money.
The MoU on Out of Commerce Works could have offered solutions but, in addition to
the fact that national laws fail to fully address the needs of digital libraries, the MoU is
severely limited by its lack of implementation and concrete application across Europe,
so that e.g. cross-border effect is not legally enabled. It is most probable that the
question of cross-border access will be better solved by introducing an exception for
libraries, museums and archives to make available content resulting of mass digitisation
projects by an extension of Articles 5(2)c and 5(3)n of the InfoSoc Directive.
Alternatively, solutions such as Extended Collective Licensing exist that could well be
useful, as stated in the report available at:
www.ivir.nl/publicaties/guibault/ECL_Europeana_final_report092011.pdf. In the
Netherlands, cultural heritage institutions including libraries together with Dutch
CMOs have asked the government to investigate the possibility of introducing a Dutch
legal basis for Extended Collective Licensing
(www.fobid.nl/sites/fobid/files/130910ECL_briefZonderHandtek_def.pdf).


37
  France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                            30
41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
YES – Please explain
The mechanism should be based on an exception allowing for mass digitization of out-of-
commerce works. The mechanism should regulate right clearance in line with the
guidelines provided for in the Out of Commerce MoU guidelines. Moreover, The public
has a legitimate interest in having online access to the collections of all publicly
accessible libraries, museums and archives across Europe (see article 27.1 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights). There is no good reason for limiting
mechanisms that create such access to certain types of content. The approach proposed
in reaction to questions 40 and 34 above, would cover all types of works and other
subject matter that are held by these institutions. This solution would also be in line with
the relevant recommendation made in the 'New Renaissance' report of the Commission
appointed 'Comite de Sages' that was published in 2011. The report recommended that
'solutions for orphan works and out of distribution works must cover all the different
sectors: audiovisual, text, visual arts, sound'.



B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC 38 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
YES – Please explain
School and university libraries are resource centres for both students and teachers.
Collections are also built to provide teachers with wide spectre of pedagogical material
to be used and shared in the classroom and also more and more for distant learning.
However, not all member countries have implemented the exception 5(3)(a) for
illustration for teaching purposes, and those that have, usually have much more limited
exceptions than the article in the directive allows for . It is actually a quite open
exception. But since the implementation differs a lot between countries, what is
38
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                               31
permitted in one country is not allowed across the border. Universities, especially those
located next to a national border (such as Lille (France), Antwerpen (Belgium), or
having developed high-level specialisation and attractive student curricula usually need
teaching material to be as widely available as possible since they attract students from
all over Europe.
The development of Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs) challenges the way
exceptions for teaching have been implemented and request a shift towards a by default
exception for teaching.

43.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Most licences do not allow the extraction and reuse of reasonable portions of licensed
materials and their communication to Authorized Users through e-Learning platforms.
It is generally accepted that the exception provided by Art. 5(3)(a) of Directive
2001/29/EC covers both face-to-face and distance education, and that the fundamental
rights it protects (freedom of expression, right to be informed) are of crucial importance,
it is of particular importance the enforcement of this exception at European level,
prohibiting its restriction by national legislations, or by licences.
Licenses for electronic journals are usually very restrictive when it comes to serving
users outside of the institution, even electronic transmission of single articles in pdf-
format to external individual users or other libraries. It can however be printed and sent
by regular mail, which seems rather odd these days. University and college libraries
usually manage the licenses as a continuation of their earlier mission of providing
necessary literature and information for students and teachers.
As the Hargreaves report notes: Many university academics – along with teachers
elsewhere in the education sector – are uncertain what copyright permits for themselves
and their students. Administrators spend substantial sums of public money to entitle
academics and research students to access works which have often been produced at
public expense by academics and research students in the first place. (…) Senior figures
and institutions in the university sector have told the Review of the urgent need reform
copyright to realise opportunities, and to make it clear what researchers and educators
are allowed to do (Hargreaves 2011, p. 41). This highlights the need of legal certainty. A
broad exception for education mandatory (as all the other exceptions) would be first
part of the solution.
The rule stating that licenses override copyright must be changed and turned the other
way around, so that exceptions override the license terms if the licenses do not comply
with exceptions in copyright law.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
The legislation varies a great deal from country to country. The Nordic countries use the
ECL mechanism for copying (reproduction) of material for course packs, handouts and
the like. Some countries have an exception for performance of works in an educational
context, as long as it does not include any act of reproduction.

                                                                                        32
The mechanism of ECL is not supported by all member countries, and also it is
important not to introduce licenses where an exception should be in place. The article
5(3)(a) is quite open and could already allow for much broader exceptions than those
implemented in the different member states. Therefore a broad mandatory exception for
education that covers all kinds of works, in whatever format, is needed to support the
important purpose of teaching.


45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
[Open question]
The mandatory educational exception should cover all uses of all types of works for
illustration of teaching. It shall not be limited to any types of institution but rather
defined by its purpose: teaching.

46.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC 39 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
YES – Please explain
The exceptions are subject to such strict conditions which lead to scarce applications.
Even in case of an existing licence, larger literature studies or applying data ming to
text is hindered by additional requirement of permission from right holders, even if it
concerns temporary repository/ download of texts/data for research.

49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
Find below positions on Open Access and content mining as highlighted in Question 32:
- Open Access to research results: The Commission Recommendation of 17 July 2012 on
access to and preservation of scientific information, promotes the adoption by Member
States of policies that provide for the storage of the results of publicly funded research,
in online, open and free electronic infrastructures, which should be interoperable within
and outside the EU and suitable for long term preservation. Academic and research
libraries are directly involved in such activities: they are often responsible of their
parent institutional open access repositories. Other EU Recommendations require the
open access availability of articles and other publications which are the result of publicly
financed research, no later than six months after their publication. Some publishers
allow this practice to all their authors, others allow libraries to deposit just after long
negotiations, but the majority oppose clear refusal. There should be a legal instrument
enforcing – on one side - the right of authors in making their papers available to the
public for research and non-commercial purpose, and – on the other side - the right of
libraries or their parent institutions in collecting and making openly and publicly
available such content
- Content mining: The potential of text and data mining for scientific research is
enormous, and has been widely demonstrated. It is a process aimed to collect raw data
(e.g., the occurrence of words, figures etc. in a database), not creative expressions.
Libraries are interested in such utilization both for integrating content and metadata in
their catalogues and information systems, and for the benefit of their users. Undertaking
text and data mining of content to which researchers have already lawful access should
be considered a legitimate utilization, and should not be subject to re-license. But there
is not legal certainty on this point, and most standard licences do not allow content
mining. As a consequence, in most cases researchers give up research, rather than
addressing high transaction cost, both direct (cost of re-licensing) and indirect (the time
needed to negotiate). For this, an exception should explicitly legitimate text and data
mining on content on which researchers have lawful access, for research and non-
commercial purpose.




D.         Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC 40 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with


40
     Article 5 (3)b of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                         34
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 41.

The Marrakesh Treaty 42 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?
YES – Please explain by giving examples
(b) Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people
with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather
different implementations at Member States level. Within the ETIN initiative, facilitated
by the copyright of DG Market, and in good collaboration with FEP 43, IFRRO 44 and the
EWC 45, the consequences of these different national implementations of the so-called
disability exception are directly felt. For cross-border sharing of adapted materials
published under this exception the most progress can be made when we start sharing
within common languages. German is a common language for more than 3 countries, so
is French, and Dutch is shared between the Netherlands and Flanders. There are
specific copyright issues that are making the cross border sharing under ETIN
conditions difficult, and right holders are hesitant to sign the ETIN cross-border
licence/agreement for precisely these reasons. The most striking example of the
difference in the scope of what is lawfully defined as being print disabled can be found in
the German situation. Under German copyright law the disability exception is restricted
to those who cannot read print for sensory reasons, and this excludes circulation of these
copies among persons with dyslexia. In Austria this is not the case, meaning that a copy
made under the German disability exception could legally be distributed among a wider

group of beneficiaries in Austria than in Germany itself. Rights holders claim that this
cannot be done, because such use was never included when permission was granted to
produce the adapted copy. Also German Trusted Intermediaries (TI’s) cannot and will
not carry the responsibility for the use of the adapted copies they export to other TI’s in
different Member States, nor make a distinction how to distribute the adapted copies
they have imported. To quote Elke Dittmer, director of Medibus (the German
distributor of all adapted copies made in Germany):
“Within ETIN it means that all accessible books made in Germany are only for blind and
visually impaired users in other countries. Those libraries (abroad) who are serving also
other print disabled user can’t distribute our books to them. That means that they have to
classify the book which can be lend out to which category of disabled persons. And I have
no idea how to communicate this to a dyslexic person in Denmark that accessible books
from Netherlands are for him but not the German ones. If we would join ETIN our
colleagues in other countries will face problems with different groups of disabled people
and maybe this is also a legal problem because it could be a discrimination to some
people.” 46
Between the Netherlands and Flanders there are also barriers that need to be solved
before a full sharing of the collections made in the Netherlands and those in Flanders
can start to flow optimally. The differences here are not on the level of the copyright
exception in the copyright laws, but in the voluntary arrangements that the Dutch TI
and the Flanders TI have with their respective publishers organizations, for instance
whether online distribution of adapted copies can be done or how the lending of these
copies through public libraries is remunerated per lending. So not only differences in
national copyright laws, but all differences in implementing and servicing the
beneficiaries in the various Member States need to be overcome.
On a national level
On the whole one could say that the Dutch copyright law and its “handicap-exception”
provides a good basis for facilitating and implementing a service to the print disabled in
the Netherlands. For decades workable solutions have been found in voluntary collective
agreements with the rights holders and services have been implemented through a
special budget for Adapted reading that is under the control of the Dutch SIOB 47. Of
course that budget is not enough. It allows not even for less than 10% of all that is
published in the Netherlands. No wonder we like to be able to import more text books,
especially from the US and the UK to supply to print disabled students at high schools
and universities. Many of these schools teach courses in English and the adapted version
are available in mainly in the US, but are not allowed to leave the country. TIGAR is the
beginning of a solution, but is (much too) slow and title by title clearance is necessary. In
many cases the more recent books cannot be cleared. ETIN is no solution for the US
books for obvious reasons. The WIPO Marrakesh Treaty gives a hopeful perspective,
but it could take years before important exporting countries like the US and UK will
ratify it.
The handicap exception clause in the Dutch copyright law is like many other limitations
subject to the three-step-test of the Bern Convention. Meaning that a right holder may
resist the making of a adapted copy if there is an accessible copy on the commercial
market. At the moment that is very seldom the case. With the emergence of eBooks that

might change rapidly. Can the right holders resist making an accessible version under
the handicap exception when they have published an eBook that could in theory and
with a lot of technical dexterity be read through synthetic speech output? That will
indeed be big setback for the beneficiaries of accessible copies, because the eBook and its
ecosystem of ordering, downloading and reading is not nearly as accessible as the Daisy
Audio book services that the TI’s provide.

(a) A primary fundamental problem regarding inclusion is that a person with a
disability can only borrow, not buy adapted materials.
An example of European cross-border obstacles: A Flemish person with a disability
wishing to read a Spanish book, addressing him/herself to the library for people with a
handicap in Spain, called ONCE, cannot get this book, neither by becoming member of
this Spanish library, nor by ordering it through the Flemish Adapted Reading Library
Luisterpunt. The situation is the same in case one is interested in reading English or
German titles.


51.    If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]
For all target groups of people with a disability in Europe it is of utmost importance that
the International WIPO Treaty (Marrakesh 2013) is rapidly signed and ratified both by
the European Union, as well as by all individual Member States. The effect will be that
the adaption in a readable format becomes a right; that distribution of books in adapted
reading formats to all types of user groups becomes possible; that cross-border lending
goes without problems; that both online distribution and distribution on a carrier
(Daisy-cd, Braille-print) are service-possibilities. Close cooperation with the adapted
reading user-organisations involved like in the Netherlands, the library sector with the
Oogvereniging, can make clear why swift EU-wide ratification of the WIPO Treaty is
necessary.
On cross border sharing: we need a unified/harmonized definition on what is meant to
be print disabled, based on the human rights as explained in the UN Convention on the
rights of persons. The Marrakesh Treaty points the way forward, but implementation
may take a too long time. We need intermediary solutions that can create a better flow
of adapted accessible copies across borders. The difference between ETIN and TIGAR
should be overcome – through an extension of the ETIN MoU? and both should work
along the same legal frameworks.
On definition of print disabled: we cannot discriminate between types of handicap.
On the definition of accessibility: we need to make the definition of accessibility against
the benchmark of normal reading: that means: an accessible version can be searched
for, found and read in a way that is equitable to what sighted people can. This is
sometimes referred to as the ecosystem of reading. The availability of a simple
(unstructured audio, not synchronized), is not enough to justify the label “accessible” .
Sighted people can flip through their book, browse website, order books, use eReaders,
search in eBooks etc. All these functions should become or stay available to the print
disabled readers too.




                                                                                        37
52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
[Open question]
As explained in Question 50: In the Netherlands good cooperation exists between the
producers of accessible copies (Dedicon) and the publishers through their national
association NUV. NUV recommends the cooperation between publishers and Dedicon
and in many cases this leads to efficient production. However, re-selling the adapted
copy back to original owner/publisher hardly ever happens. In the future this might be a
workable model however. That all depends if and to what extent the file formats for
eBooks and those for accessible versions such as Daisy will be truly integrated and
embraced by the marketplace. For the time being the two are not integrated. Dedicon
could however upgrade/convert the publisher’s digital file, not only to make the needed
Braille version, but to enrich the eBook with certain navigation markers, or media
overlays to make it more attractive for the publisher to put on the market. The
collaboration between the Daisy Consortium and the International Digital Publishing
Forum (IDPF) on the ePub3 standard is an excellent facilitator for that.
At the European level: It has become clear that a more equitable situation all over
Europe is necessary. Standards are necessary to develop sustainable solutions for
adapted reading formats. ETIN exists already two years but didn’t realise concrete
results for the target groups. The ETIN-project for cross-border lending of accessible
materials for print disabled persons is important, but can only be successful if the EU
supports it by project money and give support to a first step in the project in which
cross-border lending between countries with the same language becomes possible.


E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics 48 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not

     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe” 49. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
YES – Please explain
The potential of text and data mining for scientific research is enormous, and has been
widely demonstrated (see JISC (2012), The value and benefits of text mining, at
www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/publications/reports/2012/value-text-mining.pdf), see
also key resources below. It is a process aimed to collect raw data (e.g. the occurrence of
words, figures etc. in a database), not creative expressions. Undertaking text and data
mining of content to which researchers have already lawful access should be considered
a legitimate utilization, and should not be subject to re-license. But there is not legal
certainty on this point, and most standard licences do not allow content mining. As a
consequence, in most cases researchers give up research, rather than addressing high
transaction cost, both direct (cost of re-licensing) and indirect (the time needed to
negotiate). For this, an exception should explicitly legitimate text and data mining on
content on which researchers have lawful access.
Since in most cases it is necessary to make a copy of the content in order for a machine
to extract facts and data for mining, the act of text and data mining is precluded under
copyright law in Europe. Because it prevents the copying of large portions of databases,
the Database Directive is also a legal barrier to text and data mining. Technical
protection measures (also protected under law), preventing the downloading of large
amounts of content, are also preventing the application of text and data mining
techniques. Although text and data mining is concerned with the extraction of facts and
data, the results of text and data mining research are currently being suppressed
because of a lack of legal clarity.

Even if content is openly available on the Web, without explicit permission indicating
otherwise, it is unclear if the copying of this content for the purpose of text and data
mining is legal. Content licensed under Open Access licences such as CC-BY-SA or CC-
BY-NC may be inadvertently preventing users from mining the content.

•      Text and data mining is concerned with the extraction of facts and data, which
are not covered by copyright

•      Text and data mining may infringe copyright because it is necessary to make
copies of content to convert it into machine readable format

54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Researchers must have lawful access and be able to share the results of text and data
mining, as long as these results are not substitutable for the original copyright work -
irrespective of copyright law, database law or contractual terms to the contrary. A
specific exception to this effect allowing the copying of content for the purpose of text
and data mining is necessary. Such an exception should not distinguish between
commercial and non-commercial purposes as, for research institutions, this would
prevent knowledge transfer.
•      An exception for text and data mining would provide legal certainty;

•      TPMs and contracts should not override such an exception;

•      Differentiating between commercial and non-commercial activity is not in the
public interest.


55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?


                                                                                      40
[Open question]
A legislative solution should take the form of an exception which allows the copying of
content and the circumvention of TPMs for text and data mining purposes. This
exception must not be over-ridable by contracts.

56.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Licensing will not work as an alternative solution. The negotiation of licences is resource
intensive and unscalable, nor will licences address the current ambiguity around the
mining of the open Web.

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
[Open question]
For data in databases not owned by libraries or universities a license agreement is
needed. In that situation, TDM becomes a property right and a security issue.


F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs 50. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders

50
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           41
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions 51.

61.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
From the perspective of cultural heritage institutions, it would be desirable if users
would not only be allowed to make private copies of material that cultural heritage
institutions offer but also had the right to share protected works for non-commercial
purposes. From our perspective it is beneficial if cultural heritage content cannot only
be accessed but also become part of conversations between citizens. Furthermore,
libraries aim to stimulate creativity and to facilitate co-creation by citizens, as partners
in the cultural and creative sector, supporting a creative Europe. A sector wide
approach with pilots for creative citizens maker spaces etc. will give a better sense of the
problems for all stakeholders involved.


62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
From the perspective of libraries and cultural heritage institutions, an additional
exception that allows non-commercial sharing of protected works by individuals would
provide sufficient room for online engagement with works made available by cultural
heritage institutions (note that this should not be limited to works that are made
available by cultural heritage institutions but apply to all protected works).

 III.     Private copying and reprography


                                                                                         43
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying 52. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees 5354.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of

YES – Please explain
It is necessary for transparency and the user’s right to be informed. Diverging national
systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in obstacles to
the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time, many
Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person, public entity, or business). In that context, not all Member
States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could
remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments.

 IV.           Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers 59 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 60. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic

benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

     V.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE 61 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text 62. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
61
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.

   You will find more information on the following website:

copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose 63. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure 64. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
Limitation of ISPs liability is important, otherwise there is a risk of reducing freedom of
expression and freedom of communication.
The general term “intermediary” is not very precise and can create uncertainty as to
who is an intermediary. Libraries shall not be considered intermediaries in this context,
or any legislation should seek to make clear when libraries and educational
establishments are in or out of scope. We certainly believe that if any obligations are put
on intermediaries as has been the case with Three Strikes Legislation, that
libraries/educational establishments should be given a safe harbour in law.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
 YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain

63
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.

   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

    VI. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
YES


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
In line with our previous answers any tool that would provide more coherence into the
EU copyright system would be very welcome. A single EU copyright title could achieve a
fully functioning single digital market and enable cross-border effect. See the Wittem
Group’s      European       Copyright     Code,     April    2010,      available    at

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
Copyright law reform at the European level is absolutely necessary to simplify the
current complicated regime and the overlapping of different directives. Licensing
initiatives alone will not achieve this. Meanwhile, the EU should develop mechanisms to
ensure that licence clauses cannot override exceptions and limitations. During the
previous Licences for Europe dialogue, it has never been made possible to discuss this
issue, hence the need of urgent decision on that point. For the same reason, the removal
of technological protection measures should be made compulsory for all legitimate uses.

Licenses for libraries
The exclusive rights that exist in regards to published works should not include the right
of refusal to sell to libraries, or to limit their services, both in physical and digital
environment. Commercial licences for libraries should include and not override the
utilizations presently permitted by the InfoSoc and Database Directives. In all cases, the
use of the acquired materials should be allowed for the following purposes:
a.      Research. The Library, its parent Institution’s staff and affiliates together with
its Authorized Users should, from a place and at a time individually chosen by them, be
able to search, retrieve, and display the licensed materials, print or download and save
individual chapters, articles or items of the licensed materials without legal or
technological impediment. Moreover, they should be able to use data and text mining
technologies to derive information from the licensed materials for computational
analysis and other research purposes.
b.      Education and Teaching. The Library and its Authorized Users should be able to
extract or use information contained in licensed materials for educational, scientific, or
research purposes, including extraction and manipulation of information or images for
the purpose of illustration, explanation, comment, criticism, teaching, research, or
analysis. The Library and/or its parent Institution’s staff and affiliates should be able to
use a reasonable portion of licensed materials in the course of instruction and
communicate same material to Authorized Users at a place and time convenient to them.
c.      Scholarly Sharing. Authorized Users should be able to transmit to a third party
colleague in hard copy or electronically, insubstantial amounts of the licensed materials
for personal, scholarly, educational, scientific, or research uses. Authorized Users should
be able to use, with appropriate credit, figures, tables and brief excerpts from the
Licensed Materials in the Authorized User’s own scientific, scholarly and educational
works. When an Authorized User is the Author of an article which is part of the licensed
materials, and which is the result of a publicly funded research, he/she or the Library
staff should be able to put such work, with appropriate credit to the Publisher, in an
Open Access repository after a reasonable time from the date of its publication.
d.      Interlibrary Loan. Licensee’s staff should be able to provide to other libraries or
cultural institutions whether by post or fax, or secure electronic transmission, whereby
the electronic file is deleted immediately after printing, for the purposes of research or
private study and not for Commercial Use, a single copy of articles, chapters, or other
individual documents from licensed materials.
e.      Technical Accessibility, usability and interoperability. Format shifting and other
adaptations should be permitted for long-term preservation purposes, or to ensure
technical accessibility and usability by visually impaired Authorized users, or to
effectively integrate Licensed Materials in Library information systems, according to
international standards of interoperability. Within the limits of these purposes, the
Licensor should agree to temporarily remove the technical barriers that may prevent
adaptations.
f.      Administrative and Judicial Proceedings. The Library, its parent Institution’s
staff, affiliates and authorized users should be able to transmit and/or upload individual
articles to secure electronic systems for judicial and administrative use, including any
national research quality assessment (such as RAE in UK or VQR in Italy) and the
selection procedures for academic and professional careers.
g.      Archival Availability. The Library should be granted a nonexclusive, royalty-
free, perpetual right to use any licensed materials accessed during the License term. The
Licensor should permit the Library to archive one complete copy of the Licensed
Materials, and permit use of the archived materials in the event that access is

                                                                                         50
discontinued or suspended. Such use should be in accordance with the provisions of the
agreement, which provisions shall survive any termination of it, provided that the
contractual terms of the License agreement will not override any statutory provisions
regarding the entry of the work into the public domain. This means that the archival
copy should be free after the termination of copyright terms, when it enters in the public
domain. It should be prevented the revival of exclusive "sui generis" rights.. Once a
work is out-of-commerce in its all versions, Libraries should be entitled to give
unrestricted access to licensed materials.

We would like to quote some excerpts of the report of P.B. Hugenholtz & M.R.F.
Senftleben (2011, November). Fair Use in Europe. In Search of Flexibilities. IViR.
Amsterdam,                      Netherlands.                  Available                     at,

       Page 10: “The current lack of flexibility in copyright law undermines the very
fundamental freedoms, societal interests and economic goals that copyright law
traditionally aims to protect and advance. This is the case particularly in the area of
limitations and exceptions – an area where more than elsewhere in the law of copyright
rules have become detailed, rigid and connected to specific states of technology.
Examples abound. Whereas social media have in recent times become an essential
means of social and cultural communication, current copyright law leaves little or no
room for sharing ‘user-generated content’ that builds upon pre-existing works. By the
same token, current limitations and exceptions rarely take into consideration current
educational and scholarly practices, such as the use of copyright protected content in
Powerpoint presentations, in ‘digital classrooms’, on university websites or in scholarly
e-mail correspondence. Existing limitations and exceptions in many Member States’
copyright laws also find it hard to accommodate such essential information tools as
search engines. By impeding these and other uses that should arguably remain outside
the reach of copyright protection, the law’s overly rigorous structure impedes not only
cultural, social and economic progress, but also undermines the social legitimacy of
copyright law proper.”
       Page 17: “The EU acquis, in other words, contains flexibilities that may be
invisible at the national level because of an overly cautious and restrictive
implementation.”
       Page 29: “There appear to be good reasons and ample opportunity to
(re)introduce a measure of flexibility in the national copyright systems of Europe. The
need for having more openness in copyright law is almost self-evident in this
‘information society’ of highly dynamic and unpredictable change. A historic
perspective also suggests that, due to a variety of circumstances, copyright law,
particularly in the civil law jurisdictions of Europe, has lost much of its flexibility in the
course of the past century. In other words, making copyright law in author’s rights
regimes more flexible would not go against the grain of legal tradition. (…) We would
therefore recommend to introduce a measure of flexibility alongside the existing
structure of well-defined limitations and exceptions, and thus combine the
advantages of legal security and technological neutrality.”

To conclude, we would like to ensure that any copyright review will not lead to EU
legislation which is less progressive than the current regime. A comparative study of the
current 28 copyright regimes identifying the most up-to-date and progressive solutions
developed in Member States could be a good work in parallel to this consultation.
