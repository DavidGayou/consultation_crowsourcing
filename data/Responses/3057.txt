Object: Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules


Dear Sir or Madam,

As a French citizen, I would like to answer your public consultation about the evolution of the European
Union’s copyright policies. I will do so by proposing some concrete changes which I think should be
made to those policies.

1   Copyright term reduction

I understand copyright as a balance struck between society’s desire to use, distribute, adapt upon and
perform creative works, and the necessity to incentivize creators by granting them a temporary monopoly
over some rights on their work.
Current European legislation protects the rights of authors until seventy years after their death. This is
disproportionate: such a long duration is certainly not required to encourage or sustain any reasonable
form of creation, whereas society is substantially missing out on the opportunity to benefit from many
works of art over this long period.
The only explanation I can see to the current state of affairs is that it was achieved through organized
lobbying by right holders, which faced little resistance: because the general public does not know about
the public domain or realize its importance, and because the organizations which attempt to protect it
have a comparatively small economic weight.
I would therefore be in favor of restricting the duration of copyright in European member states, in all
circumstances, to no more than 25 years after publication, performance or broadcast.

2   Protection of orphan works

Since the Berne convention, there are no formalities required to assert copyright over your work; so
that, for works with no known or reachable right holder, one must assume by default that the work is
protected. Hence, the public’s use of the work is limited to protect the monopoly of an absentee right
holder: one cannot republish, digitize, adapt upon the work, for fear that the right holder may later
resurface and sue for damages.
I am not in favor of introducing mandatory registration formalities for copyright, as I fear they would
penalize the less-organized forms of creation (street art, amateur artists, etc.) who would probably not
follow them.
However, I believe that, once the creator of a work has ceased to distribute it (out of print books,
unmaintained software, etc.), and it has been impossible to contact them for some period of time,
copyright protections on the work should lapse. The rationale would be analogous to that of acquisitive
prescription: the right holder has shown insufficient motivation to exercise their exclusive rights.

3   No protection for public organisms

If a work has been created by employees of European Union member states or European institutions
during the course of their duties, it should not enjoy any copyright protection. The reason for this is
that there is no need to incentivize or finance such creation, and as this is the best regime to allow the
public to benefit from such works created using public money.
This would have many positive effects. As a first example, this would encourage the dissemination of
publicly financed research, and ensure that copyright cannot be leveraged by academic publishers to
restrict the transmission of scientific knowledge to the general public who indirectly paid for it. Hence,
this would contribute to the decline of closed-access scientific venues, which would help decrease the
proportion of public research money spent on subscription fees.
As a second example, this would ensure that open data efforts from public organisms must remain really
open. This would not not prohibit the sale of extended datasets so that the cost of publishing open data
is covered by those who make use of it, but it would ensure that copyright cannot be used as a weapon
to limit the further redistribution of such datasets, as could be attempted by short-sighted organisms in
a foolish attempt to reap easy profits at the public’s ultimate expense.

4   Digital rights management

Digital rights management (DRM) are a set of technologies to limit the copying of digital content in
an effort to enforce copyright. Works burdened with DRM usually require specific software, operating
system, hardware (sometimes from a specific manufacturer), in order to be consumed. Further, some
such technologies require the user to remain in contact with the right holder’s server to authorize every
use of content, so that the works become unusable once technical intermediaries discontinue the service
or remain out of business.
DRM is present on a variety of digital contents, such as e-books (Amazon), video games (Steam), movies
(most DVDs), etc. While I respect the right of manufacturers and right holders to offer such content
under such conditions, it seems paramount to me that customers be aware of the nature of what they
are buying. Right now, the public is not well-informed about the nature and existence of DRM, and the
presence of DRM is seldom clearly advertised.
I would argue that any creative work on sale should indicate prominently to the purchaser which equip-
ment is required to read it: software, hardware from a specific manufacturer, and more generally any
technology that it is an open standard which can be re-implemented by anyone (i.e., not requiring the
payment of any royalties).
Further, if a creative work is offered in a scrambled form designed to be unusable without additional keys
provided every time the content is consumed, it should be mandatory to label such offers as ”rental”
rather than ”sale”, as continued enjoyment of the work by the customer depends on the provider’s will
to further allow it.
Current European directives, such as Directive 2001/29/EC, have overreaching provisions which prohibit
circumventing DRM, providing technical means to enable it, etc. This often prohibits legitimate cases
of DRM circumvention, such as those required for interoperability. Prohibiting copyright infringement
is sufficient ; no additional protection should be granted to DRM technologies.

5   Freedom of panorama

The ”freedom of panorama” exemption restricts the copyright protection of works of art permanently
located in a public place. This exemption exists in some member countries but not others. European
legislation should be harmonized by providing freedom of panorama in all member states, in its strongest
form: there should not be any copyright protection of works of art permanently located in public space,
as such copyright protection substantially interferes with the public’s right to photograph and film in
public space.

6   Remixing

A huge amount of creativity nowadays is expressed by producing works of art that current copyright
legislation consider to be derivative: remixes of well-known songs, fan fictions, videos incorporating
sequences of protected video games, etc. The legal status of such works is entirely unclear, and right
holders can leverage this to discourage, or censor, such creative works.
In my opinion, the need to incentivize creation through copyright does not justify such restrictions on
derivative art forms. Indeed, such transformation has always been an important factor of creativity
(folk tales, reuse of musical themes, etc.). It is regrettable that copyright has crept from restrictions
on ”fixed-form works” to restrictions on certain derivative uses such as performance and translation, to
eventually impose overbearing theoretical restrictions on any form of derivative use, which I believe does
not reflect the interest of society.
I believe the scope of copyright protection should be changed so that it does not impede transformative
uses that cannot harm the interests of the creator. For instance, fan fictions certainly cannot be read as
a substitute to the original book, nor can most remixes replace the original song, nor playthrough videos
act as a substitute to a video game.

7   Private sharing

Not-for-profit sharing of copyrighted works between private individuals is a widespread practice in Eu-
ropean member states. It was essentially uncontroversial in the times where works of art were fixed to a
physical medium (such as books, CDs, etc.), because this made copying unpractical so that sharing was
essentially limited to lending.
For digital works, such practices raise the question of how creators should be financed. However, prohibit-
ing it altogether, as is currently done, does not seem sensible: it is disconnected from current practice
and from the public’s perception of right and wrong. I am unsure about whether a middle ground could
be found with solutions such as the French ”licence globale” proposals which propose to finance artistic
creation through taxation and redistribution to creators: indeed, I do not see how to design a scheme of
this kind while ensuring that it finances all artists fairly, including independent artists not registered to
any copyright collection society.
I am nevertheless confident that new ways to finance creation, such as crowdfunding, will emerge; that
the public is aware of the fact that they need to pay the creators of works they enjoy, and that private
artistic sponsorship will increase as technologies reduces the friction of online payment. Hence, I would be
in favor of a copyright exemption covering the not-for-profit exchange of creative works between private
individuals, as a solution preferable to the current state of affairs.

8   Fair agreements between copyright collective and their members

Copyright is usually held, not by artists, but by copyright collectives of which they are members. Some
of these, such as the French SACEM, require that their members automatically assign copyright to them
on all their future creative works; terminating one’s contract with SACEM is a lengthy and complicated
process.
Such agreements are nothing short of creative servitude; the signer agrees to the transfer of all the
fruits of their creativity, with little limits, uncertain compensation, for an indeterminate amount of time.
Contracts of this kind should be deemed unfair and considered null and void.
Transferring preemptively one’s copyright on one’s future creations should be impossible except within
employment contracts, in which case this arrangement should be restricted to the hours worked by the
employee; additionally, resignation should always be possible, and all relevant labour protection laws
should apply.
