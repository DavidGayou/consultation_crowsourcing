    Re: Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules

    Ericsson welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the Commission’s consultation and is
    pleased to be able to participate in this very important discussion regarding modernization of
    copyright in the context of growth, creativity, innovation and values.

    Some key Ericsson facts:

       Ericsson is the world's largest mobile telecom infrastructure and services company with net
        sales revenue in 2012 amounting to SEK 227.8 billion (USD 33.8 billion). Today, more than
        40 percent of the world’s mobile traffic passes through networks provided by Ericsson.

       Ericsson is world market leader in Multi-screen TV solutions, IPTV solutions and media
        compression technologies. More than 40% of world wide pay-TV subscribers recieve on-
        demand content enabled by Ericsson solutions. Ericsson is the pioneer of LTE-Broadcasting
        technologies.

       Ericsson is the world's number one mobile network, real-time charging and billing, and
        telecom services provider. More than 1.4 billion consumers are charged and billed through
        Ericsson’s solutions.

       Ericsson reached a milestone in May 2013, providing managed services to networks that
        serve more than 1 billion subscribers and Ericsson has signed more than 300 contracts
        worldwide.

       As the world’s leading technology provider, Ericsson plays a key role in the development of
        standards in fixed and mobile voice, data (IP) and TV/video technologies, and hence is a key
        actor in the digital economy by enabling and empowering innovation with technological
        means and solutions.

       Ericsson employs over 110,000 staff worldwide and over 20% or 24,000 of those are
        dedicated to R&D. Ericsson invested SEK 32.8 billion (USD 4.9 billion) in R&D in 2012 of
        which predominant share was invested in EU based research facilities.

    1 ENABLING SUSTAINED SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROGRESS
    Increased adoption of ICT and broadband enhances productivity in virtualy all sectors of
    the economy and hence is a key input source for economic growth, job creation, and
    new business creation across all sectors of the economy. Furthermore, understanding
    the transformative impact of general purpose technologies such as ICT and
    broadband (BB) on the overal economy and society is crucial.1 This sort of economic
    impact is more significant than for example the impact on economy from increased
    expenditure of consumer goods. This is because increased use of and expenditure on
    ICT can transform economies by putting them on to new and long lasting growth
    creating trajectories. In other words the impact of ICT must primarily be understod from
    its consequence on all other sectors of the economy and not on the ICT industry as such.
    Some important economic effects caused by ICT and broadband that have been
    identified are2:

                 Building knowledge society by improving human capital. Increased ICT intensity
                  creates demand for higher skilled labor.
                 Driver of multifactor productivity growth, which includes the impact of intangible
                  investments and innovation such as organizational changes, new distribution and
                  production processes, and new methods of doing business due to the increased
                  adoption of ICT technology.
                 For every 10 percentage point increase in broadband penetration the isolated
                  economic effect on GDP growth is around 1% of GDP, with estimates varying
                  between 0.5% - 2%.
                 For every 1,000 additional broadband users, around 80 jobs are created, with
                  estimates varying between 20 and 130.
                 Doubling the average attained broadband speed for an economy increases GDP
                  by 0.3% points.
                 +1% point increase in BB penetration > 3,5% increase in new business
                  registration


    1.1 CONTENT AVAILABILITY A VITAL LINK TO REALIZE IMPACT

    A vital link exists between the economic impact of ICT and broadband described above
    and the availability of digital content such as audiovisual and other creative works (see
    figure 1). Availability of digital content and services is an initial trigger that motivates the

    mass adoption3 of ubiquitous high-speed broadband services. Supply side broadband
    policies that promote availability of high-speed broadband rollout are of course
    necessary but unfortunately insufficient since mass adoption of broadband is also
    interdependent upon additional factors, see figure1.

    Consequently, sound demand-side broadband drivers such as the availability of on-
    demand digital creative works (see figure 2) need to be in place to stimulate the up-take
    of high-speed broadband services and consequently realize the economic impact. These
    demand side drivers include:

                 Increasing economies of scope by increasing the availability of digital on-demand
                  content and services; hereby expanding the scope of trade in digital goods and
                  services including digital creative works,
                 Increasing the scale of economies by creating a single digital market; i.e.
                  maximizing the geographic size of a EU borderless digital market,
                 Lowering transaction costs and distortions in the market, such as due to market
                  fragmentation, market conduct (windowing, hold-back etc.) and outdated
                  regulatory regimes (rights clearing, clearing exchange mechanisms, film state aid
                  rules, differentiated VAT4-rates etc.)

             Stimulating consumer demand by increasing the level of mass-personalization of
              content services according to individual preferences (choice, time, device and
              place of consumption) and purchasing power.


    FIGURE 2: DIGITAL CONTENT A KEY DRIVER OF HIGH SPEED BROADBAND




                                        SOURCE: COPENHAGEN ECONOMICS STOCKHOLM JANUARY 2012



    The creative industry is normally understood as comprising of individuals and
    organizations that create and distribute content designed to inform, educate and
    entertain particular audiences. The fact that the sector’s prime activity is content
    generation means that issues concerned with content, its creation and its effects on
    audiences and society, tend to dominate industry discourse.

    However, recognizing that creative works are both economic and cultural goods, the
    economic dimension is much more versatile than traditionally considered, i.e. not only
    limited to the creative sectors. As explained above the socio-economic impact from ICT
    and broadband is dependent upon adoption of high-speed broadband services, which
    subsequently is dependent upon the availability of digital content and services triggering
    adoption. This interdependency is crucial to emphasize in progressive economic
    policy making as its transcending consequences reach far beyond Creative and
    ICT industries immediate and narrower priorities. Or more shortly, as expressed in a
    World Economic Forum Publication Jan. 2014 “Norms and Values in Digital Media:
    Rethinking Intellectual Property in the Digital Age” page 6:

    “Expand access to content: Offer a wide range of means for the public to reach content,
    enabled by the Internet and other technologies, maximizing societal and economic
    benefit.”

                                                                                  Public Document
    It is essential to also recognize that increasing access to content, such as European
    feature film is in the interest of European film industry as pointed out recently by
    European Commission:

    “… suggests that the European film industry can increase revenues by exploiting
    different types of profit-making online platforms to increase the availability of films and
    reach new audiences..”

    Furthermore, that online/on-demand platforms can help to bridge the urban-rural cultural
    divide in the EU:

    “14% of respondents have no access to cinemas within 30 minutes of their home. This
    figure rises to 37% in Romania, 27% in Lithuania and 16% in Croatia”

    1.2 THE TRANSFORMATIONAL (IN)CAPACITY OF COPYRIGHT

    Given the significant role of digital content and services triggering and driving mass-
    adoption of high speed broadband services and consequently enabling the realization
    of socio-economic benefits, the degree of digital transition of creative industries
    becomes a critical measure to assess the creative industries participation and
    contribution to drive mass-adoption and ultimately realization of socio-economic
    benefits.

    An evidence-based approach to measure the degree of digital transition in creative
    industries is to relate the share of digital revenues to total (digital and non-digital)
    revenues, hereby avoiding the pitfalls of blunt measures such as a mere count 5 of digital
    services. Regrettably as shown in figure 3, one can only conclude that digital creative
    transition in the EU is quite under-developed and a creative digital market is still in its
    infancy not to mention the absence of a European Digital Single Market. Thus it seems
    more than reasonable to apprehend that the current underdeveloped state of
    creative digital transition in the EU must be considered as one of the primary
    public policy objectives that need to be addressed in the current copyright
    consultation.




    5
      Mere count of digital services does not recognize important factors to assess the level of success of a digital services such as;
    timely availability, the range and depth of titles available, business models (subscription, download to own, advertising), ability to
    time/format/device shift content, payment methods (credit card, pre-paid), easy of use and affordable price points. Please note a
    revenue based approach is less appropriate for Public TV service provider but rather a comparison of digital programming to total
    programming would be more appropriate alternative.

    2. ERICSSON’S RESPONSE TO SELECTED QUESTIONS

    Q 1[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
    trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in
    which you live?

    High price and lack of availability of content is the key domestic/national market barrier
    today in Europe for watching on-demand/online content. Naturally, from this follows that
    access to on-demand/online content across territories becomes even more cumbersome
    and restrictive due to territorial copyright restrictions, licensing conduct, geo-blocking,
    price discrimination hold-back and windowing.

    FIGURE 4 NATIONAL TOP 5 BARRIERS TO WATCH ON-DEMAND CONTENT


                                 National Top 5 barriers to watch on-demand TV/Video Content

                  on main TV screen

       Poor selection of on-demand TV/video available;

                 The price for on-demand TV/Video is too
                             expensive for me

    Consumers’ understanding of access to TV/Video content is changing as time spent in
    front of main screen is stabilizing/declining (see page 6 Consumerlab TV/Media Study
    2013) while at the same time spent consuming content using a smartphone, tablet
    and/or laptop continue to grow both in terms of adoption and average time spent. Since
    these new devices offer mobility and/or nomadic access to content outside home,
    content that is available on the first screen but not on the second and third screen will
    become evident for these consumers. This means that consumers conceptualization of
    already relatively poor on-demand content availability (figure 4) on the first screen will
    further decline on second and third screen while these very same consumers are away
    from home and particularly when crossing national borders. In 2011, more than 1 billion

    holiday trips were made by EU residents (EU-27) of which ~1/4 or 240 million visits
    where made in another member state. In addition in 2011 about 140 million work related
    trips where made by EU residents (EU-27).6 These big numbers tell us at least one
    story, as opportunity to access “home”/ 1st Screen-TV content via mobile and/or nomadic
    devices grows, it is very likely to assume that EU consumers’ while attempting to access
    to their “home-content” outside their home territories not only becomes an evident
    benchmark of the absent Creative Digital Single Market but also frequently experienced
    situation in the whole EU internal market.

    Or more shortly, we have now come to the point when leading insiders of the creative
    industry, like Kevin Spacey, are also calling for increased availability of content:

    Audience wants the freedom.. they want control….“give consumers what they want,
    when they want it and in the format they want it and at reasonable price..”



    Q7 Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
    market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border
    availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate
    level of protection for right holders?

    Before going into the need for further measures, a comment on justification for additional
    measures is required. Ericsson offers four distinct reasons that justify further
    interventions:

                 Any improvement of cross-border availability of content services must start with
                  the assessment of national content availability and in particular the
                  availability of digital on-demand/on-line content since this is a prerequisite for
                  effective cross border content dissemination and also is an existing policy
                  imperative for the Digital Single Market. In other words, EU-wide synchronized
                  DVD release schedule is neither relevant nor sufficient ambition of EU Digital
                  Agenda and the EU DSM.
                 From a territorial/member state perspective, increased availability of digital on
                  demand/online content is also relevant to narrow down the national cultural
                  gap in terms of access to physical content in urban vs. rural areas, since access
                  to cultural outlets, such as cinema, theater and opera is significantly more limited
                  in rural areas. Not only will increased digital creative content availability of on-
                  demand/on-line distribution increase the opportunities for rural European regions
                  to enjoy culture and hereby foster cultural inclusion but furthermore it will
                  increase the opportunity to spread cultural diversity across the EU frontier.

                  From a consumer point of view, accessing culture and entertainment via physical
                   and/or appointment based methods comes with following short comings:

                        the physical availability is restricted to certain locations, to certain days,
                         certain times of the day and the amount of available seats, which limits
                         consumption opportunities,
                        physical screen limitations (number of screens per theatre/city) restrict the
                         range of titles available at any given time, which excludes non-block-buster
                         types of films, such as independent creations, regional and local productions
                         which limits cultural diversity.

                  Given the socio-economic effects described in section one, Ericsson argues that
                   it is in the public interest and hence policy maker’s interest to balance the
                   self-interest of Creative sectors with the aim to: promote open and
                   competitive markets in licensed and exempt digital on-demand/on-line
                   content, with the aim to increase availability of more legitimate pan-European
                   digital content services, in ways and at prices which appeals to consumers and to
                   decrease digital cultural exclusion caused by licensing conduct and to make
                   exceptions more flexible and harmonized, with the aim to promote innovation and
                   growth of the DSM.

     What should the interventions aim to achieve?

     There is no doubt about the importance of copyright regime and the incentives it creates
     for certain market behavior and hence licensing conduct. And in the case of the EU
     Internal Market it is unfortunately still too much about non-digital incentives as confirmed
     by data presented in figure 4. One can also add to this observation with the observations
     of Ruth Towse7; that it is not just enforcement but also the established exploitations
     models exclusive rights & licensing that a copyright regime maintains in a market that
     create moral hazard effect on incumbent firms to rely on the law rather than adopt new
     technologies and business models to deal with new technologies.

                  Increase availability of on-demand/on-line digital content for territorial and cross-
                   border dissemination, by limiting market/licensing miss-conduct that restricts on-
                   demand/on-line availability vs. other formats/platforms.

                         a. Address the complete absence of legal digital alternatives in the first
                            release window. Limit the length of exclusive first release windows and
                            prohibiting the use of exclusive windows for films with less than 100 copies
                            (the number is relative to size of the home cinema market) in the theatres.8
                         b. Assure technology neutral public funding schemes of European
                            audiovisual productions, allowing digital first window to emerge e.g.
                            prohibit digital on-demand/on-line discrimination.

                       depend on contractual negotiations, alone which have important
                       drawbacks for VOD aggregators, as it hollows out the breadth and depth of

              Clearly distinguish between roaming content or remote access to home country
               content access while being in another EU member state from multi-territorial
               licensing.
              Increase market efficiency to clear European works more effectively across
               EU/EES territories by decreasing search, match and clearing transaction costs
               e.g. via a registry, data base or similar.

     Furthermore, Ericsson is not advocating that there must be a condition for the
     creator to produce competition in its own exclusive right. However, once a creator
     has made the free choice to make its work available in the EU internal market,
     concerns may arise when a licensing arrangement harms competition, cultural
     inclusion and/or innovation among entities that would have been actual or likely
     potential competitors in a relevant market in the absence/presence of a particular
     license. For example a restraint in a licensing arrangement may harm
     competition, innovation, cultural diversity and/or consumer choice, for example, if
     it facilitates market division or price-fixing. In addition, license restrictions with
     respect to one market may harm competition in another market by for
     example anticompetitive foreclosing access for the digital on-
     demand/online platforms vs. physical cinema, and DVD physical
     distribution markets.


     Q11 Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
     protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
     subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

     NO

     Ericsson is of the opinion, that in the digitized world where copyright protected content is
     made available on the internet by the right holder, it would limit the availability to the
     content if the provisioning of a hyperlink to such content should be subject to the right
     holder’s authorization. Such limitation for the consumer, distributor or new innovator is in
     Ericsson’s opinion not in proportion to the potential benefits of control for the right
     holder. Furthermore, the provision of a hyperlink does not amount to the transmission
     of an actual work, which is a necessary condition for the consideration of a
     communication to the public. Secondly, it does not amount to an act of communication

     to a new public.9


     Q12 Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
     reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the
     screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under
     specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

     NO

     Ericsson is of the opinion, that in the digitized world where copyright protected content is
     made available on the internet by the right holder, it would limit the availability to the
     content if such viewing of a web-page should be subject to the right holder’s
     authorization. Such limitation for the consumer, platform provider or new innovator is in
     Ericsson’s opinion not in proportion to the potential benefits of control for the right holder.
     Any change towards a more restrictive approach makes no sense at all in the digital age.

     Temporary reproductions are not considered to be copies other than temporary and are
     exempted from the reproduction right in Directive 2001/29, Article 5.1. there is no need
     to modify this rule. Furthermore, everyday interactions of users with digital technology
     give rise to multiple temporary digital reproductions of fragments of content. These are
     essential to the functioning of digital technologies, devices, networks, etc. Hence,
     according to the UK Supreme Court and some academics, requiring permission from the
     newspaper licensing agency for such uses would break down the internet and “would
     make infringers of many millions of ordinary users of the internet across the EU”.

     Q15 Would the creation of registration system at EU level in the identification and
     licensing of works and other subject matter?


     A registration system developed at a EU-wide level would definitely improve the
     identification and licensing of copyright works in digital settings. At the moment copyright
     operates by default, i.e. by mere operation of the law, and does not require any
     registration for the author of a creative work to gain protection and to enjoy the very
     broad exclusive rights conferred by national systems. As a result, today’s copyright ends
     up covering not only traditional types of creative work but also millions of works created
     every day (e.g. Twitter or Facebook posts, blogs, etc) for which nobody claims copyright
     protection.

     Copyright law has traditionally addressed professionally created content. The absence

     of a registration requirement has been seen, also at international level, as an important
     element that ensured a better and immediate protection for the author, who did not need
     to comply with any formalities in order to acquire copyright ownership. With the advent of
     digital technologies, however, creativity has changed radically and has become a much
     broader concept. In addition to professional content, which continues to be produced
     successfully, we have increasingly broader types and amounts of creative content that is
     either produced unprofessionally (i.e. with no expectations of financial gain by amateurs)
     or released on the Internet under licensing schemes (e.g. Creative Commons) through
     which copyright holders relinquish their rights (or a part of their rights) in order the to
     make their works freely accessible. What is known as ‘user-generated content’ is a
     significant element of a portion of content not produced professionally that is
     increasingly shared and transmitted across digital networks, online content platforms
     and social networks. Applying traditional copyright rules to this kind of technology-
     enabled creativity does not seem desirable, and creates legal uncertainty for users and
     right-holders alike.


     Q16 What would be the possible advantages of such system?


     Ericsson believes that the implementation of a registration system in Europe would
     greatly help online intermediaries keep professional content distinct from user-generated
     content (or from content for which their creators do not seek remuneration or copyright
     protection). On the one hand, the formalization of such distinction would enable online
     content providers to let users of their services freely exchange unregistered materials. At
     the same time, content providers could easily adopt technologies aimed at detecting all
     copyright (i.e. registered) content that has not been licensed and make such content not
     available to the platform users. On the other hand, a registration system would give a
     boost to the development and effective implementation of copyright work databases and
     rights identification and management technologies that could be connected to each
     other at European level. As acknowledged by the European Commission in its
     Recommendation of 27 October 2011 on the digitization and online accessibility of
     cultural material and digital preservation, rights information databases are a very
     important tool to bring down transaction costs for rights clearance. If initiatives such as
     the Global Repertoire Database in the music sector were developed more efficiently, in
     close cooperation with all stakeholders, copyright licensing on a EU-wide basis would
     become much easier. It seems obvious to Ericsson that one cannot obtain a license for
     a copyrighted work unless he or she knows who owns the relevant right. Nonetheless, in
     spite of the attempts made by stakeholders to develop voluntary copyright databases,
     these attempts have not succeeded yet. A registration system would make these tools
     and technologies indispensable, so that all parties would have an incentive to have them
     at hand and to update them constantly and efficiently.

     In short, a copyright registration system would provide several advantages:

     •         Right-holders would have a simple, clear and legally effective means to establish


13   © Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson
                                                                                    Public Document
     their authorship and/or ownership.
     •      Society would be better off since registration would also help delimit the public
     domain, consequently facilitating access to freely available creative content;
     •      National copyright registries may constitute a repository of cultural works through
     deposit.


     Q17 What would be the possible disadvantages of such system?


     The biggest disadvantage (or obstacle) in the implementation of a copyright registration
     system in the EU would be the risk of non-compliance with the principle of formality-free
     protection embodied in the Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic
     property, as amended in 1971 by the Paris Act. After this amendment, Article 5(2) of the
     convention provides that copyright shall not be subject to any formality. In spite of the
     formality-free principle set out at international level, in Ericsson’s view EU policy makers
     should consider implementing those forms of registration for copyright works that do not
     seem to enter into conflict with the Berne Convention. For domestic works, for instance,
     any Member State or the EU itself could impose mandatory registration as a condition to
     have access to certain infringement actions or remedies, as it happens in the US.
     Moreover, Member States or the EU could impose such formalities for copyright holders
     to obtain those privileges and additional forms of legal protection that are not
     incorporated in the legal framework (i.e. the Berne Convention) where the principle of
     formality-free protection is provided. In this regard, formalities could be required to
     obtain protection in relation to phonograms, broadcasts, non-original databases and for
     the legitimate application of TPM and/or DRM. Finally, any Member State or the EU
     could condition benefits such as prima facie evidence of ownership of rights on securing
     a certificate of registration.


     Q19 What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in
     the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of
     rights ownership and permissions databases?


     In Ericsson’s view, rights identification systems and repertoire databases are, and will
     continue to be, essential for copyright to apply effectively in sectors such as online
     music, films and other types of digital content. Markets for products like copyright works
     can only function in so far as all information and data concerning rights and their
     ownership is made available openly, i.e. in standardized and interoperable formats.
     Content licensing in the EU Digital Single Market would be greatly facilitated if all content
     owners and licensees had proper access to the data collected in the database.

     One example of such tools is the Global Repertoire Database (GRD) in the music
     sector, which has been supported by the European Commission. The GRD project is
     trying to build up a comprehensive database of global copyright ownership of musical


14   © Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson
                                                                                      Public Document
     works, openly available to songwriters, publishers, collecting societies, and users.
     Unfortunately, a few years after its launch, the GRD is still moving slowly because of the
     uncertainties concerning the conditions under which copyright holders and collecting
     societies will make metadata available to the whole working group.

     Ericsson believes that the European Commission should continue to monitor the
     development and make it sure that data and metadata related to rights ownership and
     permissions databases are effectively made available to commercial and non-
     commercial users and, more generally, to the public by their respective holders. In
     addition, we believe that such data and metadata should become available under open
     access licenses and should also facilitate full interoperability through the adoption of
     non-proprietary and standardized formats.

     Q20 Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
     environment?

     NO - it is absolutely essential that copyright is based on rational economic principles.

     In Ericsson’s view, today’s term of copyright protection in the EU (life plus 70 years) is
     far too long. As a result of the term extension directive of 1993, this term is 20 years
     longer than the minimum term of protection set out under Article 7 of the Berne
     Convention (the author’s life plus 50 years). The main justification for such a long
     duration, for the Convention parties, was that of taking care of the author and his or her
     family. More than a century after the entry into force of the Convention, the fact that
     copyright is normally assigned to, or contractually acquired by, enterprises (i.e. non-
     natural persons) no longer justifies a term of protection whose main parameter is the life
     of the author. Such a parameter is even more flawed if one thinks that authors are not
     the main beneficiaries of copyright protection in the long run, especially in sectors where
     authors are not assisted by collecting societies, which act as authors’ unions helping
     them share their rights with publishers. Enterprises are not people and does not need
     such a long copyright term (see below) in order to make their investments in the creative
     sectors profitable.

     In Ericsson’s view, given that nowadays copyright is more and more often used to
     protect technology, a good parameter for copyright’s term of protection could be that of
     patents, i.e. 20 years. Such a term falls precisely within the duration range that
     academic research has presented as the optimal term of copyright protection, from 15 to
     38 years (see below). These are all term options that are significantly different from the
     current 70 years after the author’s death.

                                                                                     Public Document
     Ericsson would like to provide additional information regarding economics of copyright in
     form of an abstract from Ruth Towse paper10:


            Almost all economists are agreed that the copyright term is now
             inefficiently long with the result that costs of compliance most likely exceed
             any financial benefits from extensions (and it is worth remembering that the
             term of protection for a work in the 1709 Statute of Anne was 14 years with the
             possibility of renewal as compared to 70 years plus life for authors in most
             developed countries in the present, which means a work could be protected for
             well over 150 years).
            One point on which all economists agree is that there can be no possible
             justification for retrospective extension to the term of copyright for existing
             works since it defies the economic logic of the copyright incentive, something
             that nevertheless has been enacted on several occasions.
               A further aspect of the incentive value of copyright has to do with practicalities.
                Copyright law only stipulates the copyright standard and the rights that
                protect authors, but authors almost always have to contract with an
                intermediary or distributor in order to market their work and it is the terms
                of the contract between them that determine the eventual financial reward
                to the author. Research on artists’ total earnings including royalties shows that
                only a small minority earn an amount comparable to national earnings in other
                occupations and only ‘superstars’ make huge amounts. Copyright produces
                limited economic rewards to the ‘ordinary’ professional creator.
               Copyright could become more similar to a patent by having an initial term of
                protection of a work, say of 20 years, renewable for further terms. The advantage
                of this is twofold: it enables a ‘use it or lose it’ regime to function and, more
                relevant to the economics of copyright, it enables the market to function
                better in valuing a work (the vast majority of works, as we know, are anyway out
                of print because they are deemed to have no commercial value while the
                copyright is still valid); knowing that renewal would be necessary would also alter
                contractual terms between creators and intermediaries, thereby improving the
                efficiency of contracting and the prospect of fairer contracts.11

     Furthermore, other academic sources point to additional issues related to current terms
     of protection:

     Lack of evidence of any benefits:
        ● Academic research: optimal term of protection for copyright of 15 to 38 years.
           This is a significant difference from the current 70 years post mortem auctoris.
        ● Extensive terms of protection do not benefit artists - see joint statement by
           European Academics (2009);

          ● Investments in the creation of works are not motivated by rewards 70 years after
            the death of their creators. Even in capital intensive creative sectors, the
            timespan for recouping an investment is much shorter. Extensive terms of
            protection are a windfall.

     Disadvantages from extensive term of protection:
        ● Consumers bear the costs of long terms of protection: Paul Heald showed that
           for major publishers books in copyright have a typical list price of USD 8.90, while
           out of copyright books have a list price of USD 6.3012 and that longer copyright
           terms restrict price competition. Since then, with the development of e-books and
           e-readers, many public domain books are available for free.
        ● Extensive copyright terms limit the availability of content. See NYT, European
           Copyright Laws Lead to Rare Music Releases (December 11, 2013); Paul Heald
           ‘How Copyright Makes Books and Music Disappear’ (2013). “of the 10,027 books
           published in 1930, only 174 were still in print in 2001” (Landes and Posner, The
           Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law, 2003, p. 212)

     Q 64 In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
     application of the private copying and reprography exceptions 13 in the digital
     environment?

     YES.

     The scope, application and level of copyright levies continue to increase rapidly and vary
     substantially between Member States. Industry faces a fragmented market with
     substantial legal and financial uncertainties. An obligation for Member States to file with
     the Commission all their copyright levies and the publication by the Commission of
     exhaustive up-to-date data would greatly increase industry visibility and reduce legal
     uncertainty.

     Clarification on the scope is also needed regarding illegal copies, user-generated-
     content, professional use, public domain, and all other elements which should not fall
     within the scope of the exception.

     Regarding the compensation for acts of private copying, it has to be unambiguously
     confirmed that compensation for private copying is exclusively based on harm and
     therefore should only exist if there is a proven substantial harm to right holders. Also the
     term “harm” must be more precisely defined.

     In the absence of such clarifications on the scope and the application of the exception,

     the levy system is clearly out of control as historic definitions allow unlimited claims from
     collecting societies leading to an unreasonable and unjustified accumulation of levies for
     consumers and industry.

     Finally as noted by Towse :” …copyright levy… has been almost universally opposed by
     economists on the grounds that its remuneration to creators bears no resemblance to
     the market value of the works and therefore could not act as a valid incentive to
     creators”.14 This observation made by most economist points to a failure or a broken
     concept in current copy right system that fails to deliver on key policy objective and that
     should make up for the key basis to grant rights holders with statutory monopoly powers
     with the aim to stimulate investments in intellectual property. In other words, in the
     absence of such economic incentive, the statutory monopoly power is reduced to a
     narrow privilege.



     Q65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context
     of a service that has been licensed by right holders, and where the harm to the
     right holder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?15

     NO

     Licensed copies should not trigger the application of private copying levies. Mr. Vitorino
     concludes that content licensed through online business models, e.g. legal downloading
     and streaming services, should not be subject to levies (“licensed copies should not
     trigger the application of levies. The opposite view would pave the way for double
     payments. Consumers cannot be expected to show understanding for such double
     payments”).

     As he summarizes, right holders have already received compensation for licensed
     content including subsequent copies in the framework of licensing contracts between
     right holders and users. In this respect, it appears that the private copying of licensed
     copies does not cause any additional harm to right holders; therefore no extra
     compensation is justified. Any additional payment on top of the amounts that were
     already paid as part of the license fees would paramount to double-compensation. The
     current private copying system does not consider this fact and creates a significant
     problem of double payment as a result. This is harming the licensing model. Also, the
     CJEU confirmed in its judgment in the VG Wort case that compensation is due only
     when harm is suffered.

     Applying private copying levies to authorized copies of licensed content is in direct
     contradiction with paragraph 4 of Article 6(4) of the Copyright Directive. In such regard,

     15
      This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the
     mediation on private copying and reprography levies

     art. 6(4) provides:

     “4. Notwithstanding the legal protection provided for in paragraph 1, in the absence of
     voluntary measures taken by right holders, including agreements between right holders
     and other parties concerned, Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure
     that right holders make available to the beneficiary of an exception or limitation provided
     for in national law in accordance with Article 5(2)(a), (2)(c), (2)(d), (2)(e), (3)(a), (3)(b) or
     (3)(e) the means of benefiting from that exception or limitation, to the extent necessary
     to benefit from that exception or limitation and where that beneficiary has legal access to
     the protected work or subject-matter concerned.

     A Member State may also take such measures in respect of a beneficiary of an
     exception or limitation provided for in accordance with Article 5(2)(b), unless
     reproduction for private use has already been made possible by right holders to the
     extent necessary to benefit from the exception or limitation concerned and in
     accordance with the provisions of Article 5(2)(b) and (5), without preventing right holders
     from adopting adequate measures regarding the number of reproductions in accordance
     with these provisions.

     The technological measures applied voluntarily by right holders, including those applied
     in implementation of voluntary agreements, and technological measures applied in
     implementation of the measures taken by Member States, shall enjoy the legal
     protection provided for in paragraph 1.

     The provisions of the first and second subparagraphs shall not apply to works or other
     subject-matter made available to the public on agreed contractual terms in such a way
     that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually
     chosen by them”

     Q66 How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online
     services (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to
     have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new
     business models on the one hand and right holders’ revenue on the other?


     It seems incomprehensible to extend the levy system which is not functioning in the
     offline world to online services. The Vitorino report clearly indicates that the attempts to
     broaden the interpretation of the private copying exception not only are to the detriment
     of right holders and legal offers based on license agreements, but are also legally
     questionable and should not be supported.

     Right holders already receive compensation for licensed content including subsequent
     copies in the framework of licensing contracts between right holders and users. Applying
     the unfair copyright levy system to cloud services would result in unjustified triple
     payment by consumers (for the licensed content, for the connected device, and for the
     cloud service).

     It should also be noted that private copying levies are currently applied to devices which
     contain a storage capacity, as it was assumed that since devices with a storage capacity
     can be used to copy protected content they should all be subject to levies. In the case of
     access based cloud services, storage capacity is not needed and applying levies on
     them is thus irrelevant.

     One of the main advantages of cloud services is their global nature; therefore imposing
     territorial/national levy systems on global services seems unfeasible and absurd,
     especially considering the principles of the Single Market.

     Cloud computing allows easier access to digital content for consumers and provides
     artists with new distribution models. In the digital era, consumers need to be able to
     access digital content from several connected devices at all times and from anywhere.
     European consumers and internet users would be the first victims of the imposition of
     levies on cloud services since prices would most certainly raise because of levies.
     Companies of all sizes, which are increasingly using cloud services, would also face this
     consequence.

     Imposing levies on cloud services would also have negative impact on European cloud
     service providers, as the obligation to pay levies added to new administrative burden
     would significantly limit their competitiveness in the global market. The negative impact
     on new business models would be immediate, as levies would raise prices and thus limit
     the attractiveness, competitiveness and future development of business models based
     on new technologies.



     Q 67 Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for
     products subject to levies?

     Visibility of the levy in the invoice of those products that are subject to levies would bring
     increased transparency and awareness among customers even if this could also
     increase the risk of “copyright levies shopping” between Member States. Ericsson
     believes that the burden of providing information should be borne by those who benefit
     from the revenues of the levies. In case the EC decides otherwise, we believe that
     proportionality requires that the costs are borne by rights-holders. Distributors should not
     have to pay copyright levies and bear the financial burden of informing end-users.

     Q 71 If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the
     levy system, how would these problems best be solved?

     Regarding the issue of liability for payment of levies, Ericsson recommends
     maintaining the existing liability regime:

         shifting liability to retailers was rejected by Member States during the
          Competitiveness Council of 29 May 201316
         maintaining liability with manufacturers in combination with predictable ex ante
          exemption schemes was identified as one possible option in the Vitorino report 17,
          (while shifting liability to retail was the other option).
         maintaining liability with manufacturers/importers has also been suggested in the
          Castex report18 and is supported by most JURI Committee members 19
         manufacturers market shares are more concentrated and consistent across member
          states than relevant retail market shares20
         a few, concentrated, global manufacturers are better equipped ( due to consistent
          pan-European market presence, better resourced and operate on higher economies
          of scale) to come up with an efficient common pan-European technical solution to
          collect levies effectively than retailers, especially SMB, who are less concentrated
          and less homogenous across the internal market.
         the case made by those promoting shift to retail is constructed on complex
          argumentation based on several interdependent policy actions being implemented
          beforehand, e.g. “if and then” assumptions about policy implementations regarding:
          common definitions, improved governance, improved tariff negotiation process,
          greater transparency and overall simplification. Obviously, the necessity of such
          complex argumentation regarding what would seem to be a seemingly straight
          forward issue, questions fundamentally the merits and sensibility of the case for a
          shift.


     Respect for rights

     The current civil enforcement framework at European level remains sound and is based
     on principles that are still relevant today as confirmed by the recent European Court of
     Justice (ECJ) decisions. The European Court of Justice has given important and useful
     indications in two well-known cases (Promusicae and Tele2), asking Member States and
     their respective authorities to take measures that, while balancing both rights, should
     respect the principle of proportionality. The European Court of Justice decisions imply
     also that Internet service providers cannot assume the responsibility of balancing rights
     and becoming controllers of the Internet. As a consequence, ETNO believes that the

     16
        Mlex, 30 May 2013: “EU Ministers reject proposal to have retailers collect copyright levies”.

     enforcement framework, completed by the ECJ ruling, achieves the right balance
     between copyright and the right to privacy and protection of personal data.

     The balance between fundamental rights should include also other fundamental rights,
     e.g. the presumption of innocence, right to a fair trial, the confidentiality of
     communications. In addition and since the SABAM case, the European Court of Justice
     has also considered the right to conduct business as a fundamental right that should be
     taken into consideration during the overall balancing process. The Advocate General
     Villalon in his opinions delivered with regard to the cases Case C 70/10 and C-314/12
     has touched on a further important element which is the question of a concrete legal
     basis necessary in case the enforcement measure is restricting fundamental rights. This
     is indeed a very important point as it would guarantee a democratic process and debate
     before imposing measures such as the filtering of systems or blocking obligations on
     ISPs. In a recent judgment in Germany (21.11.2013 OLG Hamburg 5 U 68/10), it was
     confirmed that any measure imposing blocking or filtering mechanisms on an access
     provider in Germany must be based on a law defining in detail how the access to the
     infringing content should be impeded.

     The current enforcement system, under the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement
     Directive (IPRED), has played and continues to play a crucial role in providing rights-
     holders with a high level of intellectual property right protection. This legal text is based
     upon principles that remain valid today and that should be maintained. Any future
     eventual revision should be coherent with the current intermediary liability regime. In
     addition, any reinforcement of the contribution of intermediaries in the fight against illegal
     file sharing must remain compliant with the right to a presumption of innocence, the right
     to a fair trial, the right to privacy and the right to the confidentiality of communications.

     Finally, the enforcement of intellectual property rights should not be seen as the sole
     solution having just one dimension. A more holistic view is necessary, focusing on:

            Increasing availability of lawful digital content is the best way to fight “free”
              as there is an inverted relationship between lawful and unlawful access to
              content:

            Economists have expressed concerns that copyright has a moral hazard
             effect on incumbent creative firms, by encouraging them to rely on
             enforcement of the law rather than adopt new technologies and business models
             to deal with new technologies21 .

     Hence, enforcement should not become a tool to protect businesses from competition,
     changing business realities and changes in consumer exactions, hereby allowing them
     to continue to hold on to outdated business models.

             Enforcement must be facts based

     It is absolutely essential that enforcement debate and policy is not based on
     manufactured claims, exaggerations and deceptions that will in the long run risk
     resulting in a negative public sentiment concerning intellectual property. Empirical data
     on the impact of copyright infringement over the last two decades is deeply contested
     and in some case to such a level that it is being ridiculed. This is highly undesirable
     development for the perception of copyright and by extension intellectual property in
     general by the broader public.

             Ineffective solutions should not be pursued by policy makers.


     “There is no evidence demonstrating a causal connection between graduated response and reduced
     infringement. If “effectiveness” means reducing infringement, then it is not effective” 22

     “There is no convincing proof that any variety of graduated response increases the size of the
     legitimate market. If “effectiveness” means increasing the market, then it is not effective.”23


             Enforcement solutions should be targeted at the organized sources polluting
              networks with pirated content – a review of PPP polluter pays principle as
              established in environmental law should be considered.

     MPAA: “Approximately ninety percent of newly released movies that are pirated can be
     traced to thieves who use a digital recording device in a movie theater to literally steal
     the image and/or sound off the screen”.

     In summary, Ericsson believes that a rethinking of the release windows mechanisms is
     necessary, an introduction of a premium digital window in conjuncture with
     physical window is absolutely necessary. In a recent study published by Spotify one
     of the questions was examining the impact of holdout strategies on sales and illegal
     torrent volumes. The result was that “artists who delayed their release on Spotify
     suffered higher levels of piracy than those who did not”. (Spotify report: Adventures in
     the Netherlands: Spotify, Piracy and the new Dutch experience). The availability of the
     most recent content from legal sources online would therefore be a very effective tool to
     reduce copyright infringements. Furthermore, if further enforcement measures are
     required, it is time that policy makers target the sources that pollute the
     communication networks with unlawful content.
