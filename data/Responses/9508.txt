PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF:


Name:
CISAC - International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers

CISAC is the umbrella organisation representing collective management organisations
(CMOs) for authors worldwide. Founded in 1926, CISAC is a non-governmental, not for
profit organisation based in Paris, France, with regional offices in Hungary, Chile, Burkina
Faso and China. CISAC counts 227 authors’ societies as its members. These societies are
based in 120 countries, including EU Member States. Together, CISAC societies around the
world represent over 3 million creators from all artistic disciplines including music, film,
literature, drama and visual arts.

Music composers and lyricists, filmmakers, screenwriters, painters, illustrators, sculptors,
book writers, journalists, playwrights and other creators shape the world in which we live and
enrich our lives with their creativity. CISAC’s key mission is to promote the interests of these
creators and safeguard the future of creative activity and cultural diversity, in Europe and
around the world. A main part of the work CISAC does is through its Councils of Creators
and other creator-led forums and think-tanks. CISAC is constantly working to enrich the
modern copyright debate and to secure a position for creators in the international, regional and
national scenes.

As the umbrella organisation for authors’ societies, CISAC fosters the global network of
collective management and promotes good governance, transparency and best practices
among its members. Through a network of representation agreements signed between its
members, CISAC societies can administer and license both local and foreign repertoire in the
defined territories. This ensures that creative content is available globally and that royalties
flow to creators wherever they are. CISAC strives to enlarge the global network of authors’
societies, by supporting the creation of new societies and offering them its political, legal,
logistical and technical expertise and assistance.

CISAC constantly works to facilitate and improve accurate identification of works and
prompt distribution of royalties to creators. This is achieved through the operation of central
and distributed databases containing creative works’ information for musical and audiovisual
repertoires, and through the development of industry standards for information exchange.
With the worldwide coverage of its Common Information System (CIS), CISAC provides its
members with the necessary means to protect their repertoire in the physical as well as digital
environment. Following the launch of CISAC’s “CIS-Net” in October 2004, authors’ societies
around the world can now exchange information with each other concerning creative works in
real-time. CISAC also constantly works to standardise the information exchange between
societies in order to improve the efficiency of their operations. To that end, CISAC manages
ISO international standard numbers for the identification of works, such as ISWC (music),
ISAN (audio visual) and ISTC (literary), and parties linked to the creative process (IPI).

I.         Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services
from anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management2 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services3; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online

    This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.

  Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.

Collective management is essential for the development and availability of cross-border
and multi-territory digital offerings. The new Directive on Collective Management of
Rights establishes rules which are aimed at facilitating multi-territory licensing of rights
in musical works for online use. It would make sense to allow this Directive to achieve its
goals prior to any further legislative initiatives in this area.

CISAC understands from its members’ reporting that the number of multi-territory licences
for music that have been requested within the EU is not high. However, with more than 300
services already available for consumers to access, the EU has a choice of digital offerings
that is more varied and more numerous than that which is available in the US market. The
licenses that are sought from CISAC members are primarily in the field of music. In other
creative areas, for example in the audio-visual field, works are created under business models
that do not easily accommodate multi-territory structures and in any event, services offering
this category of content typically target specific markets and therefore do not seek multi-
territory licenses. The reasons for the difference between music and audiovisual content with
respect to cross-border availability lie in the way in which audiovisual works are funded and
produced. In addition, in the audiovisual sector authors are not the ones controlling the
distribution of the works (due to transfer of rights from the author to the producer).

For musical works, CISAC member societies control the communication to the public right
(including the making available right) of their members. Authors’ music societies and their
music publisher members (who, in some territories, retain the reproduction right and in others
entrust its administration to the societies) license multi-territory services on a regular basis.
Multi-territory licensing solutions tend to be sought by large players with a dominant position
in the market. To promote and facilitate a range of legal offerings for the delivery of digital
music, CISAC member societies are offering varied and tailored solutions irrespective of the
size of the prospective licensee. Also, licences offered by CISAC members are non-exclusive,
thereby ensuring a varied and competitive market where the conditions exist for the entry of
new players.

CISAC would refer the Consultation to the on-line licensing section of the United Kingdom’s
music authors’ society PRS for Music, chosen because of the desirability of the English
language repertoire and thus most often sought to be made available across national borders.
(http://www.prsformusic.com/users/broadcastandonline/onlinemobile/Pages/default.aspx). On
offer from PRS’ site are options for licensing for digital music services, general entertainment
services, mobile and advertising & promotions. Within these categories is a range of licensing
options that address not just multi-territory offerings, but also services with varying levels of
revenues as well as boutique or specialist operations offering defined, limited genres or
repertoires. The multi-territory options range across different activities such as permanent
downloads, music on demand, interactive webcasting, subscription and non-subscription
services and services dedicated to a single artist’s work. The latter is in response to the
changing music creation and ownership patterns which have been characterised by creators
retaining all rights; such bespoke licensing services enable remuneration conduit to the
unsigned artist.



                                                                                                7
                    Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



Under the Licences for Europe initiative it was the Commission’s decision after the mid-term
plenary meeting not to hold any further working group meetings in the music sector. One
might infer that this fact signals satisfaction in the status of multi-territory licensing in the EU
-- at least for musical works.

Any perceived issues within the currently-available licensing solutions are mostly addressed
via the Directive on Collective Rights Management. As this directive proposes a structure
which is aimed at facilitating cross-border online licensing of music repertoire, it would make
sense to allow this solution to develop and for the market to adjust, prior to the introduction of
any additional rules in this area. At this stage, it is CISAC’s view that there is no
demonstrable need for further and additional solutions within the copyright framework.

We would also note that the availability of cross-border multi-territory licenses is directly
linked to business models, and therefore not dependent upon the copyright system. Among the
relevant considerations are the following:
‐ Choices made by individual music service operators relating to local language, local
    marketing and advertising strategies;
‐ The difficulties of integrating telecoms companies’ roaming service patterns and the
    reality of cross-border availability of internet or broadband connections;
‐ Problems with cross border electronic payment services for ecommerce;
‐ The age group of heavy consumers of music services, who do not necessarily have the
    resources to manage the complexity and costs of cross-border transactions;
‐ High levels of piracy, aggravated by patchy enforcement from larger ISPs in removing
    links to unauthorised content. This acts as disincentives to investors in new entrants to the
    market.
Efforts to facilitate growth in the digital market and the number of cross-border services for
the delivery of creative content must consider all of the above elements, and cannot be limited
to copyright issues.

In the case of audiovisual works, different licensing patterns exist. These arise principally
from the interaction of two factors; namely the global assignment of audio visual authors’
(directors and screen writers) rights to the producer with no subsequent control of licensing
decisions (in itself creating difficulties in accessing transparent accounting and revenue
participation) and the different regimes prevailing across individual Member States which
affect both the access to secondary income arising through the various CMOs’ and the tax
consequences of cross-border payments through the CMO system. It is also worth noting that
the market for audiovisual works tends to be a local one due to linguistic and cultural
distinctions and as a result, the cross border circulation of audiovisual works is more limited.

CISAC’s audio-visual society members operating in the EU formed a working group under
SAA’s (Society of Audiovisual Authors) umbrella, titled FRAME, to explore online licensing.
This group, which has been active since 2011, identified several distinct problems:
‐ The wholesale global assignment of AV authors’ rights to the AV producer has the effect
   that few AV authors (via their CMOs) retain the right to authorise the online
   dissemination of their works – cross-border or otherwise.
‐ Different regimes prevail in different Member States in respect of the collection and
   distribution of secondary remuneration intended to reward AV authors for ongoing
   exploitation. For example, in some EU Member States secondary remuneration can arise


                                                                                                   8
                    Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



    by statute whereas, in contrast, in the UK, despite a director being afforded co-authorship
    status by statute, secondary remuneration for video and foreign exploitation of their works
    have to be negotiated with producers and some (but not all) broadcasters every three
    years.
‐   Lack of a harmonised tax regime across the Union makes cross-border licences expensive
    because of double taxation. Some Member States revenue services will not grant a CMO
    the benefit of double taxation treaties on the basis that individual right holders and not the
    CMO are the beneficiaries of the right and should individually receive the benefit. This is
    particularly disadvantageous where lump sum payments are made without express usage
    information of individual author’s works being provided.
‐   FRAME remains uncertain concerning the extent to which EU competition law may
    prejudice cross-border solutions being sought between CMOs.

In the area of visual art, similar initiatives have been adopted to set-up multi-territorial online
licenses, specifically addressed at cultural institutions, museums, advertisers and other
commercial users.


4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?

Collective management organisations representing authors already provide effective and
flexible licensing solutions that support multi-territory offerings across varied service
models.

In order to support further development of the digital market and facilitate licensing of works
in digital form, more responsibility from those who control the networks is required. It would
be beneficial to place on some Internet intermediaries a general obligation and responsibility
to address unlicensed use of copyright works taking place over their services. This would also
motivate these intermediaries to seek licenses from CMOs for activities covered under the
rights granted to creators. However, such proposal is not directly linked to the Information
Society Directive but concerns the modernization of the E-commerce Directive.

Further, CISAC recommends a clear EU policy on the cross-border tax treatment of
collectively managed revenues including the express allowance of double tax treaty benefits
to CMOs that manage rights on behalf of individual right owners.

More specifically, as regards the concerns that relate to particular categories of repertoire,
CISAC would refer the consultation to the detailed positions provided by our European
groupings – GESAC (for music repertoire), SAA (for audiovisual repertoire) and EVA (for
visual arts).

5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the

  NO – Please explain by giving examples

Collective management, in particular in the field of music, is essential for the development
and availability of cross-border and multi-territory digital offerings. CMOs provide flexible
and transparent solutions to cross-border licensing of creative works, and provide certainty of
ownership where exclusive assignments from creators prevail.

As mentioned above, the number of multi-territory licences for music that have been
requested within the EU is not high. However, more than 300 services are already available
for consumers, through authors’ CMOs licensing, many of which operating on a multi-
territory basis. The choice of digital offerings in EU is more varied and more numerous than
that which is available in the US market.

7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  NO – Please explain

The existing EU copyright system supports the cross-border availability of content in the
Single Market. For their part, authors’ EU CMOs are playing a key role in providing
effective and flexible licensing solutions that support multi-territory offerings across
varied service models. The key to increasing the cross-border availability of creative
content lies in ensuring an adequate level of protection to creators for the use of their
works. The standard of “high level of protection” set up by the Copyright Directive
should remain the starting point for any consideration on this issue.

CISAC notes that Recital 4 of the Information Society Directive establishes that: “A
harmonised legal framework on copyright and related rights, through increased legal
certainty and while providing for a high level of protection of intellectual property, will foster
substantial investment in creativity and innovation, including network infrastructure, and lead
in turn to growth and increased competitiveness of European industry, both in the area of
content provision and information technology and more generally across a wide range of


                                                                                                10
                        Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



industrial and cultural sectors. This will safeguard employment and encourage new job
creation.”

Recital 9 follows the same approach by providing that: “Any harmonisation of copyright and
related rights must take as a basis a high level of protection, since such rights are crucial to
intellectual creation. Their protection helps to ensure the maintenance and development of
creativity in the interests of authors, performers, producers, consumers, culture, industry and
the public at large. Intellectual property has therefore been recognised as an integral part of
property.”

The principle of “high level of protection” for creators and the underlying justification for it
remain valid and should be maintained. It is this protection that ensures continued investment
of skill, labour and financial resources in creative activity; motivates authors to create works
and publish them; and incentivises commercial entities to disseminate creative works to the
general public. This critical element of the EU copyright framework must remain the guiding
principle in the current review.

For further specific discussion which reflects the views of individual sectors – music,
audiovisual and visual art – CISAC would refer the Consultation to the submissions of
GESAC (for music repertoire), SAA (for audiovisual repertoire) and EVA (for visual arts).



B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what
needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC8 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software9 and databases10.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders11 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.

 Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

 Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
10
  Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
11
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.

The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies12, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks13. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

                 1.       The act of “making available”

Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public14. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.


8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content
is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES

The scope of the making available right, as established under the Information Society
Directive and interpreted by EU courts, is sufficiently clear.

As regards the definition of the “making available right”, the elements of this right are
provided by art. 3.1. of the Information Society Directive. This provision recognises acts of
“making available” as part of the broader right of “communication to the public” granted to
authors. The two elements of the right are the act of “making available” and the concept of
“public”. With respect to the act of “making available”, as clarified by the CJEU, the act
takes place where “a work is made available to a public in such a way that the persons
forming that public may access it, irrespective of whether they avail themselves of that

12
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
13
  The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
14
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).


                                                                                                              12

opportunity” (judgment of 13 February 2014 in case C-466/12, paragraph 19). This principle
had been previously established by the CJEU in the Rafael Hoteles judgement (Case
C-306/05, paragraph 43). The second key element is the concept of “public”. Where a
protected work is made available to a person in a private sphere it is not considered as
communicated to the public. In the absence of a precise concept of “public”, one of the key
criteria chosen in decisions issued by the CJEU is the private or public nature of the place
where the communication takes place is immaterial (Case C-306/05, paragraph 50). The
dissemination to “a public” is a necessary condition for the application of the right of making
available. Thus, where a protected work is available to the different potential users of a
website an act of communication to the public takes place and the right of making available is
implemented where such availability occurs.

If the idea behind any limitation of the making available right is to justify the application of
the “country of origin” principle (as set out in the Satellite and Cable Re-transmissions
Directive, 93/83 EEC), it must be recalled that the 2001 Information Society Directive did not
transpose this principle, which is specific for satellite broadcasting, to the making available
right of copyright works. On the contrary, art. 3 of the Information Society Directive
expressly grants authors “the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit any communication to
the public of their works, by wire or wireless means, including the making available to the
public of their works in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place
and at a time individually chosen by them.” Thus, the “making available right” clearly takes
place in every country where the work is made available to the public so the members of
the public can reach them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. Only with
the aspect of the “access of the members of the public from the place and at a time
individually chosen by them”, the making available right makes sense. The application of the
“country of origin” principle would override basic principles of copyright protection when it
comes to online transmissions. It would also encourage a “race-to-the bottom” among content
providers to establish themselves in the territory where they will benefit from the most
favourable conditions to exploit a work.

A study recently commissioned by the European Commission to DeWolf & Partners in
collaboration with CRIDS - hereinafter called as the “DeWolf Report - confirmed that the
country of origin approach is not appropriate. It does not resolve any of the problems
identified and would lead to “forum shopping” to find the most favourable regimes.

9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of
the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether
you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred
your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
availability of injunctive relief15)?
     NO

Our response to Question 8 above has largely addressed this question. Territorial
coverage or division of copyright is a matter of contract for authors and licensees.
Unique global identifiers and databases go a long way towards eliminating rights-

15
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.


                                                                                                  13

recognition problems. It is not the copyright regime that is creating opacity in respect of
the scope of the making available right.

Collective management structures provide flexible and transparent solutions to cross-border
licensing of creative works, and provide certainty of ownership where exclusive assignments
from creators prevail. CMOs offer (subject to permitted territorial limitations specific to the
industry financing models) trans-national licensing options for prospective licensees,
particularly in respect of making creative works available to consumers. Collective
management has the added bonus of enabling the creator to influence internal policy of
CMOs, and to elect their colleagues to represent their interests. In addition, the non-profit
nature of a CMOs removes from the process the need to satisfy the interests of shareholders
whose motives are profits and financial gain.

               2.     Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10. [In particular if you are a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
  NO

Communication to the public (including making available) and reproduction are
separate rights and this distinction is nothing new. It has not created any practical
problems, and rightholders are cooperating in order to offer the set of rights needed for
legitimate offerings of digital content.

As a matter of international treaties and local laws, the two broad rights’ categories
(communication and reproduction) have long been established as distinct acts, are licensed as
such, and seldom questioned in terms of operational convenience. The exercise of the
reproduction right in conjunction with the communication/making available right is
determined by the action of the consumer or end user. Their licensing in conjunction and
independently has long been accommodated in the EU (and elsewhere) by CMOs, by
companies operating on a profit-making basis and by the two parties acting in co-operation
for the benefit of the end user and/or the consumer.

The situation as to the vesting of the reproduction right varies according to individual
practices in the Member State. For example, in Continental Europe where the droit d’auteur
legal tradition prevails, both rights are, by and large, vested in the local CMO for collective
licensing. Collectively licensed reproduction revenues are paid to the authors direct by the
CMO in accordance with the agreed proportions determined in their music publishing
agreements. In the United Kingdom (and other common law territories) the reproduction
right can be exercised both by the music publisher for bi-lateral licences and collectively
under an agency remit granted to a CMO (e.g. where the reproduction right is required for
broadcast or other activities). The revenues collected by the CMO are paid in their entirety to

                                                                                              14
                         Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



the music publisher and shared with the author by the publisher according to their contractual
agreement.

To a large extent, the difficulties arising as a result of two interested parties managing the two
rights involved in digital exploitation arose from decisions taken by certain players following
a Commission initiative. In response to the Commission’s own Recommendation of 18th
October 2005 on cross-border licensing, the structure and source of reproduction right
licensing for music has become more complex, since major rights owners have pulled their
rights from CMOs. However, in response to these developments, major music publishers, a
collective of independents and CMOs have been granting multi-territory licences from a
series of collaborative entities set up specifically for the purpose of granting on-line and
mobile licences throughout the EU. These include IMPEL (licensing of Anglo-American
repertoire owned by independent music publishers on a pan-European basis); PAECOL
(license of Sony/ATV repertoire for Anglo-American works); CELAS (EMI’s Anglo-
American repertoire); PEL (a Sony/ATV/ SGAE initiative for the Latin-American repertoire);
DEAL (Universal’s Anglo-American repertoire and SACEM’s catalogue).

This cooperation between CMOs and music publishers is a demonstration of the manner in
which CMOs can respond flexibly to market changes and the Collective Right Management
Directive should, it is hoped, also contribute to this process.

The “bundling of rights” proposed is undefined in the question, but CISAC would caution that
any legislation to bolt together long standing separate rights is unlikely to be achievable,
because of international copyright treaties’ obligations. It would also threaten the balance
struck between the stakeholders through the effect of contracts between CMOs and authors,
CMOs and music publishers, and CMOs and audio-visual producers/users for directors and
screenwriters.

                    3.      Linking and browsing

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU16 in w hich the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU17 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

     11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected
     under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the

                    Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



    YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
 specific circumstances, and why

The authorisation of the rightholder is required whenever the linking results in a
communication to the public of the copyright-protected work. Any other approach
would undermine the right of communication to the public, jeopardise creators’
interests and threaten the continued development of the digital market.

Although a full analysis has not yet been carried out, CISAC refers to the first judgment
handed down by the CJEU concerning hyperlinking, the Svensson judgment of 13 February
2014).

In that decision, the court recalled the two cumulative criteria for there to be a communication
to the public, i.e. (i) an act of communication of the work, and (ii) the communication of such
work to the public. The court also specified that the provision on a website of clickable links
to works freely available on another website does not constitute such an act of communication
to the public.

Within the framework of a communication of the same work as the initial communication, the
Court considers that the term 'public' refers not only to an indeterminate and fairly large
number of potential recipients, but also to a “new public”. This “new public” includes
members of the public which were not taken into account by the right holders when they
authorized the initial communication. When dealing with a website which is not restricted to
subscribers only, the term “public” by definition would cover all potential internet users. This
interpretative approach is not obvious insofar as it is possible to consider that Internet users do
not form an indistinct whole, the public directed towards a protected work thanks to a link
provided by a website B being different than the public consulting directly such work on a
website A. It does not take into account neither the reality of the advertising practices which
are generally targeted depending on the awaited public, nor the behaviour of website
providers which often seek to draw a new public thanks to an optimization of their referral.

Nevertheless, the CJEU took care to specify that the authorisation of the right holders remains
necessary where the link enables access to a public "which was not taken account by the
copyright holders when they authorized the initial communication" (paragraph 31). Such a
public would constitute a “new public” compared to the members of the public which were
initially taken into account by the right holders.

Thus, the right holders retain the possibility to take measures restricting to a determined
public access to a website, in which case any link enabling a larger public to access the
content of such website must be authorized by them.

12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a
work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
  Under certain circumstances – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in
general, or under specific circumstances, and why



                                                                                                 16
                          Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



The existing framework under the Information Society Directive, and further
clarifications provided by the European Court, sufficiently address the issue and
provide the necessary clarity as to the situations where temporary reproduction requires
a license.

Article 5 (1) of Directive 2001/29 EC states that there is no infringement where a copy is
made that is (i) temporary (ii) transient or incidental or (iii) an integral and essential part of a
technological process. In addition there is the requirement that (iv) the sole purpose of the
copy is to enable the transmission of that work in a network between third parties by an
intermediary or a lawful use of the work and which (v) has no independent economic
significance. In Infopaq18 the CJEU ruled that to qualify as transient, a copy must be deleted
automatically as an integral part of the technological process concerned and without any
further human intervention. In Infopaq II19 the CJEU set out four clear conditions whereby an
exception to the reproduction right might apply (in respect of both copyright and moral right
concerns) namely where uses: (i) were an integral and essential part of the technological
process even if they initiate and terminate those processes and arise through human
intervention; (ii) have the sole purpose of enabling the lawful use of a protected work or
subject matter; (iii) must not have an independent economic existence beyond that derived
from the lawful use; and (iv) do not modify the copyright work. Where these conditions are
not met, and the exception would not apply, the act performed would fall within the scope of
activities which should be authorised by the rightholder. It follows from the rule under the
Information Society Directive, and the clarifications provided by the Court, that under certain
circumstances, authorisation of the rightholder for temporary reproduction is relevant.

It is worth noting that viewing protected works on a website may involve other rights as well.
Where a communication to the public and making available of a work under Art 3 of the
Information Society Directive take place, this should also be taken into consideration in
deciding whether an authorisation of the right holder is needed or not.

                    4.       Download to own digital content

Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)20. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)21. This raises difficult questions,

  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to


                                                                                                               17

notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
   YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
   NO
   NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.

The resale of digital content would necessarily involve an exercise of the communication
to the public and reproduction right. As such, allowing such activity would not only
undermine the exclusive rights of creators, but also have devastating consequences for
the development of the legitimate digital market.

From CISAC’s perspective the issue of resale of digital copies merits two considerations:
First, a consideration of the principle of exhaustion of rights within the EU and its application
to the re-sale of digital content; second, the impact upon the market as a result of the re-sale of
digital content.

Exhaustion as a legal principle applies to the distribution right, in support of the Union’s
policy of the free movement of goods. Similar to the “first sale” doctrine in the US (as
discussed below with reference to the Redigi case), the EU exhaustion rule enables the owner
of a physical copy to dispose of this copy without specific permission from the creator. The
exhaustion principle takes effect at the point where a copyright work is put onto the market by
the right owner – that is, physical copies are distributed for the first time. According to
Recitals 28 and 29 of the Information Society Directive, control of copies applies only to
tangible articles, and not to services. It follows that the question of exhaustion does not arise
in the case of services in general and on-line services in particular.

The owner’s right to control any communication to the public (including making available to
the public), as well as the right to control direct, indirect, temporary, or permanent
reproduction in any form and by any means, is established under Articles 2 and 3 of the
Information Society Directive. These two rights encompass the element of interactivity that is
characteristic of access to digital content. Article 3 (3) of the Information Society Directive
expressly excludes the application of the exhaustion principle to communication/making

emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).


                                                                                                             18
                         Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



available. The principle of exhaustion applies only where the seller disposes of the original
physical copy of the work, which is not the case in online distribution scenarios. In online
transmissions, when the act of reproduction in the form of a download onto a hard drive
occurs, the activity is still classified as a service – arising as it does from the digital access
provided by the online service (see Recital 29 above).

We know that the making available right takes place where transmission or retransmission
occurs over the internet – and if the TV Catchup case22 is followed where the CJEU rules that
each new transmission and retransmission of a work constitutes communication – the
re-sending of a digital file over the internet will fall foul of Article 3 (1) of Directive 2001/29
EC.

The resale of a digital file was considered in case C-128/11 Oracle v. UsedSoft. The case, on
the face of it, appears to present questions when considering the re-sale of digital files of
music, say, or an audio visual work because the software in question was discussed in terms
of its existence as a copy and not considered a service. But there are clear grounds for
distinguishing the case on its facts. First, these proceedings were in relation to the provisions
of Directive 2009/24 EC for the protection of computer programmes. The Information Society
Directive expressly states, at Article 1 (2) (a), that its terms affect in no way Community
provisions relating to the protection of computer programmes. Usedsoft re-stated that the
principle of exhaustion was an autonomous, Union-wide principle and individual Member
States had no discretion as to its implementation nationally. The twin acts of downloading and
the conclusion of the user’s licence agreement in Usedsoft was determined to be “an
indivisible whole” (para. 44). This and the vexing terms of paragraphs 47 and 4823 can be
overcome by recalling that Oracle and the software users had concluded individual licence
agreements permitting the making of 25 copies of the programme and the right to access via
Oracle ongoing maintenance and updates of same. This does not reflect the single, discrete,
final nature of the transaction in purchasing a digital music or audio visual file via an internet
service. In addition, the computer programmes in themselves were in this case tools to be
applied dynamically, subject to augmentation or alteration, in the course of a business to
progress the licensee’s other business operations. No reasonable business user would believe
that a digital music file, for example, lawfully acquired by them carried with it the lawful
right, for example, to synchronise that musical work and sound recording to a Bacardi
advertisement destined to be televised.

   47. It makes no difference, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, whether the copy of the
computer program was made available to the customer by the rightholder concerned by means of a download
from the rightholder’s website or by means of a material medium such as a CD-ROM or DVD. Even if, in the
latter case too, the rightholder formally separates the customer’s right to use the copy of the program supplied
from the operation of transferring the copy of the program to the customer on a material medium, the operation
of downloading from that medium a copy of the computer program and that of concluding a licence agreement
remain inseparable from the point of view of the acquirer, for the reasons set out in paragraph 44 above. Since
an acquirer who downloads a copy of the program concerned by means of a material medium such as a CD-
ROM or DVD and concludes a licence agreement for that copy receives the right to use the copy for an
unlimited period in return for payment of a fee, it must be considered that those two operations likewise involve,
in the case of the making available of a copy of the computer program concerned by means of a material
medium such as a CD-ROM or DVD, the transfer of the right of ownership of that copy.
48. Consequently, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the transfer by the copyright holder to a
       customer of a copy of a computer program, accompanied by the conclusion between the same parties of a user
       licence agreement, constitutes a ‘first sale … of a copy of a program’ within the meaning of Article 4(2) of Directive
       2009/24.

Exhaustion applies to the distribution of lawful copies and not to the reproduction of fresh
copies of protected works. The Redigi case in the USA in 2013 addressed exactly this
question – i.e. new copies of MP3 files being made available for re-sale (Capitol Records v
Redigi (No 12, Civ. 95 RJS)). In the US, however, there is no guidance as in the EU on the
restricted act of making available (the making available act being covered under the
distribution right in US law); therefore the courts had to consider the facts in terms of the two
restricted acts of reproduction and distribution. US courts have long differentiated between
the digital music file and the “phonorecord” (or physical sound carrier)24 but classifying them
both as physical renditions. Citing the “material object” requirement of the national copyright
legislation when ruling on P2P file sharing cases25 the two versions of reproduction were both
categorised as such as a matter of physics. And, notwithstanding the deletion of the original
MP3 file on re-sale, it was the sequence of new copies, on Redigi’s servers, on the buyer’s
hard drive that was held to be unlawful reproductions – it being impossible for the same
material object to be transferred over the Internet. First sale, or exhaustion in our case, only
applies to physical reproductions that are lawfully made.

Secondly, as argued in the ALAI Report on linking, where discussion of the WIPO Copyright
Treaty (WCT) is used to consider the extent of the making available right, the right is
technologically neutral and “communication to the public may also come about in a one-to-
one communication on the Internet…”26 As a result, re-sale falls within the making available
right. To allow resale of digital files as an exception would enable the development of a
secondary market that would have the potential to consume the market for the legitimate
exploitation by right owners of the copyright works and defeat a longstanding purpose of
protecting copyright works altogether. Unlike physical formats which were used in the past
for the distribution of music content, in the digital world there is no degradation of quality
with any subsequent copying. This is both their attraction to a consumer and the challenge for
the right owner. Scarcity has, until digital dissemination, enabled pricing and the growth of a
market for cultural products containing the work of authors and performers, and rewarded
those who invest in the embodiment and marketing and distribution of such activity. The
value of the cultural industries to the European Union would be cannibalised by legislative
support for unfettered re-sale of digital files of cultural products – which would appear to
CISAC to be entirely self-defeating. Current challenges resulting from unlawful P2P and
BitTorrent services across all sectors of the cultural industries demonstrate the damage to a
valuable industry from the unlawful availability of unremunerated copyright works.

C. Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good
idea?

Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute27. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered28.

15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     NO
See answer to Q 17 below.

Well-publicised information that directs consumers and users to the network of ownership
data and licensing sources which already exist or are in development (for example, the orphan
works database) would be of great help to the cultural industries of the individual EU Member
States and to the market as a whole.

16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
………………………………………………………………………………………………
17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

The establishment of an EU registration system is unnecessary, would result in
duplication and could lead to confusion. CISAC and its societies already operate
databases on a global scale that provide a complete information set which fully supports
market needs.

The creation of a new registration system at EU level would not be efficient, given that digital
dissemination occurs in a global market place. Such new registration system could give rise to
duplication and fragmentation of data, leading to inefficiencies, errors and confusion for the
consumer, the commercial licensee, rights administrators and right owners.



27
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
28
  On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.


                                                                                                             21
                        Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



Moreover, the Berne Convention prohibits any mandatory formality as a condition for the
protection. A European registry would result as an option that right holders can use, but not as
an obligation. This could expose works to a two-tier system where registered works are
protected and non-registered works are not. Such a development would work against the
interests of smaller enterprises and independent creators, and the cultural context in which
they operate. A registration system would also run the risk of being misinterpreted in the
sense that failure to register would be seen as a waiver of entitlement to protection or revenue.
Such a result would run directly counter to the expressed purpose of this Consultation
identified at page 2 namely: “…to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of
the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural
diversity.”

An EU-centric registration system would create a two-tier (or more) copyright data source.
This will confuse consumers and prospective licensees alike. It is not the legislative or
jurisprudential environment in which copyrights are exercised that needs to be systematically
available, but the chain of title and correct sources of licences on a worldwide basis. Put
another way, it is not the existence of a work that needs a central record, but the mechanisms
by which the works may be lawfully exercised – and this process begins by identifying:

       ‐   the owner of a work
       ‐   the territory of ownership (particularly important where it is split territorially by
           contract) and
       ‐   the place(s) where and methods by which licences for lawful use may be secured.


18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

CMOs have for decades been the repositories of creative works-related information. They also
constantly work to improve data accuracy and streamline conflicts/dispute resolution. In this
respect, CISAC welcomes the CRM Directive as its implementation is a signal of the
Commission’s support for the principle of collective administration and commitment to the
part CMOs have to play on the growth and diversity of the EU market.

Copyright registration is not a requirement of protection under Berne. However, efficient and
accurate data is essential for the recording of the chain of title of copyright works across
territories, for the accurate issuing of licences, administration of rights and the management of
licence revenues. To provide this important function, CISAC operates the Common
Information System (CIS)29 which is a worldwide digital rights management system, based on
standardised identification of creative works and linked data exchange networks between the
CISAC societies. By enabling CISAC’s members to optimise their day-to-day administration
and information exchanges, the CIS facilitates automated transactions and more accurate and
quicker royalty distribution between CISAC societies. CIS enables CISAC’s member
societies to improve their efficiency with respect to both creators and users and to seize the
opportunities that the Internet has introduced.

The CIS consists of two series of tools that provide the building blocks to global digital
copyright administration:

                                                                                               22
                         Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules




           - The first component features the integration of unique, ISO-certified, standardised
           international identifiers of works and parties relevant to the creative process.

           - The second pertains to a network of global databases, or sub-systems relying on
           various centralised and increasingly decentralised technologies, that will serve as the
           repository of authoritative information on the creative process for all participating
           CISAC societies.

The preamble to Section D of the Questionnaire references the Global Repertoire Database
(GRD) initiative for musical works in which CISAC is a key player. The GRD aims to be a
single, comprehensive and authoritative representation of the global ownership and control of
musical works and which has been developed so far with the input of representatives from
along the length of the music licensing value chain30. Such a single authoritative source of
global ownership data will be of enormous benefit to all involved, and result in reduced
transaction costs for right owners and users alike. It would also improve accuracy; facilitate
more streamlined licensing and support swifter dispute resolution. The funding of the GRD
initiative has been undertaken by the authors’ societies; as non-profit organisations, this is a
major investment commitment.

A valuable incentive from the EU in relation to the GRD, in particular, and for other global
industry specific databases for the audio visual, literary and visual sectors, would be financial
as well as political support. This would send a signal of the Commission’s commitment to
collective management. It could usefully be backed up by political initiatives to secure
equivalent economic support from, say, the USA and developing countries. It would also
serve to resolve or prevent any internal friction over respective responsibilities for costs that
may derail or delay the completion of such important global resources for the digital age.



D.         How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The

   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

                                                                                                          23
                          Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?

The EU could play an important role in supporting existing identifiers and actively
promoting their adoption across the board.

The development and implementation of creative content identifiers in all sectors is a main
area of activity - and a key priority - for CISAC and its member societies. Substantial
investments were made by CISAC and its members in the development of ISO standard
identifiers, to support prompt and accurate identification of works and related collection and
distribution of royalties. CISAC therefore welcomes the CRM Directive’s clear endorsement
of existing database initiatives (in particular in Recitals 33 to 35). As the development and
implementation of industry identifiers entails the investment of significant financial resources,
the EU could meaningfully assist in supporting existing identifiers that have been voluntarily
embraced by industry, and promote their implementation by users and intermediaries involved
in creative content distribution.


E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?

                         Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



     YES – Please explain

The term of protection for authors’ works available under EU rules is appropriate and
should be maintained.

The current digital climate and the new possibilities to use creative works only highlight the
need to maintain the existing term of protection for copyright content. The current term of
copyright is also fitting following the recent extension of the sound recording copyright term.
Any consideration or review of the existing protection period must be supported by solid
policy goals. It is unclear to CISAC what the policy considerations might be for a change in
existing terms of protection, which strike an appropriate balance between the interest of
society and the public at large and those of the individual creators, who invest in the
development of their work, for the economic health and cultural diversity of the EU.


II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions

                        Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided
in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     NO – Please explain

The existing EU framework on limitations and exceptions is useful and appropriate, and
provides the needed clarity and certainty for both users and rights holders.

Directive EC 2001/29 EC has a clear and exhaustive list of exceptions and limitations at
Article 5, accessible and readily understandable to both copyright holders and the consumer.
Individual Member States retain their right locally to implement or not individual exceptions
and limitations and this principle of local application is supported (and regulated) by both
domestic case law and CJEU jurisprudence. In addition, the principle of the “3 step test”
enshrined in article 5.5 of Directive 2001/29 clarifies the overall scope of all exceptions. This
framework allows the end-users to “easily figure out which acts fall under the exception and
which uses of copyrighted work are allowed without the authorisation of the author and
which are not” (DeWolf Study, p 535).

To accommodate the fair compensation due to right holders for the limitations to their rights,
collective management provides convenient and market sensitive solutions. The Union has a
network of comprehensive coverage across all Member States for this purpose. Specific
examples of such collective management schemes include the educational recording licensing
schemes operated in the United Kingdom41 and which reward a broad range of right owners
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

for the use of their copyright works in educational establishments. Elsewhere in Europe such
educational licensing schemes operate under the aegis of CMOs with a consolidated remit
across these uses.

We note the pressure from some interested parties to introduce a doctrine into the EU
equivalent to the US “Fair Use” doctrine – wider in application and less certain than the
exhaustive list of exception and limitations presently available via Article 5 of the Information
Society Directive. It is our view that such a move would be disadvantageous for the following
reasons:

      ‐   It would be extremely disruptive to abandon centuries of legal tradition and overturn
          existing CJEU jurisprudence on this subject in order to adopt one that is unfamiliar to
          consumers, users and legal professionals alike.

      ‐   Change would lead to legal uncertainty and an increase in the number of legal
          proceedings, due to the ambiguity concerning the scope of permitted acts.

      ‐   The US fair use doctrine is a codification of some 200 years of judicial rulings on the
          subject. The doctrine relies on this case law backdrop which gives it its meaning and
          scope.

      ‐   The De Wolf report itself does not support the introduction of a US-style “fair use”
          exception42 in terms so unambiguous that they are worth reproducing here in full:
          “At the European level, a complete switch from the current European system of legally
          defined exceptions to an open-ended, fair-use like regime, does not receive much
          support from academics and stakeholders. First, because it makes little sense to
          completely abandon a legal tradition that has existed from hundreds of years, to adopt
          a system that is not familiar at all to European lawyers. Then, because it would imply
          the creation of legal uncertainty at a large scale, which is highly unwelcome. Legal
          uncertainty in the US fair use system is mitigated by more than two hundreds of years
          of binding caselaw which provides thousands of examples of application of the fair use
          criteria in particular cases. The adoption, from scratch, of a similar system in the EU
          would lack this fundamental element and leave practitioners and courts in great
          uncertainty when it comes to predict the application of, and to apply such a norm to
          individual cases. We follow the views expressed by Ian Hargreaves in his 2011 review
          that promoting a Fair Use Copyright exception in the EU is not the best solution,
          because the economic benefits of a more adaptative copyright regime are more likely
          to be attained in practice otherwise and because there are genuine legal doubts about
          the viability of a US case law based legal mechanism in a European context.”


      ‐    Clamour from consumers for an extension to the list of exception and limitations
          could arguably be attributable to ignorance of available solutions, and motivated by
          the free content and pro-piracy movement. Further, big business interests, (many if not
          most of whom are domiciled outside the European Union) have done much to promote
          dissatisfaction with the current legal regime. While they purport to promulgate change

                                                                                               27

       in the interests of free speech and free access to information, one could also argue that
       the motivation is more realistically driven by a commercial motive – to reduce costs to
       their own businesses and increase profits which contribute little to the value of the EU
       creative industries as a whole.


22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a
higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  NO – Please explain

The current closed-list of exceptions and limitations provides legal certainty and has long
been developed and clarified jurisprudentially at both the CJEU and in individual Member
States. It provides sufficient flexibility and collective management supports an effective
framework for fair compensation where this is an option for Member States.

The only aspect that raises concerns between authors is the application of the principle of “fair
remuneration” which accompanies the private copying exception. Current situation in Spain is
markedly out of step with the EU principle of fair compensation for private copying (see
answer to Q 71). In United Kingdom there is concern amongst authors and performers for a
proposal from the government to introduce a private copy exception without any
accompanying fair compensation mechanism. Such reform would clearly breach article 5 of
the Directive EC/2001/29.

23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
………………………………………………………………………………………………
24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree
of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  NO – Please explain why

Further flexibility in this area would lead to more ambiguity and less certainty with respect to
the scope of permitted acts. Moreover, it would undermine the principle that exceptions have
to be limited to specific cases that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and
do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author. This principle is
enshrined in art. 9 Berne Convention and also entered in art 5.5 to Directive 29/2001. The
current closed list of exceptions and limitations provides the necessary certainty, has long
been clarified by the courts, and allows Member States sufficient flexibility in their domestic
implementation of EU rules.

25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by
national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and

26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
     NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to

CISAC believes that the current list of exceptions and limitations is sufficiently clear and
works to promote harmonization in this area, which removes any potential problems with
respect to the scope of permitted acts.

27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have
cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when
such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

As explained above, the current closed list of exceptions and limitations provides legal
certainty, has long been developed and clarified jurisprudentially at both the CJEU and in
individual Member States to provide flexibility and collective management provides an
effective framework for fair compensation where this is an option for Member States. The
CJEU case law on the private copying levy demonstrates how collective licensing can
accommodate fair compensation in cross-border uses in a flexible and simple manner.


A.         Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving43 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions44. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive45.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

               1.     Preservation and archiving

The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.


28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
  YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

               2.     Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.


32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?

               3.     E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.


36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across
borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across

                 4.       Mass digitisation


The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other46. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)47.

40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

47
  France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC48 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation limitations
and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would
typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing copies
of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected content on a
smart board without having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation of
this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation at Member States level. The
implementation of the exception differs from Member State to Member State, with several Member
States providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some
argue that the law should provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?

The existing EU framework on limitations and exceptions is useful and appropriate, and
provides the needed clarity and certainty for both users and rights holders.

Directive EC 2001/29 EC incorporates a clear and exhaustive list of exceptions and
limitations at Article 5, accessible and readily understandable to both copyright holders and
the consumer. Individual Member States retain the ability to introduce individual exceptions
and limitations and this principle of local application is supported (and regulated) by both
domestic case law and CJEU jurisprudence. Moreover CMOs provide the necessary solutions
through dedicated licensing for e.g. teaching, educational institutions, research, etc.


C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC49 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their national laws
a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open formulation of this

D.         Disabilities

Directive 2001/29/EC50 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 51.

The Marrakesh Treaty52 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics53 are different terms used to describe increasingly
important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing
texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or other
automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights,
patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible through
subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is
made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories
or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to
mine protected works or other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the right
holders for the making of such copies unless such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible
to general public without restrictions on the internet, open access).



53
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.


                                                                                                      37
                      Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining
activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in particular since text
and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in several different
ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue
go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use content) and
relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial
databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe"
stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the
problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and data
mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by publishers as an outcome of
“Licences for Europe”54. In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no
additional licences should be required to mine material to which access has been provided through a
subscription agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and data mining should be
introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
     NO – Please explain
Under art. 3 of Directive 96/9/EC, databases which, by reason of the selection or arrangement
of their contents, constitute the author's own intellectual creation shall be protected as such by
copyright. The Directive provides on the one hand a copyright protection for the intellectual
creation involved in the selection and arrangement of materials; on the other a “sui
generis” protection for an investment (financial and in terms of human resources, effort and
energy) in the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents of a database.
With regards to the “sui generis” protection, art. 7.5 of the Directive establishes that “The
repeated and systematic extraction and/or re-utilization of insubstantial parts of the contents
of the database implying acts which conflict with a normal exploitation of that database or
which unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the maker of the database shall not be
permitted”. It does not operate any exception (free use) in this regard.

F.      User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs55. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
55
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound

videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across

61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

CISAC perceives problems in the wide drafting of these questions, as there is no
universally-acknowledged definition of what constitutes UGC. Further, CISAC does not
see any need to create an express exception for UGC. CMOs offer licensing solutions
that cover a range of activities, including some UGC use.

Depending on what is meant by UGC, UGC is an act of adaptation and of copying – both
restricted acts under international treaties and the copyright legislation of individual Member
States. Whether right holder consent is required for UGC should be viewed in light of the
following key considerations: (i) the existence of an independent economic existence and (ii)
the extent of modification of the original work. The former can be addressed via collective
licensing, the latter via negotiations between individual right owners and platforms or creators
of UGC that have independent commercial purpose or effect. A single consumer creating a
UGC derived from the work of an author who is remunerated for other uses of that work may
not see their treatment as commercial. Yet it is perfectly conceivable that the use may have an
economic impact on that original author’s interests.

The flourishing UGC sector demonstrates that the potential liability for infringement has not
had a chilling effect on the development of these services. This is also supported by the
inability of the De Wolf study to identify any evidence of this57. Undoubtedly those platforms
that offer a forum for UGC content (such as Youtube or Dailymotion) will argue
disingenuously for such an exception to be created and such arguments will likely be based
upon the non-commercial, social and informal nature of public engagement with pre-existing
works to produce UGC content. But it cannot be denied that those same platforms are large,
profitable commercial operations. They should be, and are, licensed so owners of the
underlying works are duly compensated.

CISAC agrees with the reasoning of professor Ficsor, which is also mentioned by the DeWolf
Study, stating that “the mere reason that a derivative work is created and made available and
that therefore it should be free in order to guarantee the freedom of expression is hardly an
acceptable reason alone since Article 12 and 14(1) of the Berne Convention provide for an
exclusive right of adaptation which “by definition” covers the creation of derivative works”.

Finally, it should be noted that CMOs already issue flexible licences to such enterprises and
individual rights owners are constantly engaged in discussions to make this process simpler
and more streamlined.

III. Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying58. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5960.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the
private copying and reprography exceptions61 in the digital environment?

     NO – Please explain

There is no need for a new legal framework in the copyright regime to address this. The
regime of private copying levies to afford fair compensation to creators is a valuable and
unobtrusive plank of the EU copyright regime. It has been sufficiently clarified in a
series of judicial decisions.

The subject has had detailed and varied attention in EU jurisprudence and its application is a
low impact (from the point of the view of the individual consumer) enabling enjoyment of
music, literary and audio visual works across a variety of platforms and devices (where such
interoperability has not been inconveniently prevented by different hardware manufacturers or
service providers). EU case law has designated the manufacturers, distributors and importers
as those responsible for the levy. However, unwillingness to comply with the law on the part
of manufacturers and importers has been the major difficulty – many of which are domiciled
outside the Union, as is illustrated by the chain of CJEU jurisprudence. But the effect has,
fortunately, been useful to afford the CJEU an opportunity to define the limits and certain
conditions in the application of the levy. For example:

In Padawan in 201062 the courts made clear that the Directive’s terms applied equally to
copying services as to devices. The CJEU identified clear guidelines such as that the fair
compensation should achieve a balance between the person making the copies and thus liable
to pay it and the right owner. The levy can be imposed indirectly by, for example, being
incorporated into the price of the device and passed to the consumer. It is not necessary to
demonstrate that each private person has actually made copies. The CJEU also held that it is
incompatible with the Directive to charge a levy where the device is not made available to
private users and clearly reserved for uses other than private copying.

In the 2011 cross-border case of Thuiskopie 63 the court reinforced the cultural importance (to
creators and copyright owners) of the levy system, restated the convenience of the
manufacturer or importer being able to pay and pass the cost to their customers and that the
levy should be paid in the territory in which the private users making the copies reside.

In the 2013 VG Wort case64 the CJEU held that the right of fair compensation attaches to
direct, indirect, temporary and permanent copying and even where it is possible as a matter of
technology to apply measures to prevent copying, this does not obviate the need for fair
compensation. The wording of the Directive covers both the medium and the means of
copying, there is no digital exclusion; the wording is meant to address the result of the private
person’s activity. As this cannot be individually policed it is right that the payment is passed
to the consumer – all clearly set out in paragraphs 75 to 77 of the judgement:

75       That said, as ‘fair compensation’ is a concept which has its own independent meaning
         in European Union law, the Court has made clear, as pointed out in paragraph 31
         above, that the purpose of that compensation is to compensate authors for the
         reproduction, without their authorisation, of their protected works, so that it must be

      regarded as recompense for the harm suffered by authors as a result of that
      reproduction. Accordingly, it is, in principle, for the person who has caused the harm,
      namely the person who makes a copy of the protected work without seeking prior
      authorisation from the rightholder, to make good the harm suffered by financing the
      compensation which will be paid to the rightholder (see, to that effect, Padawan,
      paragraphs 44 and 45).

76     The Court has however accepted that, given the practical difficulties connected with
      such a system of fair compensation, it is open to the Member States to go back to the
      stages before the actual copying and put in place a ‘private copying levy’, for the
      purposes of financing fair compensation, chargeable to persons who are in possession
      of the reproduction equipment, devices and mediums and, on that basis, in law or in
      fact, make those items available to persons making copies or provide copying services
      for them, since such a system enables the persons liable to pay compensation to pass on
      the cost of the levy to private users, and the latter therefore assume the burden of the
      private copying levy (see, to that effect, Padawan, paragraphs 46 and 49, and Stichting
      de Thuiskopie, paragraphs 27 and 28).

77     Applying that case-law mutatis mutandis to the reproduction on paper or similar
      medium exception, it is, in principle, for the person who has made such a reproduction
      to finance the compensation which will be paid to the rightholders. However, Member
      States are free, given the practical difficulties encountered, to put in place, where
      appropriate, a levy chargeable to the persons in possession of the equipment on which
      the reproduction has been made.

It also held that where a Member State has decided to introduce in its national law the private
copying exception, the authorization granted by the right holders to allow the making of
private copies is devoid of any legal effect.

In this VG Wort decision, the CJEU finally clearly stated that insofar as a contractual
authorization to allow the making of private copies has no legal object, it cannot have any
bearing on the fair compensation which constitutes its recompense.

A month later, in the Amazon case65 the CJEU made provision for a system of reimbursement
where there was the risk of double payment between Member States, which system was to be
operated in a manner to be determined by the local courts. In addition, allocation of the
benefit of part of the levy for the purpose of supporting domestic social and cultural initiatives
was held not to fall out with the distribution of revenues provided that the benefit is allocated
in a non-discriminatory manner and access to such a fund is open to citizens from other
Member States and such use was not to be taken to mean that an author was presumed to have
waived its entitlement to such recompense.

In the United Kingdom there is concern amongst authors and performers where the UK
Government proposed a private copy exception without any accompanying fair compensation
mechanism – in clear breach of Article 5 EC/2001/29. This should be a concern at EU level
and not just a matter for lobbying on a domestic basis.

                      Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



CISAC also expresses concern for the situation in Spain, where a breach to the regime of
private copying levy as established by the EU law and jurisprudence has recently taken place.
In 2011 the Spanish Government eliminated the levy system and transferred to the state
budget the fair remuneration obligation reducing dramatically the compensation for authors.
At present the levels of compensation for rightholders fail to meet the concept of “fair”
compensation as contemplated in art. 5.2.b) EC/2001/29 (see answer to question 71).

65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service
that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal,
be subject to private copying levies?66
     YES – Please explain

CISAC asks first what is meant by “minimal harm”. This phrasing is ambiguous and
dangerous, and any statistical analysis of the answers to this question (if such analysis is
intended) could present a damaging response profile. Is this phrase intended to cover damage
to individual authors? Damage to the market for individual works? or perhaps damage to the
market as a whole across all the creative industries? Where does the requirement for
“minimal” sit?

Vitorino’s recommendation that “copies that are made by end users for private purposes in
the context of a service that has been licensed by right holders do not cause any harm that
would require additional remuneration in the form of private copying levies” obviously
inspired this question, and raises serious concern. Mr Vitorino basically suggested eliminating
private copying levies, notably for so called “new business models in the digital environment.
CISAC believes that this recommendation is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the
private copying system. Private copies cannot be licensed if they are covered by a statutory
exception to copyright under the 2001/29 Copyright Directive. Therefore, licensing and fair
compensation for private copying are necessarily separate issues and can only be addressed as
such. This principle has also been confirmed by the CJEU in the VG Wort decision (C-457/11
to 460/11), where it was held that where a Member State has decided to introduce in its
national law the private copying exception, the authorization granted by the right holders to
allow the making of private copies is devoid of any legal effect.

In that respect, it is also highly relevant that the CJEU considered in yet another case,
Luksan/Petrus van der Let (ECJ, 9 February 2012, Case C-277/10, that “in the Member States
which have decided to establish the private copying exception, the rightholders concerned
must, in return, receive payment of fair compensation and that it is clear from such wording
that the European Union legislature did not wish to allow the persons concerned to be able to
waive payment of that compensation to them”.

Removing the private copy levy would harm especially consumers and rightholders: the
consumers would lose their freedom to realise copies and the authors will be denied their fair
compensation. Furthermore, it would involve the re-introduction of technological protection
measures which consumers have massively rejected in the past.



66
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies


                                                                                                          45
                      Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



It must also be recalled that the private copying system guarantees to right holders
participation in the benefits for the use of their work. Private copying remuneration operates
in the virtuous economy of copyright which generates income distributed directly to authors.
This remuneration helps authors to achieve financial independence, stimulating their
creativity and artistic freedom whilst allowing them to focus entirely on their art. Moreover,
private copying system corrects inequalities between right holders and guarantees that each
category of right holders benefits from a fair share of the value.

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

The private copying remuneration schemes are fully compatible with the development of
new business models, products and services related to digital content. The emergence of
new business models, as well as of the consumer devices, has exponentially grown over
the past years, without being affected by private copying remuneration schemes.

Cloud services are various and they are not homogeneous. It is therefore necessary to analyse
these services on a case-by-case basis before determining the legal regime applicable to them.

Furthermore, as new services emerge daily in the digital environment, labelling them as being
subject to private copying levies or not, just because of the technology they use, would be
restrictive and inaccurate. These offers need to be assessed carefully according to the
function and the service they deliver in each case (e.g. cloud-based download services are
different than pure streaming services, or a dumb cyber-locker service would be subject to
levy if its functionality is limited to storage of private copies). Moreover, as a principle,
whether a service involves private copying possibilities subject to fair compensation is a
consideration to be made at the time of determining the amount of levies on a certain device
and not likely to impact the emergence or development of that new service itself.

Member States where private copying compensation is provided should extend the scope of
levies to the services that allow individual consumers to copy their copyright content for
private purposes on their devices. In this respect, the CJEU in its Padawan ruling several
times mentions that private copying could be made not only by “digital reproduction
equipment, devices and media but also by copying services”. Depriving authors and
composers from this income would seriously harm their earnings and would take away one of
their well-established direct revenue streams on the basis of ill-founded assumptions.

 67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?67
     NO

CISAC does not believe this technical issue requires intervention.


67
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.


                                                                                                          46
                   Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



Other options may be taken into account to make the levies transparent such as an official
publication of tariffs. From a consumer perspective, this may give clarity and build trust in
the level of levies imposed and contribute to the process of consumer education on copyright
and neighbouring rights. In particular, an official publication of tariffs could be helpful to
provide consumers with information about the amount and the destination of the levies as well
as to raise awareness on the reasons for this mechanism that allow users to realise copies of
protected works.

71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system,
how would these problems best be solved?

CISAC’s answers to the preceding questions largely cover the issues raised here, save in two
Member States only averred to above. The current situations in Spain and the United
Kingdom are markedly out of step with the EU principle of fair compensation for private
copying.




                                                                                            47
                          Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



In the United Kingdom, as mentioned above, a private copying exception was proposed
without the accompanying compensation element – in direct contravention of the United
Kingdom’s obligations under Article 5 of EC/2001/29 EC.

In Spain, the abolition in 2011 of the levy system and the subsequent proposal to charge the
levy against the State budget (as opposed to those instruments facilitating the copies) appears
to CISAC not to reflect Spain’s obligations under the Directive nor the actual marketplace in
this Member State. As a consequence of the change, the levels of compensation for
rightholders have decreased dramatically, and clearly fail to meet the concept of “fair”
compensation.



IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors a number of exclusive rights. There are few
provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from authors or
performers to producers68 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or
other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract69. This is an area that
has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant differences
in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different sectors of the
creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?

Collective administration is already providing efficient solutions to online licensing of
creative works. This enables a re-balancing of the unequal negotiating positions as
between author and user. The tradition of collective management (along with the trade
associations for creators established throughout the Union) also gives authors access to
know-how that would normally be beyond an individual author.

     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                       Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules




While traditional support for creators also comes from other entities such as managers, agents,
or large right-owning companies, recent horizontal integration of major rights owners, as well
as patterns of self-employment, have diluted the effectiveness of such support for individual
authors who entrust their rights to large corporations. CMOs, and the Creators’ Councils
operating within CISAC, continue to promote the interests of creators and constantly work to
ensure they obtain fair remuneration for their work.

For a detailed discussion on sector-specific aspects, CISAC would refer the Consultation to
the submissions of GESAC (music), SAA (audio-visual) and EVA (visual art).

V. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE70 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text71. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose72. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure73. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

on the volume of traffic.

  This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

Respect for rights and the availability of effective enforcement measures is vital for the
functioning and continued growth of the digital market.

CISAC is concerned that the question posed should exclude the application of the E-
Commerce Directive, as this directive is so often used by some Internet intermediaries
disingenuously to shelter under by virtue of so-called “safe harbours”. The Commission’s
reluctance to open the E-Commerce directive jeopardizes any attempt to improve
enforcement.

CISAC is also concerned at the undefined use of the word “commercial purpose”. This term is
ambiguous and it is difficult to see how, in the online environment, the purpose of an
infringing service could be established. Indeed, many of the bad actors in the online
environment may not be operating for commercial benefit, yet inflict harm which is similar or
even greater from that resulting from services which operate for profit making purposes.


76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
See text above
77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection
of private life and protection of personal data?

Without the cooperation of Internet Service Providers, it is extremely difficult for right
holders to identify the individuals responsible for the infringements to their rights.

The European Court of Justice has ruled74 that it is for each Member State to decide whether
to enact laws allowing or requiring the disclosure of personal data for civil enforcement
purposes. However, the Court concluded that, when transposing the directives involved in this
issue, each Member State would need to strike a fair balance between the right to protection
of property and the right to data protection, which are both recognised as fundamental rights
by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Further, national laws would
respect the other general principles of European Law, including the principle of
proportionality.



VI. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an

                                                                                                50

objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU,
as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  NO
79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

The existing EU copyright rules establish a useful and effective framework and there is
no need for further harmonization through a single EU title.

The Information Society Directive already gives sufficient guidance as to copyright’s
regulation and operation within the digital environment. A unitary copyright title would not
ameliorate the challenges in multi-territory licensing – challenges that, in any event, are being
met by EU CMOs. Nor would it necessarily address the concerns of authors as outlined
above. It is fair, non-discriminatory and convenient licensing that is of most benefit to all
stakeholders and collective administration remains a proven and effective method that brings
this about.

CISAC sees any attempt to reform the whole copyright aquis as an issue that should be
approached with great care and merits careful consideration. If the Commission were to
embark upon a wholesale review, CISAC would be an active participant, especially as it is in
a unique position to harness the views of creators globally as well as within the EU.



VII. Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright?
Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.

CISAC believes that the Information Society Directive affords sufficient flexibility to
accompany the technological evolutions related to the online exploitation of protected
works and has proven that it was an appropriate framework enabling to address many
of the issues raised by such online exploitation.


                                                                                               51
                   Public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright rules



We have therefore answered the Consultation only as necessary. However, should the
Commission decide to reopen the Directive, it is important that it takes into account the real
issues and, in particular, the remuneration of creators in the digital world – an issue which
was mentioned in a number of our replies above.

CISAC has grave concerns with respect to the distribution of the benefits of the digital value
chain. Creators, whose works lie at the heart of each and every streaming, downloading or
other digital service, are not fairly remunerated and do not obtain a fair share from the
economic benefits derived from the online exploitation of their content. There is an urgent
need to address the unequal manner in which online services share revenues with creators and
widen the debate regarding this fundamental problem which impacts on the EU digital
market, EU citizens and EU culture.

The EU creative industries are comprised of (with some notable exceptions) individual
creators and SMEs working alongside the large constituency of entities who deliver the
services that support the industry infrastructure. It is these parties that are the major
contributors to member States’ tax revenues. It is the interests of these constituencies that
should be driving policy to promote growth and diversity in the EU’s cultural sector.

We would refer, here again, the Consultation to the discussion and positions taken by the
European organisations representing CMOs by repertoire – GESAC (music), SAA
(audiovisual) and EVA (visual art).
