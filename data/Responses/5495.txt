Copyright extension to 3D printing

Designing a new product can be very time consuming and expensive.

I don’t know if the technology already exists, but at some time in the
future it will be possible to photograph a complex shaped product from
different angles and weave the images together to produce a 3D image. It
will then be possible to generate a set of instructions for 3D printing of
a facsimile.

These instructions can then be sold or given away via the internet.

Specific example
We have won UK Technology Strategy Board funding to help us build a
prototype Latent Power Turbine. For details visit
www.cheshire-innovation.com/Sky%20Tube.htm

The unique shape of the turbine blades will form an important part of our
IP portfolio.
With the exception of the blades, all of the other components are “off the
shelf” items, so selling sets of blades or 3D printer instructions may be
our principle route to profit.

The protection we are seeking
The new copyright laws should anticipate shape copying developments and
ensure that in addition to the shape of an object being covered by
copyright law, any 3D printer instructions allowing the shape to be
reproduced should also be covered.

Essentially the copyright owner for any 3D printer instructions should, by
default, be the owner of the original design rights.

If this protection is not offered, an unethical business could generate a
set of instructions for copying our laboriously designed turbine blades and
then sell them on to many thousands of third parties.

Seeking compensation from a large population of third parties for breaching
our original design rights would be financially impossible.

If this extension of IP rights is not explicitly covered by the regulations
then the theft of technical deigns will become legitimised and commonplace.

Yours sincerely,

Bill Courtney
