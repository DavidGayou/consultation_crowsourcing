PUBLIC CONSULTATION
ON THE REVIEW OF THE EU COPYRIGHT RULES


In 1764, Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria-Bonesana an unknown Italian jurist,
philosopher and politician, wrote a single treatise the world still uses to
guide criminal justice.
Long before Beccaria wrote his treatise, the Magna Carta was written. ing
June 15, 1215, in a field at Runnymede, 40 rebellious barons demanded King
John affix his seal to a document, the Magna Carta, also called The Great
Charter of the Liberties of England, the Magna Carta Libertatum. Two
principles expressed in Magna Carta resonate to this day, in America, like
many other great ideas aka Content, America has ‘borrowed’ from the EU-
coinless parking metering, bikeshare, countless parodies of the Beatles,
“The Office”, “Robin’s Nest” and countless other remakes of UK shows.
Robin’s Nest? C’mon. Three’s Company starring the late John Ritter. “The
Office”? Called “The Office”, not much of a stretch needed there.
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_television_series_based_on_Br
itish_television_series ]
The two principles expressed in Magna Carta that inspired Americans
fighting the American Revolution, are, "No freeman shall be taken,
imprisoned, disseised, outlawed, banished, or in any way destroyed, nor
will We proceed against or prosecute him, except by the lawful judgment of
his peers or by the law of the land," and "To no one will We sell, to no
one will We deny or delay, right or justice." These Rights are guaranteed
in the Magna Carta in the Laws of the Revolutionists states, then into the
US Constitution and the Bill of Rights.” The Fifth Amendment descends from
the Magna Carta’s guarantee of proceedings according to the “law of the
land.” The Fifth Amendment states, “no person shall . . . be deprived of
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."

ip.html ]
Cesare Beccaria’s "On Crimes and Punishments" impacted the US Constitution,
Bill of Rights and Judicial system in influencing the foundation of
criminology which were built and expanded from Beccaria’s theories on
arrest, prosecution and punishment.

In the treatise, Beccaria addressed preventing crime in his treatise "On
Crimes and Punishments." Beccaria believed preventing crime was better than
punishing criminals for their crimes. Beccaria’s Nine Principles a Society
needs to effectively prevent crime are:
1) the laws must be clear and simple
2) the entire nation must be united in defense
3) the laws are against men, and women, not classes of men and women
4) the laws must be feared by the men and women in society, nothing less
5) the men and women, society, need to know for sure what the outcome of
crime is IF they decide to risk breaking a law
6) the men and women need to know what the law in that knowing is part of
the enlightenment of liberty
7) virtue has to be rewarded
8) the people need to be educated
9) the magistracy as a whole must observe and not corrupt the laws

How the hell could a Well Laid plan go so wrong in the IOE, the Internet of
Everything age, where centuries old legal concepts are being torn apart by
Legislators who don’t take time to educate the public of their ancestry
that got them to here with rights that began in humble beginnings,
actually, even earlier than Forty Barons and a King in a  muddy field off
Runnymede. Seven hundred and ninety nine years, in the least, being tossed
down the toilet because of something called the Internet of Things, that
sounds great in forward looking SEC Filings but, in the real world of
people trying to make a living doing what they love, isnt really turning
out so great, is it.

Beccaria’s treatise concerned the criminal justice system. The criminal
justice system is beginning to concern Legislators on Capitol Hill in
America. One such Congressman, a Republican, is beginning to awaken to the
IOT, Internet of Everything, being an IOEC, Internet of Every Crime-
Intellectual Property Theft, Identity Theft, Human Trafficking, Money
Laundering, the list goes on and on, AS does the list of goods the private
companies have on every citizen of the world with an online presence.
“They” know who you are, where you are, what you said to whom, when and,
don’t be amazed, if one day the IOT shuts down with the global IOEC and
disappear. Unlikely? Think SOPA [ www.sopastrike.com  ]

In a way, Beccaria was a Snowden before his time. Because Beccaria feared
political backlash, he anonymously wrote, his 1764 treatise "On Crimes and
Punishments," so it was to the point and clearly understood, a lesson the
EU Commission should take heed of in that the solicitation of this

Public Consultation was NOT written in words understood by the Public the
EU Commission seeks review from.  "On Crimes and Punishments," was
reprinted in many languages around the globe, influencing creation and
reform of penal systems.

Beccaria crafted his treatise like a three legged stool. All legs are
needed so the stool doesn’t fall over. Points in this treatise include:
     1) all individuals have freewill and make choices with freewill
     2) all individuals rationally look out for their own personal
        satisfaction, which must be grasped to understand the relationship
        between laws and crime ie. see a cop on the beat? A criminal may
        decide to not commit the crime individuals rationally look out for
        their own interest which may include deviant acts and breaking the
        law, the goal being to stop deviant acts and laws being broken
     3) People are predictable and controllable even when pursuing self
        interest

So the job of the Criminal Justice System, knowing people are predictable
is to facilitate the Person’s rational thought in pursuing personal
pleasure and facilitate their deciding that Deviant Acts and Breaking the
Law is not a decision in their best interest. Global legislators role is to
define the right threatening punishment, for each committable Internet Age
crime, that will make Internet Users think twice  if they don’t want to do
the “Time” or pay the “Dime.”

But people are people. And people take risks convincing themselves THEY are
the one who wont get caught. In an Internet age, as Law Enforcement has
never experienced before, unless Global Legislators get their proverbial
acts together, catching a thief, nears becoming impossible in the Internet
world of Aliases, Snapchats (disappearing conversations), Bitcoins
(cryptocurrency that does not exist), Avatars (every one can “be” David
Beckham or Posh by taking their ID, Identity photo and Right of Publicity
that team owners and agents explain away citing it builds a Fan Base- tweet
that, Kim Kardashian, or whoever on Team Kim K Brand, is paid to do a
million things a normal human person could not accomplish in a month let
alone an hour).

Team EU Commission must make the Punishment greater than the pleasure the
person thinks they will get from doing the dastardly or committing the
crime, ie in the IOT, Internet of Everything, 2D ARTS Creators IP,
Intellectual Property, ID, Identity, Content and Commerce. Team EU
Commission, Team Parliament,

Team Congress and all Legislators signed on to the Berne Convention must
get on the same page. There are no borders in the Internet of Everything.
An online
programmer in Belarus is being sought for gumming up a billion dollar
healthcare system.
                                                                     [
http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/4/us-intel-warns-belarus-hand-
obamacare/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS ] Such is the way of
Telecommuting in the IOT age, the Internet of Everything, where “bosses”
may never met “employees” or “work for hires” and where a lonely unhappily
married man in Connecticut can pretend to be a staff lawyer working for
Senator Blumenthal using an Avatar through a dating site that was never
vetted for authenticity. Tribute photos of Heroes fallen in current
conflicts are discovered on dating websites. An

Due diligence is fallen to the wayside. Security, Crime and Punishment are
the FIRST conversation the Review of the EU Copyright Rules should have
addressed. Beccaria wrote, “"when the number of those who can understand
the sacred code of laws and hold it in their hands increases, the frequency
of crimes will be found to decrease, for undoubtedly ignorance and
uncertainly of punishments add much to the eloquence of the passions" ( pg.
17)

The “Where to start” to address online Copyright Enforcement, Identity
Theft, Human Trafficking, online Alias’, money-laundering is to revisit,
the Berne Convention. [http://www.centerforcopyrightintegrity.com/the-berne-
convention--where-america-joined-late.html ] Let’s get real. With ALL the
laws on the books with more laws being made daily because some Legislator
somewhere thinks they have an even better idea than the idea that didn’t
work before, the last thing the world of Intellectual Property needs is YET
another new law. WHAT the world of Intellectual Property needs are the
admission that laws really are One Cite Fits All- steal, it’s a crime!
Pretend to be someone else, it’s a crime! Lie, to get money from people,
it’s a crime. The menu of punishment may change but here is the example of
a colleague of mine from London, who focused on getting Mounted Officers
from around the UK on to the same “Command page” so, if and when, officers
were imported to regions of the UK to assist with upcoming protests or the
like, the officers all knew that, for example, “Red Fish” meant woman with
red hair in fishnet stockings, and “Blue Fish” meant, well, wink, the man
ogling her (with no hope. There is a little bit of Benny Hill in everyone
even in a treatise such as this.) The need for uniform command across the
UK was to get the job done, effectively. The EU Commission must get this
Internet Oversight Job done correctly.

As for Alan Hiscox, the officer I refer to? I heard he retired. Lectured
and taught around the world. If I had one man to bring on board for
oversite here, I would hope he is still alive and make him an offer he
cannot refuse…. Financially, I do mean, because what the EU put out in this
review flies in the reality when Legislators know that “too many cooks
spoil the broth.” Everyone has an opinion. The Legislative world needs
fewer opinions, rather, more people holding global constituents in
adherence to the Laws.

Adressing this matter region by region makes no sense when an image put
online in Washington DC is within seconds grabbed by web bots then raped of
its metadata being converted into an Orphan Work which Legislators, global,
have bought in to the notion, these images have no mommies or daddies
                               [
http://www.centerforcopyrightintegrity.com/copyright-law-talks.html ]. They
do. EVERY image in an Internet of Everything world has metadata. That is
the way the Cameras and Image cards are crafted. The notion that a
contemporary image is an Orphan Work, is frankly, the dumbest thing a
legislator can believe. There is a bridge in the middle of Arizona for
sale, too.

Adressing images of people found in vintage shops or at flea markets, well,
they belong to someone too- ancestors, and the like, and should not be put
up for sale without permission of the family. Without that permission, the
only choices should be- next or DYI, do it yourself?

Museums are beginning to feel the pinch of items in their collections. IT
belongs to someone, case in point the Denver and Seattle museums Super Bowl
bet of artifacts. The  Canadian tribe whose Ancestry was on the line, shut
that scrimmage down. The Nuxalk Nation denied their 135 year old relic
being used in this demeaning bet. It is possible to teach the Etiquette of
the Internet World, that just because someone has an idea does not mean it
is a good one waiting to happen. Next to fall, bet’s on a couple of
Sacrophegus that will find their ways back homeland. [

Where to start addressing this issue? Not piece meal. Security First. And
with the advice I gave a young lady who approached me while I was
volunteering on a campaign, asking how would the Candidate handle a hate
crime against a lesbian. You know. I didn’t know. BUT I knew the
Candidate’s regard for Law and Injustice. The only answer was to state (a)
I didn’t know and (b) knowing he was an investigative journalist too that
he would stick to the law on the books that has worked well for centuries
in that a Hate Crime is a Hate Crime whether you are

Pink, Blue, Plaid, Short, Tall, Gay, Straight, Muslim or Jew. He would look
to that law as his standard. Otherwise with each parsing of the law, soon
the only thing left is a mess of crumbs that make more confusion and no
sense. She said, good answer.

Good answer? No, the only answer. TITLE XVII in America addresses Copyright
Protection. TITLE XVIII in America addresses Criminal Code. Beccaria said
KISS, keep it simple (stupid.) Steal. Crime. End of story. Otherwise Law
Enforcement is spinning out of Control while online thieves are tearing
down the Internet Highway.

Online crimes going on in the European Union and America are going on in
the countries of all the signators of the Berne Convention. I learned along
time ago, the more things change, the more they stay the same. There are
two decker tour buses in DC, in NYC, in London, in Paris and I think even
in Ireland, too.  Point being, in each of these countries, cities, and
continents, there are laws on the books addressing Crime and Punishment and
Law Enforcement oversite  ie. the USPS for mail fraud, the US Attornies
office, RICO for wire fraud, and so on and so on. Use them, even tailor
them. MOST important is to Authenticate the Regulations and Legislations
that work or don’t work and don’t use Think Tanks. Or Lobbyists. Do what I
did at UCLA PD, when I trained there actively building the first Crime
Analysis lab of its kind on a college campus on the continent. Determine a
sample population of time ie Three weeks in January, three weeks in March
and three weeks in December, using those time frames to determine “piles”,
data that will stack to show trends. Then use those trends to “quarterback”
the next moves. The data will speak. Just like “algorithms” tell Mobile
Marketers what you want for breakfast in three weeks. Ummm no. Beccaria
said humans have free will.

Moving past Security which is at the core of moving the Internet forward
without collapsing economies and cultures are specifics to questions asked
on the Public Consultation on the review of the EU Copyright Rules.

STATEMENT OF FACT:
The world has changed.
The world moves fast. Criminals move faster.
Great forward thinking statements always have a seedy underbelly.
And there is a sucker born every day. The word “Facebook” sending shivers
up anyone’s leg?

Legislators jumped on board the proposals of the Googles and the Facebooks
so fast, ditching histories and archives of data, many wish they had back.
Paperless society sounded great. Reality is it may be that as many trees
are cut down today as were before the IOE, Internet of Everything. What is
missing are documents. In the IOE, everything can be changed, even people’s
histories. As is, a young lady at a hackathon opened my eyes. She was
applying for a Foreign Service placement. She described that most people
know her by her “Alias.” She explained, let me share, she was correct….

Google definition of ALIAS:
1. used to indicate that a named person is also known or more familiar
under another specified name.
1. a false or assumed identity. - Computing- an alternative name or label
that refers to a file, command, address, or other item, and can be used to
locate or access it. -Telecommunications- each of a set of signal
frequencies that, when sampled at a given uniform rate, would give the same
set of sampled values, and thus might be incorrectly substituted for one
another when reconstructing the original signal. Verb-  Physics
Telecommunications verb: alias; 3rd person present: aliases; past tense:
aliased; past participle: aliased; gerund or present participle: aliasing

                                1. misidentify (a signal frequency),
introducing distortion or error.
There is absolutely no mention in this Rules review stating that
identifying the problem for enforcement of Copyright Complaints that an
online name is an ALIAS and an Avatar can be anyone or, as in the case of
the Bitcoin “developer” Satoshi Nakamoto (中本哲史, Nakamoto Satoshi), the
pseudonymous person or group that designed and created the Bitcoin protocol
and reference software, that no one can say they know anyone who met
Nakamoto                                                  [
http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto-the-creator-of-
bitcoin ] Host sites and Search Engines don’t demand disclosure of Users
real identities, and even if they did, there is not a Copy machine these
days that cannot make a duplicate of a passport or a drivers license or a
photo ID which are already being reported sold on the Internet of
Everything and “Dread Pirate Roberts” Silk Road  was back in  business
within few weeks after being shut down. “Dread Pirate Roberts” is an alias
in case Legislators did not catch the subtlety

The Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright Rules seeks to
harm the good people, asking what can be done in a “perfect”, I think the
overused word is “Harmonious” world.

The questions that should have been asked
“how many Content Creators have had their Intellectual Property stolen?”,
 “how many Content Creators know the value of their stolen IP?”
“Are the Content creators people who make their livelihoods of the ARTS and
Content Creation?”
“Are the Content Creators people who have Day Jobs and do their Content
Creation for the jolly of it?”
“How was the Content Creator paid- flat fee? Royalty?”
“How much money did the Content Creator make from their Content before the
Internet came along?”
“Has the Content Creator seen a drop in their earnings as the Internet as
matured?”
“Have they had their ID stolen?”
“Do they know someone who has had their ID stolen?”
“Have the Content Creator or Person discovered their Identity and or
Content online?”
“Does John or Jane Doe Consumer have a Restraining Order against anyone who
tracked them down due to Private Information online ie. home adress etc?”
“Has the Consumer tried to engage a solicitor to adress IP, ID, Content and
Commerce theft online?”
“If so, what was their experience?”
“Was it offered on Commission?”
“Was there a fee charged?”
“Did the matter settle?”
“ Was there a remedy?”
“How was the process?”
“What was the outcome?”
“What was the time taken to get the matter to a point resolution?”
“Did you go to Small Claims Court?” [
http://www.centerforcopyrightintegrity.com/copyright-law-talks.html ]
“Would you go through the process again?”
“If not, why not?”
 “Will you continue to use the Internet?”
“Would you consider reducing your online presence?”
“Are you spammed?”
“How bad is the Spam?” And….

 “Do you know anyone who got the Million dollar payout from some king in
Nigeria, or, more likely, do you know people who got taken in?”
“Do you believe it is possible to reduce online presence at this juncture?”

“When is the last time you read a tweet from your local, region and
national Legislator?” AND….
“Do you care if they tweet or would prefer they focus on what is being
talked about rather then telling you in 144 characters what they are doing
with whom and when?”

And so on and so on and so on……

The Review responses might be more interesting if these Q & A’s had been
asked. Look, beyond issues of Border crossing and immigrants, there is now
the added pressure of Border Gateway protocol needing to be in place, and
quite frankly, before the investment of instituting it is paid off, it is
most likely redundant in that the Thieves move faster.

Breaking it down further, the Q seeking A’s, the EU is a Union, it is  a
patchwork quilt of Member States, each with its own culture, demography and
uniqueness. They may all have two decker Tourist buses but that does not
mean each Member State wants its own law. Sorry to raise a sore point but
“Euro” anyone? How can a blanket single law work in Union the Euro failed
in and in a culture pushing Cryptocurrency? Develop that Handbook referred
to, keep simple in plain “English”, giving each country the room for
cultural latitude and define the cite of resolution. In an internet world,
that will be complicated unless the first online court is in the planning.
Check with Judge Judy on that one                                  [
www.judgejudy.com ]

This is probably a good opportunity to revisit Cesare Baccaria’s what is
human nature in the world of “Crime and Punishment.”

If after all these generations the Orange and the Loyalist are still at
odds, getting the EU on the same Copyright page is like wrangling kittens-
a whole lot of squalling with no hope of 100% success. Reiterating that the
good people always end up losing and the bad people get away with it, in
this case, stealing of User Generated Content and text and data mining. And
what happens when Copyright Tourism is in question, as in the matter of the
South Korean Company suing a guy in Australia for copyright infringement in
California                                                     [

Where to argue the matter is an issue? Many Internet companies state they
want Arbitrations held in their home state, limit terms, limit Rights To
Free speech, and EU Commission is allowing it. Moreso, there TOS, Terms of
Service can and are changed often without the client realizing. The entity
stating that it is the Users obligation to read the constantly changing
rules is a sham. IF the Entity knows where the USER is to send the USER
notice they ‘may want to invite their friend(s) on to the Service’ or even,
without notice to the User send out solicitations to people they correspond
with, or better yet, share User’s data with Algorithm entities sending ads
for Hotels long after the vacation time came and went, then there is an
obligation of the EU Commission to make these entities send their
subscribers updates in Terms of Service change, and where things like
SETTINGS have an asterisk pop up? Have an important notice alert, too,
which the User has to click to indicate received and read.

A huge issue in adjudicating Copyright issues in courts of law is that
Judges and lawyers look for precedence for guidance. A majorly bad case on
the law that is deferred to in multiple jurisdiction is Microsoft v Perfect
10, a perfect case about IP Theft that was argued poorly trying to squeeze
a square peg in a round hole when the TOS, Terms of Service, held answers
for attorneys to consider- the double standard the Search Engines and ISPs
include in their Policies warning Users the cost of stealing their IP.

The most aggregious of sites stealing and bundling American ID and IP are
sites like Spokeo, Yatedo, Yumpu, 123people.com  amongst others. These
sites homed in Germany, France and elsewhere do the same IP and ID theft in
countries around the world, signator to the Berne Convention. England has
the distinction of being the Algorithm capitol, it seems, then sending its
data crunching out to its minion sites everywhere, all in the push for more
mobile and data. It is important to make this point in that while people
are squawking about the NSA and Snowden, most data is given away from Users
themselves.

Protections sure. Warn people as they enter a page with a pop up or bubble
that (a) by landing on the page they are most likely already cookie’d and
(b) going further there is no 100% data protection so Caveat Empor.

And in an infringement is found, sending something to Google is offensive
in that the Take Down notices are then sent over to Chilling Effects which
then publishes the letter along with other data gathered online then,
dedacted. The EU Commission should require that WHEN as letter is sent to
the Search Engines or site hosts demanding “take down” then the letter is
presumed confidential even

without that being marked on it. Most definitely that correspondence is not
to be turned over to Chilling Effects to publish and or raise funds off of
because a letter, as it stands in America, when sent through the US mails
has protections. Snail mail or email, until released in writing that notice
is the Intellectual Property of the sender.

The Rights and Functioning of the Single Market (II) adress the territorial
scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation
of the market through licensing agreements. In a normal brick based
licensing world, territory is defined. There is no definition of Territory
in an Internet world in that the minute SEND is clicked, what was released
can go anywhere without being stopped or tracked in that, like neighboring
Member States, not everyone gets along or cooperates hence the
egregiousness of the profit lost to a Content Creator who images are stolen
ie. appearing in IMAGE galleries on each and every of the Search Engines-
Google, Aol, Yahoo, Bing, etc. Those page deep Image pages are not Fair Use
in that FAIR USE states in American Law that if the use of the Content
prevents its Creator from making money then it is not Fair Use. More so,
the use of those Content in Image Galleries is not Fair Use in that making
an Thumbnail larger to Actual Size that can be reproduced from is,
statedly, NOT Fair Use. So the concept of issuing Licenses for “Europe” for
2D ARTS content creators, quite simply, is offensive when it comes time of
the month to pay the rent and other bills.

The issue of Librarians and libraries is raised. Times have changed. There
are far too many books in the world these days, raking in big bucks for
ISBN sellers in that it is mandatory to buy an ISBN for a book.
Realistically, librarians don’t want every book selling on Amazon in their
library, they only want the big name best sellers- JK Rowling, Stephen King
and Fifty Shades of Grey, so let’s be clear here, Library considerations
has less to do with books which can be downloaded for .99 cents or given
away, but about letting nice people who love books and people work at a
craft they adore. Ever watch the Librarian book cart races at their annual
conventions? I have…. It is a trip even watching them trip over THEIR hero,
Dame Julie Andrews set up with her daughter in their own imprint. The
reality of libraries is that sadly, sharing books library to library on the
internet is file sharing, so difficult to contain that book once it is
clicked ‘Adieu.’ There is no “temporary” or “on loan” in sending out a
library e-book. It is gone.

Sure there are stories about library books being stolen. The Brooklyn
Library copped to having 70,144 books being stolen in 2012. There is
something to be said for that people want books they can touch and feel,
the message being to

librarians IF the Brooklyn Library cannot contain theft of tangible,
touchable books off their shelves then how will Librarians contain, track
and enforce e-books stolen, well, out of thin e-air   [

There is the slight little issue of definition. What is a “Library?”

Google Definition says “li·brar·y ˈlīˌbrerē,-brərē/ noun
noun: library; plural noun: libraries
   1. a building or room containing collections of books, periodicals, and
      sometimes films and recorded music for people to read, borrow, or
      refer to.
   2. "a school library"

That definition is challenged with what occurred during the Occupy Wall
street protests in New York City. Books were read and left and organized in
to a library for the protesters living outside in the streets during their
“Occupation.” The New York City “occupation” was busted. The “library” is
said to have contained 5,000 books [
http://www.thenation.com/article/164766/peoples-library-occupy-wall-street-
lives ]  William Scott, a college professor who took his Sabbatical to join
in the Occupation, was the “occupation librarian.” So, what  is the EU
definition of Library going to be- six books in a coffee shop, 12 books on
a rolling cart for hospital and geriatric home patients,

Adressing requesting books across borders- yes. Both domestically and
internationally in researching MRLS- mare reproductive loss syndrome and
discovering fairly dependable documentation the disease began long before
2003, LONG before, 2003 and was not the promoted blight that was kismet of
cherry trees, caterpillars and abortion storms. Titles were tracked down
through library hyperlinks, emails were traded back and forth, phone call
was made to pay in advance for the research the librarians made the page
copies of with their having the skill to identify page and paragraph having
codified their library accordingly. Whole book was not needed. Just the
relevant pages which is under the definition of Fair Use.

There is a solution. Create a watermark signature to each library system
that brands, like a cow brand, each book to deter the book being copied.
Have ads that pop up, as does when one is reading articles on “The Nation”
website, that can be clicked off, as the ads pop up, indicating a person is
reading the e-book. With every convenience there is a price to pay.
Clicking at clicks is part of it, be it

for online classes or teaching. Adressing online classes, there is a
trending down from the online classes in that it is being learned students
are not doing as well as interaction in person classes allow the real in
person Social networking. There is also a contribution professors should
make here in that the trend in professors has been to self publishing their
own binders that students are required to purchase. AND, those binders are
marked copyrighted too. Teachers like profits just like the next person who
may not have a tenure that makes them handsome salaries, different from the
ARTs content creator, pursuing their dream, hoping to get paid at their
craft.

Important to adress is the conversation of disability and the Marakesh
Treaty. Having covered the testimony of a Silicon Valley “inventor” who is
quoted declaring he knew Napster and the Chaffee Amendment were his model
for books for the Blind- citing that the Chaffee Amendment gave him the
right to not pay author’s royalties, well, no, that is not what the Chaffee
Amendment states. And no, that is not what the Blind want. At an American
University follow up the Marakesh Treaty, the president of a major blind
organization stated that blind people don’t want charity. They want to be
treated like everyone else and that means paying for books and such. They
also acknowledged that blind people are content creators also.



Quite frankly with all the technology out in the world, there is the
challenge for someone to create an “online stamp” that appears, disappears
throughout the e-book at random sequences to show the book is an e-loan.
Off premises access to e-books should be a non starter. Not. To understand,
you know that woman with the torch at the beginning of movies, the woman
allegedly modeled for by Annette Benning, Warren Beatty’s wife, have a
watermark like of that figure appear throughout the book/video etc that is
on e-loan. And that ‘security’ would be set into motion when the book/video
is checked out. Otherwise, sadly, librarians like everyone else have to be
set to the same standard- maybe the library would go back to dealing in
paperbooks. Word is, books are not dead, despite what is being published on
the Internet.

Not everything sells everywhere or on everything or all markets. One cannot
bundle all rights. And there is no one answer for what is Fair
Compensation. Stealing of a Disney image is different than stealing of a
child’s art. That said, statutory is statutory when it comes to damages.
Caveat Empor, again. That did again, there is no one to say that a child’s
art or a painting elephant’s art or a painting dog’s art or a youtube
performer whose identity cannot become a major line with great equity,
contemporary- Justin Bieber, historical- Ann Frank,

The impression is a One Size Fits All solution is being sought. Not going
to work. Dancers, musicians, playwrights, filmmakers, Artists and
photographers have different needs. What does fit is the ONE thing that
works for all- STEAL- Crime- do the time- pay the dime. AND as Cesare
Bacceria said let people know right up front what will happen if they do
such. Simply, what can work and should  be implemented is AT THE TOPE OF
EACH WEBSITE PAGE IN BIG BOLD LETTERS STATE, bullet pointed and brief,
maybe even on a floating bubble that must be clicked to access the page as
indicated in attachments in this link

What might be considered is the Uniform Command concept of Alan Hiscox that
is a guideline for all member nations, but for God’s sake, write it in
Plain English as is an Executive Order President Obama wrote in to American
law in 2010                  [ www.plainlanguage.gov/plLaw ]. That said,
MAKE SURE that Order is Enforced. The guideline? Taking the writing of
these matters out of the hands of lawyers and let first grade teachers have
a crack at writing the “See Spot Run” version of it. With all the expense
invested into putting stuff online to reach people in their homes, then
scribe it readable for the ma’arm down the street.

Be clear that when a law is broken, it is never one law being broken it is
many broken at the same time. Law enforcement must have clarity too. On my
site, The Center For Copyright Integrity, [
www.centerforcopyrightintegrity.com ] I listed multiple levels of law
enforcement, not intending to show, in America, at least, how many levels
of enforcement are involved in the futile effort to stem online theft this
consultation chose not to adress. Point to be made is Look At All The
Agencies involved and listen to the news to all the exploding revelations
of millions of identities being compromised, in the least, President
Obama’s signature legacy Healthcare.gov

Copyright is an heirloom no different than the diamond on your honey’s left
hand. For some reason, the world is gone mad debating it Life+70 is long
enough in a world that allows people to own heirlooms for generations.
Technically, if copyright ‘term limits’ were  applied in a world that
allows people to own their heirlooms for generations, then European
families would not be able to own family relics going back generations,
castles would have been taken from family royal hands generations back and
the Queen’s Tiara’s given to Di and Kate, could, end up belonging to Posh &
Becks or the five year old next door.

This whole matter of Copyright and governments looking for cash when they
aught to go after the cash cows torpedoing economies by not paying taxes,
is

making life miserable for real citizens. This whole conversation is not
about Jobs, it is about Intellectual Property. People lose jobs. Take away
their Intellectual property, then how will they pay down college tuition,
day to day float, cover rent, buy food. There are still kitchen tables but
the opportunity to build a business at a kitchen table is rocky. And that
is what the EU needs to look at- the imbalance of Millions tossed by
Venture Capitalists at Start Ups with innovative ideas, some being bought
just to eliminate Tech giants competition , or money being tossed for newer
better more devious ways to gather Consumer data. Lets get real, does a
woman really need a bra to let her know she is in lust or love or…. Is it
the Algorithms Big Data is going after.

Quite frankly, it is not the Big Data that bakes cookies for their European
Commission, Co.Co puffs. Final run down- hyperlinking is fine, copying is
not, taking without permission is stealing? You disagree, well then mark me
down for 5:00, London time, when I will  be by to empty out your family
heirlooms. Yes. Copyrights are heirlooms, too. Let’s see how you like it
when something you value is taken from you just because, well, that person
likes it and wants to.

When it come to the Internet, don’t just leave well enough alone. Make it
better. Back the Internet off the stalking. People aren’t products for sale-
 in flesh and blood or in their identity. Good people really want their
lives to get better. Some want to be overnight youtube stars. Others want
to be entrepreneurs. For that? They need their IP. Make sure they get to
keep it. And, for what ever it is worth, realize, that private companies
taking people’s data is a criminal activity, legislators in America are
beginning to explore along with the trail of those illicit funds away from
home states, in to haven states and to shores where multiple corporate
shells are set up as funds are being distracted.

Protect the legacy of ARTS Content Creators. Defer to the Ten Commandments
of the ARTS 2D, IP, ID & Commerce. Refer to the Social Media Bill of Rights
                 [ www.centerforcopyrightintegrity.com ] And when it comes
to changing laws to benefit Technology and activists? One word…. Don’t.
Remind the Technology Activists there are laws on the books that have
withstood the test of time. Tell them to correct their business models to
be in compliance with the laws…. Otherwise the only thing that will be in
the clouds? Well, quoting Ralph Cramden, Jackie Gleason’s character on The
Honeymooners when he was displeased with his wife, telling her where he was
going to send her….….

Bang… Zoom… to the Moon (Alice)
                                                  … to the Moon!!!!!
