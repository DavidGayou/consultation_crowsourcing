                    European Commission’s Public Consultation
                     on the Review of the EU Copyright Rules
           Responses to the questionnaire submitted by MARQUES

 MARQUES is the European association representing brand owners‟ interests. Its mission is to
 be the trusted voice for brand owners.
 MARQUES is an accredited organisation before the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal
 Market (OHIM), appointed observer at the OHIM Administrative Board and Budget
 Committee, an official non-governmental observer at the World Intellectual Property
 Organisation and a registered interest representative organisation (ID number
 97131823590-44) in the Transparency Register set up by the European Parliament and
 the European Commission, which extends and replaces the former Register of Interest
 Representatives, opened by the Commission in 2008.
 Established in 1986 and later incorporated in the United Kingdom as a not-for-profit company
 limited by guarantee, MARQUES„ membership crosses all industry lines and includes brand
 owners and IP professionals in more than 80 countries. MARQUES unites European and
 international brand owners across all product sectors to address issues associated with the use,
 protection and value of Intellectual Property (IP) rights, as these are an important cornerstone
 of the European economy and the EU‟s Internal Market, all vital to innovation, growth and job
 creation. They provide significant value to their owners and wider wholesale and retail circles.
 At the same time, IP provides significant recognition-value directly to the consumers and
 safeguards public confidence. It is thus important to protect IP rights to enable them continue
 to fulfill all of these important functions.
 Therefore, MARQUES has very much appreciated the initiatives that the European
 Commission has incited to address the new challenges for IP rights in the digital Single
 Market, including those associated with content protection in the digital environment, and in
 this context, the ongoing review of the EU copyright legislative framework. MARQUES also
 supports the October 2013 European Council Conclusions that: "Providing digital services
 and content across the single market requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the
 digital age […]. It is important to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate
 licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of intellectual property rights and taking
 into account cultural diversity" [Emphasis added] and agrees on the European Commission‟s
 consideration that need be of ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit
 for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full
 potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in economy and promote cultural
 diversity. MARQUES appreciates that such need has to be balanced with an appropriate
 system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement, adapted to respond to the challenges
 that the digital technology and the Internet have brought forward and welcome the opportunity
 of giving answer to the questionnaire of the Commission‟s Consultation as its contribution.

    I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A.    Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in
Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation
of the market through licensing agreements]
1.       [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?
 YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)
Due to licensing issues, or at least complications, there are limitations concerning, in particular,
streaming media services. For instance Netflix is available only in a number of EU countries,
such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and the Netherlands
Also mobile apps and services do not always continue to work when one leaves its country.
  NO
  NO OPINION
2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking to
provide online services across borders in the EU?
 YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright or
to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across borders,
compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples indicating
the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as
certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
The examples are the same as those mentioned in the preceding answer, just from the service
provider‟s perspective.




3.        [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
We are not asked to grant such licenses. Nevertheless, in any event, multi-territorial licenses
have a too narrow scope given the fact that they apply solely to the online licensing of author‟s
rights in musical works, which can represent a limitation to the number of multi-territorial
licenses asked. Also, differences of substantive copyright law among Member States still may
pose some problems to cross-border licensing and it appears that further harmonisation of
substantive copyright law is required.
4.       If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]



                                                 2
We think that a stronger unification of copyright laws among Member States is necessary.
Although harmonisation is sought by the proposal for a Directive, major differences from
Member State to Member State remain. For instance, the Commission leaves in the parties‟
(right holders) autonomy to choose a collecting society and does not clarify whether such
collecting society is obliged to contract with all right holders. In contrast, the laws of several
Member States establish such an obligation of contracting. This kind of disparities may create
barriers to cross border licensing as there is a large part of copyright that still remains a national
matter.
5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories
in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a
service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible
in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
 NO
Today the European Union is much more than an economic Union, also being a Community of
common values and liberties, such as freedom of speech and information. These core principles
should be respected. It is true that Member States are (still) free to make own moral choices, and
there are also internal security reasons. Nevertheless, in our view, everyone has the right to be
fully informed about any topic that does not seem to have an implication on such Member
State‟s choices. Also, territorial restrictions could hamper competition and the functioning of
the Internal Market.
  NO OPINION
6.      [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the
service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than
the one he is trying to access)?
        – Please explain by giving examples
 NO
Please see the answer to the preceding question.


7.      Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
 YES – Please explain
We think that further harmonisation of substantive copyright is needed. Indeed, the way of
licensing varies from one Member State to the other and there still are diverging national
traditions of collective rights management which creates barriers where “online rights” are
concerned.
In our view, there is a need for low cost, consumer friendly mechanism to resolve low-value
cross-border issues where the customer has not been served by the company. If this existed then
buying copyright material from one country or platform and using it in another country or on
another platform would be much easier. Licensing across borders is of limited value unless there
is such a mechanism. Consumers do not buy from platforms in other countries very often
because if there is a problem, there is no clear path to resolution.

                                                  3
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION

B.      Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised
(or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
8.      Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
  YES
 NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)
In our view, the Directive should be modified in order to clarify the scope of the “making
available” right, in particular the “localisation” of this right.
The “targeting” approach proposed by the CJEU seems to be a good compromise solution as it
avoids the problems posed, on the one hand, by the “country of origin” or “server” approach as
this could entail that those that wish to make a certain content available would place their server
in a non-EU country in order to avoid the application of EU substantive copyright provisions
and, on the other hand, it also eliminates the disadvantages brought about by having the place of
receipt of the communication as the only relevant factor for the determination of the applicable
law, as in this case the law of each and every Member State where the content was made
available would apply which would of course be too cumbersome on the Internet actors.
Nevertheless, a "country of origin" approach may be easier to enforce. An approach considering
the place of transmission (broadcasting), the place of the uploading or the place where the
provider is established could be suitable. As usual, a framework should be elaborated and an
interpretation by CJEU and National Courts could follow.
  NO OPINION
9.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of
the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether
you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred
your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
availability of injunctive relief)?
 YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
Please see the answer to the preceding question.
If we adopt the “targeting” approach, then one could receive the content and still be outside of
the scope of this right provided that they do not belong to the target public of the service
provider.
Likewise, where the enforcement of copyright laws is concerned, the server provider can be
located in a non-EU country and still be subject to the legal framework of EU Member State
provided that the target audience is located in such Member State.
Also, an easier location of the copyright attempt acts would permit the enforcement of the right,
injunctive relief could be for example allowed by the competent Court.
  NO
  NO OPINION




                                                 4
1.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
10.      [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
 YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to
achieve the "bundling of rights")
Given the significance of the download operations in today‟s digital market, the situation
regarding which rights are involved should be addressed and clarified on the legislative level.
The facilitation of joint licenses could also help to clarify the situation.




2.      Linking and browsing
11.     Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
 NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
It depends: if the link at issue leads directly to concrete copyright protected material then we
believe that the right of making available and the corresponding authorisation of the right holder
should apply; if the link solely refers to a website from which a protected work can then be
assessed, in our view, such links should not be covered by the right holder‟s authorisation.
Nevertheless, it should be taken into account that a hyperlink is more than potentially accessible
content, i.e. it is often used as it is faster and it is only a way to avoid the whole sending of the
work. Furthermore, the possible and probable subsequent reproduction will not necessarily be
temporary (different from the mere act of viewing a web page). A hyperlink could appear as a
“technical way” for communicating the work to the public easily and quickly. It allows access
to the work and the author should be able to decide on this communication/dissemination in the
digital environment also. However, as we cannot be certain of the activation of the hyperlink by
the receiver, and as it could only contain fragments of the work which are consequently covered
by the exception of the right to quote, the authorisation of the right holder should be required
only under specific circumstances.
     NO OPINION


12.     Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a
work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject
to the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
 NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)


                                                  5
These types of copies should be deemed as falling within the scope of Article 5(1) of Directive
2001/29/EC exception. Indeed, given that we are dealing with the very essence of how the
internet works today, at least in most cases, cached browser copies seem to fulfil all the
conditions provided for in Article 5(1) for the application of the exception. The copy moreover
will be evanescent and without economic significance. Naturally, this exception solely covers
the mere browsing and not anymore the cases where the web pages are downloaded or printed.
     NO OPINION

3.        Download to own digital content
13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
 YES – Please explain by giving examples
For example, the music bought on multimedia platforms, such as iTunes, is protected by
technological protection measures prohibiting resale.
A library of material assembled by a person on a device should be the property of that person if
lawfully paid for. It is distressing that in the event of a death, platform providers claim
ownership of the material and do not transfer it to relatives.
     NO
     NO OPINION
14.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
Some companies have applied for patents for this kind of systems. The major consequence is
that these transmissions are much easier to multiply than the exchanges involved in the typical
distribution right. Here the operation of buying and selling digital content is made between end-
users which should entail (and this seems to be the main challenge posed by the volatility of
digital content as opposed to physical copies) that the rights involved are managed so that the
user that sells the content can no longer access it once it is sold. However, this possibility could
reduce the author‟s profits and, instead, raise the profits of the intermediate that manages the
rights and that probably will charge a fee for the resale.

C.        Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
 YES
     NO
     NO OPINION
16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
A centralised system could increase the harmonisation of the protection of copyrights that is still
in many ways absent within the EU. Such a system would help dating the creation,
identifying the rightholder and the work. It would make it easier to enforce the copyright
owner‟s rights and to prosecute infringers. Also, it would facilitate multi-licensing and the


                                                 6
resale of previously purchased digital content would be easier to manage if the rights of the
copyright owner are registered.
17.       What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
We believe that such a system should probably be optional rather than mandatory and perhaps
only offer a presumption of ownership. Indeed a system of mandatory registration where the
Berne Convention expressly states that the enjoyment and the exercise of this right is not subject
to any formality could create unreasonable barriers to the protection of copyright and perhaps an
excessive commodification of copyright. A registration system like this should be accessible to
everyone and completely free of charge. Moreover, before introducing such a system, national
dispositions need more harmonisation.
18.       What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
A longer term of protection and an easier enforcement of rights.



D.        How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
Legislation should be adopted, in our view, in order to increase the use of common identifiers
and to promote the development of interoperability as this facilitates the process of rights
clearance, distribution and multi-licensing. It could also help to resolve the problem of orphan
works as discoverability of works would be facilitated.




E.        Term of protection – is it appropriate?
20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
 YES – Please explain
Taking into account that in the digital environment, technology changes fast and there is a
continual renewal and the ways of dissemination and creation are faster than before, one could
argue that there seems to be no reason why a longer period should be established than fifty years
provided for in the Berne Convention.
However, in our view, the work of creation is still the same. That work, in principle, needs to be
fairly protected during the creator‟s entire life, and after his death, during a period which reward
the creator‟s heirs for the investment made and for the intellectual work.
Additionally, it would be good if the term of protection and the exceptions to the exploitation
rights were the same in all EU member States.
     NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
     NO OPINION



                                                    7
     I.    Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
We think that the exceptions should be further harmonised, especially for cross-border
situations and to facilitate the free movement of goods/works/ideas as well as for protecting
some fundamental rights.
For instance, as the education is a fundamental right, the teaching exception should not be
optional for the Member States in our view.
There are some exceptions, in particular those related with science and education, that
correspond to a public interest. Leaving Member States the choice of implementing such
exceptions or not may create a problem of access to knowledge and information.
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION
22.     Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a
higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
We believe that all of the exceptions should be mandatory as that would increase harmonisation
of copyright and make clear what EU end users – rather than country A and country B users –
can and cannot do.
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION
23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
The existing exceptions should be adapted to the increasingly digitalised world. For instance,
quotation and citation, should cover audio, images and video.
In addition, for instance, compared to the French exceptions to copyright, the EU system did not
recognise an exception for parody, pastiche and caricature even if freedom of expression is a
fundamental EU right.
24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree
of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
 YES – Please explain why
There should be a higher degree of flexibility in our view as to opening the currently exhaustive
list of exceptions so that the possibilities and rights of users can be adapted to the technological
developments.
  NO – Please explain why
  NO OPINION
25.     If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open
norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and

                                                 8
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
A mix of several solutions, but particularly a revision of the Directive 2001/29/EC in order to
open the exhaustive list of exceptions, create new exceptions and make all exceptions
mandatory. Also use of an open standard could create the necessary flexibility. A new
framework should be created and interpretation by the CJEU and national courts could follow.

Advantage of flexibility would show that the legal system is more future proof, the disadvantage
being that there is just a bit less legal certainty as the law will then not be fully conclusive. The
effect on the Internal Market will in our view be positive. As EU trademark law shows, use of
open standards / autonomous legal concepts will give the CJEU room to manoeuvre in specific
new cases in the advantage of the Internal Market.

26.     Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
 YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
We believe exceptions should be harmonised in order to avoid differences in their application
amongst different EU Member States.
For instance, the exception of the use of works for educative purposes in Spain is only referred
to activities conducted within taught sessions. It does not include the free reproduction and
distribution of third parties works by the teacher to their students as study materials, as it seems
it could be the exception for the use of contents for educative purposes set in the Directive.
The access to works for the purpose of non-commercial research should be easier in cross-
borders cases.
Indeed it is not conceivable to envisage search activities without an international approach. A
global license with a slight compensation to the rightholders could be proposed. We could also
think about the absence of compensation which could be justified by the purpose of the use of
the work.
Also putting a work into the public domain is impossible in some Member States. The
territoriality of limitations constitutes a problem for the question of exhaustion of rights.
According to the EU system, the distribution right and only the distribution right is subject to
the exhaustion principle. Nevertheless, in some Member States, such as France, the
reproduction right could also be subject to the exhaustion principle. In France, to date the
distribution right is not clearly transposed and could to some extent correspond to the
reproduction right.
Nevertheless, for instance, French copyright law also recognises a „destination‟ right, which
enables the creator to control, after the work‟s communication to the public, some uses of his
work which could be done by others. This „destination right‟ strongly limits the possible
exhaustion of the reproduction right.
Such contradiction could lead to different applications of the exhaustion principle by Member
States and could cause unfair situations for rights holders and users.
  NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to




                                                 9
27.     In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have
cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such
compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
Harmonising “fair compensation” across the EU Member States, establishing, for instance,
through a harmonised levy system for the private copying of copyrighted works.

A.        Access to content in libraries and archives
28.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
 YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
In e.g. Spain, in case of an exhibition for general interest and not-for-profit, problems arise with
the use in public libraries where librarians‟ cannot exhibit several works nor loan, given the fact
that these works are very damaged but may not be copied. The public can at most read these
works in special public spaces in the libraries with very dim light. We experienced such
difficulties with both orphan works and copyrighted works.
In our opinion, one of the biggest problems to face is the risk of damage of such works, even to
the extent that after a certain time these work become insuperable damaged.
     NO


29.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
In the implementation of the Directive 2001/29/EC, every Member State should create methods
and systems for copying, rehearing and restoring. In our opinion, in case of problems, such as
those underlined in our answer to question 28, every Member State should create a rule system
that provides for the possibility of a preservation copy, albeit access to this copy should be
limited to authorised users without commercial intentions.
30.     If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements?
Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under which
conditions?
[Open question]
The main elements should in our view be based upon a combination of both public interests as
well as the author‟s interests. The current Directive only allows for the author‟s interests. We
believe that the last decision should be the author‟s, but also the public interests should be
considered. In order to guarantee that the copy can only be accessed by authorised people, it is
also necessary to draw up rules as to the use of such copy by the public institution in the
interest of the author.
31.      If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
 [Open question]
We think that every Member State has the responsibility to implement methods and systems for
rehearing, copying and restoring orphan works of collective interest. By the way, Member
States should be free to outsource such task to private or semi-public entities.As to copyright
protected works the decision should be the author‟s, but we believe that the author should be
bound to act in favour of public interest and not contrary to it.

4.      Off-premises access to library collections
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide
remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of
research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in the
collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not on the
premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with institutional
users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across borders, to the
works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private study?
[Open question]
Yes, for instance in Spain, a large volume of works can only be physically accessed at the
library site. Off-site access is not allowed. As far as we know, the majority of the works may be
booked on-line for lending, but cannot be consulted on-line. Only recently, for example, books
can be lent also as e-book.

From our experience many authors do not voluntarily wish to enter into such agreements.

33.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Within the framework of the current Directive, we think that the principle of possible public
interest of a work should be implemented. Doing so would balance the various interests at stake,
such as those of the authors, those of the public institution and those in general, i.e. public
interest as to culture and instruction.
34.     If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements?
Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under which
conditions?
[Open question]
We think that it is necessary to implement other methods of (allowed) access in order to consult
works (on line), under payment of a small compensation.

35.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
See answer to question 20.

5.      E – lending
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across
borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries to
enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
 YES – Please explain with specific examples

                                               11
For instance in Italy, in case of e-lending, it is necessary to pay and it is not possible to consult
the same e-book on a tool different from the one where the e-book has been downloaded.
     NO


37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
The author should have a final say, but we believe that we also need to consider the public
interests in a work. In other words if the work is of public interest - and insofar it does not result
in serious losses for the author - the author should be bound to consent to lending, copying and
the like, in the public interest.
38.     [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
The main differences and problems result from the characteristics of the use of digital versus
paper works. In case of digital works, there are more problems to control. Hence, it is important
to implement legislation that should assist the control of digital works, taking always into
consideration the public interest.
39.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between libraries’
traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such as
off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you
encountered?
[Open question]
See the answer to previous question.



6.        Mass digitisation
40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border
effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
 YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
For instance, Spain does not have legislation regarding digitisation. Nevertheless, the majority
doctrine states that if one has a distribution agreement, then digitisation is (also) allowed
because the digitisation does not generate new rights to the author.
As for e.g. Italy, we believe that it is necessary to implement a new law that provides for the
conditions for digitalisation, in particular with regards to the choice of the works, and the
criteria of compensation of the authors.
     NO – Please explain
     NO OPINION
41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other
types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
 YES – Please explain


                                                 12
With regard to public works, the Member States should implement such mechanisms for
digitalisation, copying and restoration. They can outsource this task to private or semi-public
companies.
The author should have a final say, but we believe that we need to also consider the public
interests in a work. In other words, if the work is of public interest - and insofar it does not
result in serious losses for the author - the author should be bound to consent to lending,
copying and the like, in the public interest.
     NO – Please explain
     NO OPINION

B.        Teaching
42.       (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting
from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for teaching,
including across borders?
 YES – Please explain
Yes, for instance in Spain, some authors do not permit use of their works for illustration for
teaching.
 NO
Generally, we do not experience much difficulties. However, the fact that that the author has the
final say, creates some insecurity. Nevertheless, in at least some Member States the laws allow
for use of a part of a work for teaching purposes without a license.


43.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
For instance as to use of a work for teaching purposes, we think that the current Directive
should permit use without authorisation.
44.      What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
On line availability and digitalisation of works. We do not know how successful they are.
45.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements?
Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
See the answer to question 43.
46.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
We believe that – in accordance with the current Directive – the author should have the final
say. Nevertheless we believe that we also need to consider the public interests in a work. If the
work is of public interest – and insofar it does not result in serious losses for the author – the
author should be bound to consent to free access, in the public interest.

                                                 13
Also with respect to the exhibition of a work for educational purposes, we believe it should not
be necessary the obtain permission by the author.

C.        Research
47.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the context
of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting
from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of research
projects/activities, including across borders?
 YES – Please explain
In some countries such problems have been experienced, because a research license is not
compulsory and private companies do not always voluntarily agree.
     NO


48.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
In any case, with respect to (at least non-commercial) research projects/activities, we believe
that the use of works should always be open to the public, to avoid duplicated projects.
49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]



D.        Disabilities
50.     (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in special
formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting
from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication
of works published in special formats, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
 NO
We do not have this experience. In some Member States, e.g. Italy, indeed the law provides for
an exception for copies addressed to disabled, provided that such works are, amongst other
things, strictly linked to the disabilities.


51.       If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]
Implement exceptions like in Italy.

                                                14
52.    What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content? How
successful are they?
[Open question]
We consider that it is the responsibility of Member States to implement mechanisms for these
people.
For sure, in our view, when an author grants permission for distribution of its works this
permission should also (automatically) include the right to distribute to persons with disabilities.
The main mechanism are:
- To make audios for literary works.
- To make subtitles to describe the images of a film.
- Each Member State should create infrastructure to give access to people with reduced
mobility. For example in museums or galleries.



E.        Text and data mining
53.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting
from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content, including
across borders?
     YES – Please explain
 NO – Please explain
No, at least not yet. The legal status of the copies required for text and data mining are,
however, currently subject to debate. There is (as yet) too little case law, respectively the
legislation is not specific enough, at least in some Member States, to be certain of the exact
legal situation. Nevertheless, many people seem to agree that data mining can be legitimate use,
although it does not fit well in the current copyright framework of (exhaustive) exceptions.



54.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
More clarity on what is legitimate use and more flexibility in the legal framework of copyright
exceptions.
55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements?
Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
In our view the framework of copyright exceptions should not be exhaustive, or should contain
open legal standards (like: fair use, reasonableness and fairness, or three step test) to make
copyright law more flexible and future proof.
56.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
//


                                                 15
57.      Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
Yes, also data base rights may apply.

F.        User-generated content
58.      (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from the
way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content
on the Internet, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
 NO


59.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in
this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that are
publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)
through your service to properly identify these works for online use?
     YES – Please explain
     NO – Please explain
 NO OPINION
60.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you
experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you have created
(on the basis of pre-existing works)?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for
users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service?
     YES – Please explain
     NO – Please explain
 NO OPINION
61.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
User Generated Content (UGC) is a bottleneck nowadays. At this moment, use of copyright
protected works for UGC may infringe copyrights, regardless of the intent of the author of the
UGC. A solution to this problem could be to include a copyright exception for UGC for non
commercial purposes and under strict conditions (e.g. identification right), or to make use of
open standards (see Q55).
Also problems may be solved by creating more functional ways that users and right holders can
get in contact with each other.

                                               16
62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements?
Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
See previous answer. Non-commercial use of copyright protected works for the purpose of
generating UGC should be considered legitimate, provided that strict conditions, as to e.g.
identification and fair use, are met. Probably the use of an open legal standard would provide
more flexibility and the chance to respond to (social) developments.

63.         If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
//

      II.      Private copying and reprography

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the
private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?
Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.
 YES – Please explain
Considering the principle of one EU market and the free flow of goods on the one hand, and the
fact that Internet and copyright protection by its nature is transboundary (even though the level
of protection may still vary per Member State) on the other, we believe in a unilateral approach.
It gives more legal certainty.
The application of the private copying and reprography exceptions should be harmonised. In for
instance Spain private copying levies had been applied indiscriminately. Now there is some
uncertainty in relation to how should private copying levies be applied to end users and
distributed amongst the authors. Therefore a harmonised system/method or formula would be
good in this sense in order to avoid legal uncertainties in this respect. Moreover, we believe it
should be noted that there is a desire amongst consumers who purchase copyright material to
use such material freely across platforms. Companies like Apple which restrict the number of
appliances you can access material on should be encouraged to end such restrictions (which
even apply across devices in the Apple family).
     NO – Please explain
     NO OPINION
65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?
 YES – Please explain
If the service pays the right holder per use event/click (e.g. Spotify), then unlimited use is not
bought off. In that context a digital copy, which may result in numerous communications not
involving the service, should be subject to private copying levies.
 NO – Please explain
If the service allows for reuse without additional payment (e.g. iTunes), then unlimited use by
the right holder is in fact already bought off. In that context a digital copy should be considered
legitimate use.
Also, in Member States where a private copying exception has been transposed and copies are
in fact put on a reproduction device which is already subject to payment of levies, we believe
that digital copies cannot be subject to further copying levies as that would result in double
payment.



                                                   17
66.     How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
Changes in levies directly influence the consumer price. The higher the price, the greater the
chance that users will look for other – non legitimate – services. On the other hand, lower
levies, or at least providing more flexible use for what is paid for, may attract people to use
legitimate services. Also, the amount of levies is decisive for the rightholders‟ revenue.
67.      Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?
 YES – Please explain
It could create awareness (and as a result support) among the public regarding the free use of
copyright protected material versus the rights of right holders to get a remuneration.
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION
68.    Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue
levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
 YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.
Taking reference from experience matured for instance in the electronics sector, it seems that
electronics producers may face problems in this respect. Many electronics manufacturers import
goods into the EU, by using a central logistics hub and after that distributing the goods to
different EU Member States. In theory, the legislation of various countries requires payment of
the levy upon import. Especially if the goods are then resold to another entity it is not always
easy for the buyer to reclaim the levies when re-exporting to another EU country. But in the
destination country again the levy is due. As a result, we have experienced that some parties had
to make duplicate payments. We do not have data on percentages. The amount of levies and the
nature of the products on which a levy is due, differ from country to country. There is no level
playing field in the EU for the normal distribution systems. Many grey online traders take
advantage of the price differences between the various countries as a result of the difference in
levies, making the situation for the regulation retailers quite complicated. Many grey dealers
would in those situations technically be obliged to pay the levies in the country of the consumer
buying the product (cf. CJEU 16 June 2011, C-462/09, Thuiskopie v Opus), but the reality of
the situation is that the collection societies do not go after these grey online traders. This distorts
the regular trade in these products, taking an unfair advantage of not paying the levies due. We
do not only see this happening where there is a big difference in levies between the different EU
Member States, but also between the EU and Switzerland. Some grey traders bring goods into
Switzerland and then offer these to EU consumers, not paying the copyright levies (and also
taking advantage of the VAT free and duty free import for goods below EUR 22).
Apart from the discussion whether the system is fair (as in the current situation consumers pay
the levy (1) also for song for which they have already paid e.g. via iTunes and (2) for every time
a copy ends up on a device in their household, e.g. one on the phone, one on the tablet, one on
the new mp3 player, one on the old mp3 player, one on the back-up drive), the differences
between the way levies are calculated in the EU lead to unfair competition.
  NO – Please explain



                                                  18
69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions result
in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of products, type
of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
We do not know what the percentage is. However, case law shows that such transactions do
result in undue payments.
See for instance DC The Hague, 20 Feb. 2013 (Thuiskopie vs Imation) with reference to the
Padawan decision of the CJEU. Said Dutch case shows that Imation was forced to pay a levy,
also on blanc data dvd‟s and cd‟s for professional use only, by the collecting society for home
tape levies in The Netherlands.
As mentioned in answer to question 64 above, in relation to Spain, the Padawan decision
showed that the application of the private copy levies in Spain was indiscriminate and therefore
not in accordance with the Directive.
70.     Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?
We do not know, but in any event we expect that this percentage will vary widely in the various
Member States.
71.     If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
We believe that legal harmonisation on this point would tackle the problems vigorously.

  III.       Fair remuneration of authors and performers

72.     [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
We do not know what the best mechanism is, but rights and remuneration ensuing from
collective administration are guaranteed to all authors. From this perspective, one could say that
collective administration is equally adequate for all.
73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
 YES – Please explain
We believe there is a need, at least for providers, to have a one stop shop as far as obtaining
licenses is concerned. At this moment, licenses still have to be obtained from collecting
societies in the various Members States. This not only negatively influences cross border
transactions, it also causes additional transaction costs and hinders new digital initiatives. These
negative influences, in our view also (consequently) adversely influence the income of authors.
         – Please explain why


74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
A legal model that would advance one stop shopping and encourage new digital initiatives. We
understand that the Simulcasting model could have such effect and result in a one stop shop for
the repertoire of the collecting societies, but maybe there are other effective models as well.



                                                19
   IV.      Respect for rights
75.     Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 YES – Please explain
In principle, intent is irrelevant for the question of infringement, although it matters for certain
ancillary claims. Whether the infringing use is committed with a commercial purpose is in itself
also still irrelevant, although we feel that such circumstance should make a difference in the
remedies. We believe that, in an online era, personal use should be distinguished from
commercial use, also to broaden the level of public support as to copyrights.
As to enforcement, we think that there is a need for an on-line administrative complaint system
for content owners to take down sites which infringe their copyright. The examples of the
UDRP, created by WIPO, and now the URS as used for domain names would be a good place to
start looking in our view.
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION
76.     In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
No, we think it is not. Service providers are in essence passive. We think that a useful measure
may be the use of a compulsory „black list‟, which is shared between providers. Also, a further
liability of service providers for infringement with a commercial purpose by their members,
shall likely foster cooperation and (contractual and technical) initiatives to prevent such
infringements in their domain.
77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
 YES – Please explain
In our view, the current framework and case law (notice and take down system) gives a rather
balanced enforcement system in which copyrights do not hinder initiatives. Nevertheless, it does
not make a distinction between the purpose or intent of the infringement.
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION

         V. A single EU Copyright Title

78.     Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU,
as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 YES
  NO
  NO OPINION


                                                20
79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
We believe that the goal of one EU market in which goods can freely circulate implies that
intellectual property should also be European property, or at least the scope of protection should
be harmonized on a EU level. We see no reason why this should be a longer term project.
Recent case law of the CJEU shows that already a start has been made in harmonising
copyrights in the EU.

   VI.     Other issues

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
If the aim of the Commission is to ease on-line commerce and balance consumer rights and
those of the artist/copyright owner, then we think that also some attention needs to be given to
the Data Protection laws. It is becoming increasingly difficult to track the owners of sites which
contain copyright infringement in the EU because domain name registrars are being allowed to
opt out of providing accurate, up to date, freely available whois information on who they sell
domain names to. The Commission is involved in creating circumstances to protect private data.
Whilst this is a good thing as such, we believe that also has a negative effect, namely frustrating
law enforcement by rights owners in the advantage of criminals.
