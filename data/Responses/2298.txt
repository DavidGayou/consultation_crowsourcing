EU Copyright Consultation

The University of Manchester Response


1.       [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to access
online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?

YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned
(e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)

Due to blanket licensing and broadcast restrictions, we are unable to provide access to broadcasts to staff and
students based outside of the UK. This is particularly problematic for distance learners and students based at
partner institutions. Licence fees have increased for UK based students, but do not reflect an increase in the
provision of services. These licensing and broadcast restrictions significantly limit the amount of resources that
staff can use within their teaching materials which therefore reduces opportunities for students.



4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what would be the
best way to tackle them?

The introduction of a new exception (or limitation) permitting both the recording of broadcasts and the
communication of those broadcasts via secure networks (i.e. Virtual Learning Environments) for educational
purposes would address this issue. Contract terms and technical protection measures should not be allowed to
override these exceptions.



7.      Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions)
are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market,
while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?

YES – Please explain

Territoriality in licensing is a barrier to cross-border availability of content and services. For a Single Market to
be able to function in the digital realm, regulations need to be simplified and consistent.



11.      Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under
copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?

NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances,
and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public – or to a new public, or
because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

No, hyperlinks should not be subject to the authorisation of the rightsholder. Hyperlinks act as digital signposts
to direct users to online content/information and are absolutely vital to the functionality of the internet. Any
restrictions placed on using hyperlinks would reduce the ease of access to information currently afforded
online.
Recent judgements in the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) i.e. Svensson and Others v Retriever
Sverige AB (C466/12) support the use of hyperlinks when directing users to works which are already publicly
available. For University staff and students to be able to direct each other to specific resources online, it is
essential that hyperlinks can be shared freely without any restrictions or need for licensing.



12.      Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or
other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s
computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, or be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?

NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances,
and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

No, viewing of a webpage should not be subject to the authorisation of the rightsholder. The Internet provides
access to information and the viewing of a webpage is the standard result of using it. Obtaining permission to
view and read material already made available online would be severely restrictive and unnecessary since
rightsholders are already able to restrict access to their content if appropriate (such as placing the content
behind a password-protected site).



15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of
works and other subject matter?

YES

A registration system at EU level would definitely help to identify works which are protected by copyright and
who the rights owners are. At present, it is often difficult to discover and/or contact rights owners for
permission to use works outside the scope of limitations and exceptions.

For the system to be effective it would need to be marketed well across the EU and rightsholders should be
able to self-register. Any forms created should seek to gather as much information as possible by making fields
mandatory rather than optional. Data should be kept up to date and as much work as possible should be
completed by the rightsholders.

Rightsholders of non-commercial works should have the ability to register for free providing they are
responsible for the maintenance of their own data. Under the EU Orphan Works Directive libraries, museums
and educational establishments are already being required to “register” Orphan Works.



16.      What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

Finding information about rights holders can be a long, time consuming and invariably frustrating process. A
registration system would make it easier to trace rights holders and seek the necessary permission to reuse
materials. This would be particularly beneficial for research activities and developing teaching materials.

A registration system would also assist with clearing permissions for making our heritage and art collections
available online, as well as leading to less orphan works and facilitating how creators take action against any
infringements.



17.      What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

The administrational side of the system has to be efficient and effective. The system needs to be relatively
straight forward to use in order to facilitate the overall process so that both the rightsholders and those
seeking permission are not bogged down by red tape.

20.      Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?

NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

Generally, current copyright is life plus 70 year, i.e. in literary and artistic works, dramatic and musical works,
as well as sound recordings and film. This is 20 years longer than is required by international law. Therefore
the current terms of copyright protection are too long. This puts unnecessary restrictions on using material
that is no longer commercially exploitable. For libraries such as our own this represents a significant part of our
archival collections. In order to reproduce items from our collections for our own use, and that of researchers
and students, it can involve a lengthy process to find the rightsholders several generations after the creator
has died. Therefore, the duration of copyright in the EU should fall into line with international norms at life
plus 50 years as appropriate.



21.     Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU
copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

Yes. There is currently no consistency within the EU for users of copyright works in the single market. This
makes the cross-border use of copyright works problematic. Since cross border research and teaching
activities are now common place, this impacts on collaboration with our research partners across Europe, as
they are unable to access the same copyright works. This also impacts on our ability to provide equal access to
students on the same course but based in different countries as they are not able to access the same
resources. This is not only an issue within the EU, but also the worldwide digital environment. It is important
that the EU take a lead to begin to solve this problem.



22.     Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level
of harmonisation of such exceptions?

YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

All the exceptions in the Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC and other existing and future Directives in
copyright relating to education, learning and research should be applied across the board within the EU. This
would then allow for the greater circulation of knowledge around Europe. Exceptions should also be easily
amended or added to in response to any technological development.



23.     Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue?
Please explain by referring to specific cases.

[Open question]

No exceptions should be removed. The following suggestions would significantly improve the ability of our
institution to support students, teaching staff and researchers in their work:

1. Contracts and technical protection measures should never undermine/override existing and new limitations
and exceptions in the EU. It should also be an offence to impose technical protection measures on any
material that is no longer in copyright;

2. Libraries should have a ‘right to lend’ which would include the right to lend digital media such as e-books by
remote download. This would allow parity with the existing lending of analogue materials;

3. A new exception for text and data mining should be introduced, for all purposes, commercial and non-
commercial, as well as published and unpublished works. This is vital to the continued advancement of
research;

                                                        3
4. A new exception for the mass digitisation of out-of-commerce works (including orphan works) for non-
commercial purposes by libraries, archives and museums. This would provide users with access to a vast
collection of cultural and historical heritage. The exception should allow such institutions to communicate the
works to the public without the need for a diligent search for each individual rights holder.

5. A new exception which would allow educational establishments to record and communicate broadcasts to
students based elsewhere in the EU would be of great benefit. This would help provide students with
consistent access to resources, regardless of their location.

6. Preservation activities should be supported through an exception that allows for these activities to happen
across networks and inter-institutions. As the balance of these preservation activities continues to shift away
from exclusively analogue materials to increasingly digital, it is vital that preservation copies can be stored in
multiple locations.

7. Publicly funded research should be made available openly regardless of any contracts signed with
publishers.



24.       Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of
flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

YES – Please explain why

The existing exceptions are rigidly defined and too prescriptive. A greater degree of flexibility is needed in
order to effectively respond to technological change in contrast to often outdated legislation.



25.       If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national
courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility,
e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what
would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on
the functioning of the Internal Market.

A fair use provision similar to the US model would create built-in flexibility and allow for changes in technology
but still enable the law to protect the legitimate interests of rightsholders.



26.      Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?

YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to

As mentioned in Q.21, there is a desperate need for consistency across the EU in terms of exceptions. The
current territoriality of exceptions restricts our ability to provide equal access to resources for all our staff and
students. A useful example of this is how we currently provide access to broadcasts. The Educational Recording
Agency’s Plus Licence only allows us to provide access to students based in the UK. We are not permitted to
provide streaming access via authentication to non-UK based students. Such problems could be resolved if all
EU Member States had to implement all the exceptions as a mandatory minimum norm.



28.      (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other subject matter in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by libraries,
educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?

YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

                                                         4
The best example we have is the archive of Delia Derbyshire
(http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/derbyshire/)

It includes 267 tapes of music, principally on 10.5" reels, which relate to Derbyshire's work as a composer of
electronic music during the 1960s and 70s. David Butler, an academic in Drama and Screen Studies, transferred
the tapes to digital media, for preservation and access purposes, and he worked closely with the Derbyshire
estate to obtain their permission. The audio recordings are the subject of very tight copyright restrictions. Had
permission not been forthcoming we would not have been able to achieve the transfer. It is likely that in a few
years the reels will deteriorate beyond the point of retrieval, through physical deterioration of the tape
substrate, and degradation of the magnetic coating.

The copying for preservation purposes of magnetic and digital media is essential, and should be treated quite
separately from access issues.


29.      If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Preservation of all formats including sound and film as well as format-shifting should be covered by the
preservation exception. This exception should also be flexible enough to respond to changing technology. As
the records of our social and cultural lives become increasingly digital, it is vital we are able to preserve these
for longevity.



40.       [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass digitisation
projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to
enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between
libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed
across the EU?

YES – Please explain

The 2011 Memorandum of Understanding is too limited to be of any assistance to cultural heritage
organisations wishing to undertake mass digitisation of copyright works. A Memorandum of Understanding
cannot be enforced and is not the appropriate vehicle for setting mandatory minimum norms across the EU, as
demonstrated by the fact that only two countries have acted on it to date. Additionally, no Memorandum of
Understanding will ever be of any use for archives, since there are no collecting societies for the bulk of
archival materials (e.g. unpublished literary works, documentary photographs, and oral sound recordings).



41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other types of
content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

YES – Please explain

We need exceptions that combine the mandatory minimum norms alongside extended collective licensing
schemes. Much material (including orphan works) held in cultural heritage organisations such as libraries and
archives were never commercially produced. This includes a large quantity of audio-visual material where
performers involved never had a commercial purpose in mind.



 42.      (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for illustration for teaching, including
across borders?

YES – Please explain



                                                         5
Online teaching is now common practice within our institution, even traditional face-to-face lectures are now
podcasted/lecture captured and then embedded into our Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). Unfortunately
due to current copyright restrictions, it is not possible to deliver the same broad range of content to our
students regardless of the method of teaching. Our ‘fair dealing’ exceptions are outdated and do not apply to
the digital environment and online classroom. This is then compounded when students are based outside of
the UK. Enabling the critical reuse of materials for teaching and learning through the support of legislation
would help support academics and enhance the overall student experience.



43.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

We require a mandatory minimum norm across the EU for the use of any copyright material for illustration in
teaching, which cannot be overridden by contract. This would help academic staff improve their teaching
materials and provide a consistent and rich experience for our students.



44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration for
teaching purposes? How successful are they?

Materials are available either via subscription or via free licences such as the Creative Commons. However, the
material required may not always be available/suitable by these means or alternatively too expensive to
purchase. There should be a mandatory exception allowing teaching staff to provide students with the best
resources and information available as long as it is for educational purposes.



45.       If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what conditions?

Copyright exceptions for instruction should be mandatory across the EU and not be overridden by contracts or
technical protection measures. They should include online teaching as well as traditional face-to-face methods.



47.       (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the context of research
projects/activities, including across borders?

YES – Please explain

Researchers within our institution are regularly prevented from using works due to the current restrictions of
copyright law. The capture of information has increasingly become more varied and copyright law needs to
reflect this to allow students and academics a greater degree of flexibility when putting together their
research.



48.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

The promotion and implementation of open access principles would help solve the problems of prohibitive
licensing fees. There is a global trend towards making research outputs available to all without charge, and we
strongly support this trend. We welcome the requirement laid out in Horizon 2020 that all related publications
be made available in a repository.

49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for research
purposes? How successful are they?

In the UK the ‘fair dealing’ exception for the purposes of non-commercial research and private study currently
does not include audio-visual materials. However, legislative changes are expected to come into force in April
2014 to extend this defence to all types of copyright work. These changes will be extremely useful for our
researchers.

Improved licensing for the purposes of study and research would also greatly benefit our researchers. We
currently pay a large proportion of our Library budget towards subscriptions for electronic resources, and
there are still significant restrictions on the ways our researchers can use the materials available to them.

Since the publication of the Finch Report in 2012, the UK funding councils have provided funds to ensure that
the research they finance can be made available as Open Access, using either the Green or the Gold route.
The success first year of this new approach is yet to be measured, but it seems clear that Open Access as a
concept is more widely known about as a result.



50.       (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing persons with
disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content, including across borders, arising
from Member States’ implementation of this exception?

(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:] Have you
experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in special formats across the EU?

YES – Please explain by giving examples

The formats in which we are able to access our subscribed electronic resources are often not accessible for
staff and students with disabilities. This is often due to Technical Protection Measures (TPMs) in the works
which do not always work with software that the person with disabilities has available to them. The EU should
permit the breaking of TPMs in certain circumstances in order to provide equal access to resources to all our
students and staff. This would bring the law up to date with the digital age, as making copies from print is
already possible.



51.      If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

EU copyright legislation should ensure all content is equally accessible for all our students and staff in the most
suitable format needed.



53.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods, including across borders?

YES – Please explain

Using Text and Data Mining (TDM) will increase the progress of science exponentially. It has the potential to
facilitate the discovery of cures for diseases such as cancer and Parkinson’s. It has already been used to
discover how existing drugs can be used to treat other conditions. It will also act as a foundation for innovation
and new industry.

Researchers want to be able to mine content that we have already paid a significant fee for subscriptions to
read, as well as content that is available online. Licences and terms and conditions often vary significantly and
it is difficult to create a coherent data set. Data mining covers the extraction of facts and data which may not
be protected by copyright but may be protected by database rights; this is also an obstacle to our researchers
when trying to data mine.


                                                        7
Research libraries are investing heavily in preserving born-digital content, digitising cultural heritage and in
facilitating data sharing. Libraries are campaigning for freedom to apply TDM to this data because they know
that doing so will maximise the return on investment of public money. A copyright exception for TDM will
enable libraries and their users to contribute greatly to an innovative and competitive Europe.

The following blog article discusses the importance of TDM to research carried out by Douglas Kell, a Professor
of Bioanalytical Science here at Manchester, and CEO of one of our research councils. Casey Bergman from the
Faculty of Life Sciences here at the University has written extensively about text mining. This article in Nature
provides another useful reference.



54.      If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

A copyright exception for TDM for both commercial and non-commercial purposes would help advance
research. It would allow researchers to use TDM methods to speed the pace of their research and to make
new discoveries by analysing massive amounts of data with increasingly faster and more powerful
technologies.



55.       If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
activities should be covered and under what conditions?

A copyright exception for TDM for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, see Q.54. A legislative
solution is very much needed. This solution should allow data mining of any content to which you have legal
access. Countries like the United States and Japan allow text and data mining in their law.



56.      If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

A copyright exception would be the only viable solution to this issue.



76.     In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of
intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain
name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what
measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

It is vital that any legislation dealing with intermediaries is very clearly drafted to ensure organisations such as
a university do not become defined in the same way as internet service providers.



80.      Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please
explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.

As discussed above, we require clear exceptions for teaching, research and text and data mining as these
would greatly enhance the work of the University’s staff and students. It is also vital that these and all existing
copyright exceptions are protected from override by contract. Such protection already exists in Irish,
Portuguese and Belgian copyright law, and in upcoming proposals to change UK law. It is therefore essential
that across Europe, people know that as a bare minimum they can apply the norms of copyright exceptions to
lawfully accessible content.
