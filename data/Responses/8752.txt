1
  The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that must
be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member State in
which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many Member
States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with
regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
2
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.
