            I.Introduction

A.Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.

In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" 1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.

As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider

context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy" 6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

             I.Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere
in Europe?

D.[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services 11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.
10  Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term 15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

     1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
        trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in
        which you live?

 or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
 borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples

   E.Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
   authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

1. [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
   The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
   environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC 16 on the harmonisation of certain
   aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
   field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
   software17 and databases18.

   Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
   are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
   16 Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
   certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
   17 Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection

   of computer programs.
   18 Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of

   databases.
   19 Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,

   respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is referred
   to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
   matter”.
                                                                                                                   11
   protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
   networks.

   The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
   authorise or prohibit the making of copies 20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
   e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
   at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
   communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
   dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
   transmissions and both need to be cleared.

2. The act of “making available”

   Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
   upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
   “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
   territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
   need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
   only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
   countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
   Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
   a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
   (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
   service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
   country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
   a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.

        8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
           content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

     YES
     NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
    required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
    approach23)
     And again, it is a way to let the field in its own way. Enterprises think one thing, people, an
    other. Everyone is right and it is adjusted according the strength of the stream of the
    moment... If I whistle a music, do I or not, bypass the law? If I give a part of my bread, do Y
   20
      The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
   in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
   a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
   21 The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise

   or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
   22 See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and

   related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
   Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
   however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
   23 The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that

   must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
   State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
   Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
   with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning

3. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

   Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
   law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
   transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
   licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
   persons/entities.

            two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g.
            a download) create problems for you?

4. Linking and browsing

   Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
   They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
   pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
   a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
   public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
   A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
   works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
   memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU 26 as to whether such
   copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
   provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

        11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
            protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
            subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

     YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under

     When I say something, someone listening me can without any problem reuse wht did I tell
    for his own reasons. Why, because it is informatic manner would it be different? I repeat, a
    creator, and the society, have to fid a way to pay for a creation, but that done noone has to
    pay again, it is crazy! Look at the Van Gogh creation, he is one of the most well- known
    painter of the time. And he is the only one who never be paid for his creation. And now

5. Download to own digital content

   Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
   Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
   (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
   distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
   article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
   distribution of that tangible article) 27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
   also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
   (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 28. This raises difficult questions,
   notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
   keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
   the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
   a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
   second-hand market for physical goods).

          13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
              trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

     In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
   hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
   period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
   exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
   case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
   emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
   exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
                                                                                                                     15

F.Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need to
be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

     15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification
         and licensing of works and other subject matter?

  YES Why not? There will be only a proof that you participate to the evolution Humanity,
 doe not mean that you have to be paid all the time for that!

  NO

  NO OPINION



     16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

 [Open question]

  Everyone will know that Humanity advance in the way of evolution not with enterprise but
 with humans!



     17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

 [Open question]

   That our little babies of entertainment entreprise boss scream that this a proof that belongs
 to them!

   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
                                                                                                             16
     18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

 [Open question]

 The first time registred is the proof of the origin.

G.How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database 32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub 34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

     19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
         content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
         ownership and permissions databases?

 [Open question]

 The Eu has to show that it makes a difference between creation from mind to mind and
 creation from mind to human need to survive...

H.Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).


31 E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

         environment?

             I.Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.

Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
36 Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
37 Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of the

TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers and
Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
38 Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member

States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
39 With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database

Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
                                                                                                                18
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.

In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.

The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

     21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
         provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

  Too complicated and gives the sign that “ok, we do not want to show you that we disagree,
 but...” EU has to show it EU! Reject completely the way of the copyrights done elsewhere
 ans decides by itself: this is our law!

   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.
                                                                                                           19

   24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
       degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and

YES – Please explain why

       or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would
       be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its

 limit of the demcratic idea of sharing. Eu would have one of the best deal to change the
 vision of everyone.
      26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
          a problem?
 YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to

   because it shows clearly that limitations are not logical. Everyone is hiding behind his
 finger. And every states arrange the rules according what it thinks it can be accetable for

      27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
          have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be
          addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays
          whom, where?)
  Explained before, only the creatot has to be paid because what he has done belongs to
 humanity not to enterprise.

Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving

      The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
      cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
      works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
      works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
      laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
      from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
      types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
      of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
      new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
      content) is often uncertain.

          28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
              problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works
              or other subject matter in your collection?

              under which conditions?
       The only law, base on the “declaration des droits de l'homme” is that there is no possibility
       to restrain the access to culture and education. The reminding of this basic law will be

1. Off-premises access to library collections
   Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
   matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
   premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
   consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
   the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
   between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
   should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
   collections.
        32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
           problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you
           to provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts
           thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
    (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
    problems when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-
    matter held in the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries
    when you are not on the premises of the institutions in question?
      Yes I am obliged to bypass the laws that is not fair. I want to read, to watch, to listen
    something, it a right not something I have to pay for.

    (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
    institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including
    across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of
    research and private study?

      At the moment, creation is looked like belonging to all the Humanity, all the instutions
    have to increase, according their field, the opportunity to give access to everything, this is
    an obligation, not an arrangement.

2. E – lending
   Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
   also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
   technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
   such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
   need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
   various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
   business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
   to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
       36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
          when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending),
          including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
    (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
    problems when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending),
    including across borders, from institutions such as public libraries?


      No except this one, I have access and it will not give any lost to the library if I keep it?
    This has to be an enrichment. Remember before, how many times you dream to keep with
    you a book readed, but it was a concrete object, and it was not fair to keep it according that
    everyone has to access it! Why, now it is possible, will I have to keep the prehistoric rules
    when we are in a technological time?
    (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
    to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?

3. Mass digitisation
   The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
   libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
   an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
   Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
   whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
   EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
   digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
   found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
   efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
   and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
   authors and publishers on the other 44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
   projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
   currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
   available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
   Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
   publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
   effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
   a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

        40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in
            mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:]
            Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the
            results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and
   44        You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
   http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
   45 France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°

   2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
   collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
   (Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
   vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
   whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.
                                                                                                                25

  The problem, at this step of my consultation, is that I feel to repeat all the time the same
 fact. Human creation for mind belongs to humanity! The past step that we needed enterprise
 to give access to these is done. Now w have to find an other tool to pay the creator and only

I.Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

J.Research

K.Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

L.Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics 51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe” 52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

     53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have
         you experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data
         mining methods, including across borders?
          Yes, an d again we have to front the hypocrisis of the system...How can we imagine
         when I am doing a research that I have to pay to participate to the evolution of
         Humanity? How I can pay to give profit to the others?
 (b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
 copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including
 across borders?

M.User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

     58. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced
         problems when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to
         disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?

           My son learns to create videos and do little film using other part of film that he
         uploads on Youtube. But this Google enterprise has decided, few times ago to forbid
         this way of work. How can we be so limited in mind, creation is built on creation!
         When Serge gainsbourg wrote a new “Marseillaise” He used the song an dthe music
         of reggae and it gaves something new. And it is the first example coming in my
         mind.
         The problem, again, is to think that creation is something like a car! And even, I can
         lend, give, burn my car, I cannot do anything of this with something I have access!

 (b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when
 users publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-
 matter through your service, including across borders?
53
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

             III.Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

        21. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
            the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?

            (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have
            copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new
            business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
 The real work that we have to do is to think a salary grail for payment of creation. After it is
 done. The levies are one option to create a centralised money to pay the creators. There are
 full of other ways.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

        25. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
            undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to
            the free movement of goods or services?

        26. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
            persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those
            transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you
            provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
   If we keep the system like it is, yes this is a trick to ask to pay a levy for a external =hard
 drive to backup my work on my computer. But everyone has to be Honest, am I sure that
 there is many people never putting on his external hard drive a file with copyright? If an
 external hard drive is sold with a levy, this one has to be to pay everyone in the Humanity
 who creates something, and everyone can create something!


        27. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To
            what extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
            existing in some Member States help to remedy the situation?
 This is a wrong fight!

                I.Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 63. This is an
62   See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
63
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.
                                                                                                37
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

     21. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
         combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration
         for the exploitation of your works and performances?
 The producer, the enterprise to provide support for my creation belongs to a time which is
 disappearing. We can try to preserve it waiting that them wil find the solution to earn money
 by the way we can decide now. Only the creators have to be paid. The others are belonging
 to the past and have to be paid with the reminding of their existence!

     22. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
         contracts)?
  YES – Please explain

 the contract between an idea and a producer has to be done by the creator not the producer!

 gve!

            I.Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
64 Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
65 You will find more information on the following website:

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
                                                                                                      38
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of the
safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

     21. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
         infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
  YES – Please explain

 Creation has nothing to see with a commercial purpose, or we think that the Humanity can
 be sold!

     22. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
         involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising
         brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
         online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures
         would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
 The right has to be this one. There is a creator who creates something. He can ask to help,
 and according what he can hope to be paid, he can ask help. But never the payment of his
 creation would be different and the contract he will write for the help has to be built only
 with the idea of exactly the amount he will be rewearded. Never, the number of
 intermediary will increase the price of his creation...


     23. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
         achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such
         as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain

 ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 ……………………………………………………………………………………………….
66 For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
67 This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by

Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.
                                                                                                           39
 NO – Please explain

 According the fact that to share creation, which is the right way of any creation, is watched
like a bypass of the law, it seems to this system that anyone suspected of this looses his
rights and loose the protection of his private life of personal data. So yes, there is a balance.
But it is a crap one. Because creation has to help the Humanity to become better and it is
only possible if creation is shared. And noone will have reason to enter in personal life and
personal datas. A sharing aof reation is an human obligation and has nothing to see with the
cyber- criminality!

              I.A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

    21. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as
        a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to
        copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
YES only if the Eu level is to defend creation and its meaning for Humanity and not to
defend earning of money!

 NO

 NO OPINION



    22. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
        current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a
        longer term project?
 Depending of the ability of EU members to have the eyes in good position!

           I.Other issues

matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

  I hope by conclusion, that one day, someone in an institution like EU will realize the
wrong way wher we are. Creation has a history, and the commercial enterprises try to push
everyone to forget it. Humanity is elder than three hundred years. And copyright, created by
a French was only to empeche someone to earn money with the creation of someone else. At
this moment, there were only books to protect. The time passed, other support of artistic
creation were created. There were new, there was a need of money to authorize everyone to
get access on it. It was logical, at this time, that they ask to be protected. Now, the time is
changing, internet, new technology, give to everyone the possibility to create. But the
enterprises, old and coming from the history, does not want to disappear and claws to keep a
position they have not now. It is sure that what I write will not arrive today. But, it is coming
by itself. It is normal. It is Humanity. Every organisation like EU has two options. To reform
existing laws to show they ask themeselves questions but, in reality, to show they have no
courage to make faster a step that will be make in the future, either to accept the
responsabilty to push the train to go faster and to pass directly from the present position to
the next.
 Sure, some enterprise will scream about murder. They are right. But it is not a murder from
an institution, it is the crime of evolution.
 You have to decide: no crime and no evolution, or end of something for evolution...
