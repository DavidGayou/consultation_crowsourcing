 INTRODUCTION
 !The Interactive Software Federation of Europe (‘ISFE’), was established in 1998 to
                                                       1
                                                        




represent the European video game industry, which is the fastest growing part of the
European creative sector. ISFE membership includes major international publishers
of interactive software, manufactures of video game consoles and national trade
associations throughout Europe which in turn represent hundreds of video game
publishers and developers. ISFE members produce and publish interactive
entertainment and educational software for use on personal computers, game
consoles, portable devices and mobile phones both online and offline throughout
Europe and the world.
!The video game industry has high annual growth rates and is a major provider of
employment in the high tech and creative sectors in Europe and is also a generator
of substantial tax revenues. Intellectual property (‘IP’) rights, and copyright in
particular, remain one of the most important drivers for innovation and investment in
information society services, technologies and content, and ISFE therefore welcomes
the launch of this Copyright Consultation process. We also endorse the European
Commission’s repeated recognition that a strong and balanced IP protection system
is a driving force for promoting innovation and improving competitiveness. IP rights
provide the market-based rewards that ensure that innovation and creation can
continue.
!ISFE wishes to point out that it considers the current European copyright regime
generally ‘fit for purpose’ and believes that the certainty and stability provided by the
acquis has laid the foundation for the many years of industry growth since the
introduction of the Copyright and subsequent directives from 2001 onwards.
!Our industry was arguably the first in the content sector to react effectively to the
emergence and widespread consumer adoption of digital content and transmission
by developing new business models and modes of distribution. Internet availability
has enabled ISFE members to develop a range of online services that deliver
interactive content to consumers in a variety of new ways under multiple pricing
models. The way in which the video game industry has delivered engaging
experiences to consumers has, as a result, evolved dramatically. Just 15 years ago,
industry products consisted primarily of console and PC games that were sold on
disc and played at home with limited opportunities for multiplayer interaction. Today,
however, online game delivery and game play are the norm, providing consumers

with additional channels for acquiring game content, and expanded options for
playing against and engaging with other gamers around the world.
!This submission will answer questions from the Copyright Consultation document
most applicable to the business activities of ISFE’s membership, answering individual
questions or condensing multiple questions where appropriate.
!11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
!YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or
 under specific circumstances, and why
 !Interconnectedness by linking is at the very heart of the Internet and is, indeed,
indispensable for it to function. The provision of a hyperlink to a copyright work
should, in our view, only be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder in very
specific circumstances. Where, for instance, the hyperlink connects directly with an
infringing or unauthorised copy of a work, we believe that the provider of the link
should indeed be regarded as communicating that copy to the public. This is
because, as a result of the hyperlink, the work will be communicated to a public that
has not at all been taken into account by the copyright holder, since he never
authorised its initial communication to the public. On the other hand, the provision of
hyperlink to an authorised copy of a work that is freely available on another website
should not be an act of communication to the public of that copy. Such a position, in
our view, does not put at risk the critically important role played by hyperlinks on the
Internet.
!The CJEU has repeatedly reiterated that the right of communication of a work to the
public should be interpreted broadly (as expressly stated in recital 23 in the preamble
to the Copyright Directive), and that its meaning and scope must be determined in
light of the objectives pursued by the Directive. The Court has also noted that the
principal objective of the Directive is to establish a high level of protection of authors,
allowing them to obtain an appropriate reward for the use of their works, including on
the occasion of communication to the public.
!In its recent judgment in Svensson v Retriever Sverige AB (Case C-466/12), the
Court has ruled that Article 3(1) of the Directive must be interpreted as meaning that
the provision on a website of clickable links to works freely available on another
website does not constitute an “act of communication to the public”, as referred to in
that provision. According to the Court, the position would be different in a situation
where the hyperlink permits users of the site on which that link appears to circumvent
restrictions put in place by the site on which the protected work appears in order to
restrict public access to that work to the latter site’s subscribers only, since in that
situation, the users would not have been taken into account as potential public by
the copyright holders when they authorised the initial communication.
!The position would, of course, also be different where the hyperlink directs users to a
protected work that has been communicated to the public without the copyright
holder's authorisation, i.e. infringing content. This is because, as we state above, the
work would be communicated by the hyperlink to a public that has never been taken
into account by the copyright holder.
!Sites that deliberately and systematically offer access to infringing content via the
provision of hyperlinks should not be able to claim that their activities are merely
passive and that they don't communicate such content to the public. The wholesale
use of such links to facilitate the downloading of pirated content by millions of users



2
                             Public Consultation on the Review of the EU Copyright Rules - ISFE Responses



worldwide has become an enormous problem for all of the content industries. Linking
sites feature one-click links to millions of infringing files that have been uploaded by
users, and that are stored on hosting sites or cyberlockers.
!These links are posted by users who are generally “members” of, or affiliated with,
the linking sites concerned. The video game industry finds several million illegal
game files on hosting sites every year and routinely sends electronic requests to the
administrators of these sites to take down the infringing material. Despite such
takedown efforts, infringing files on hosting sites are accountable for a significant
segment of illegal file downloads on the Internet. The industry finds tens of millions of
links to such infringing game files that are stored on cyberlockers.
!14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be
the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of
previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of
content) concerned.
![Open Question]
 !The video game industry is the fastest growing ‘content’ sector in Europe and is now
estimated to be worth approximately €14.5 billion2 annually. The existing legal regime
                                                              




applicable to the sale of digital content drives much needed demand for original
copies of digital products directly from authors, increasing competition in the market.
Furthermore, the industry is also the leading developer and provider of new business
models within the content sector. These models are based on, and in turn, help
sustain and develop Europe’s Digital Single Market by ensuring that consumers are
provided choice in how and when to play video games. The end result is that video
games are enjoyed across borders by millions of Europeans. The introduction of a
legal framework that would enable the resale of supposedly “used” digital game
content would put all of this at risk.
!Digital content, by its very nature, does not deteriorate. Any copy made from the
reproduction of a digital file is a “perfect” copy not subject to ordinary “wear and tear”
and thus standard devaluation. Further, it is extremely difficult for a company to be
certain that digital content a consumer wishes to “resell” or otherwise transfer has
been deleted from the consumer’s device, and not saved elsewhere in any form. This
creates a great risk for abuse because the very nature of a digital product means that
it can be perfectly replicated an infinite number of times at no additional cost.
!While technological solutions can be used to control access and further copying of
content, including games, these solutions are not foolproof, can be expensive, and
may not be appropriate or give the best consumer experience for every type of video
game. If the law was to mandate a right to resell or transfer digital content, the
possibility of unscrupulous consumers abusing this right to obtain free copies of
games and other content would be very real.
!Additionally, as the nature of game play moves from a traditionally offline single-
player experience to “games as a service”, a framework enabling resale would raise
complex questions and problems. More and more games are offering a robust online
experience, often involving multi-player capability, all of which require maintenance of
substantial back-end environments and customer support. Often, these online
services are free to the original purchaser of the game. A right of resale would require
a framework for dealing with those services and raise numerous questions. Could
services be transferred in like fashion? Who bears the cost of building the
infrastructure to maintain such a transfer? Are in-game achievements and points also

transferred? How do developers deal with the ongoing costs associated with those
services? Developers rely on data detailing the average amount of time an original
purchaser will spend playing and the cost of maintaining associated services for the
original player when planning budgets and forecasts.
!A digital right of resale could greatly diminish the number of original purchases and
the related revenue stream whilst also extending the potential use of those online
services, both in time and number of consumers. The inevitable result is that
developers will have to pass costs on to consumers by charging more for the original
software or for online services that currently come with the software at no charge.
!The video game industry has fully embraced the transition to digital delivery by
providing consumers with more products, through more channels with more choices
on access, price and engagement. This has happened under the current legal
framework. Introduction of a new framework that recognises a right of resale of
digital games could jeopardise this fast growing industry and also the benefits
consumers have gained from a flexible and wide variety of business models.
!15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
 identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?
 !No.
  !20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
   environment?
   !X YES – Please explain
    !The current term of protection has become the international norm, the ultimate
beneficiary of which is, in fact, the public domain itself. The current term of protection
provides for a suitable period of time during which right holders may reap the full
benefits of their works – this is of particular importance to emerging and specialist
authors and creators – while also promoting investments and securing returns. A
shorter term would not be in the EU’s economic interest and would undermine
investment in copyrighted works by the creative sectors.
!Fair Use and Exceptions
 Questions 24-25
 !The current system of exceptions and limitations is fit for purpose and provides much
needed certainty in the European legal and business framework that facilitates a
functional and stable single market, allowing this industry to prosper. We believe that
any changes in the current regime will result in uncertainty that undermines
the interests of creators pursuing remuneration for their work and also the
introduction of new and sustainable business models benefitting both businesses
and consumers.
!User Generated Content
 Questions 58-63
 !Our industry is based around interactivity and user generated content plays an
important role in the relationship between our member companies and the people
that play our members’ games. The existing user generated content structure works
well for us and we do not see a need for any changes or additions to be made.

Private Copying
Questions 64-65

As has been made apparent in several recent decisions by the European Court of
Justice including the Padawan decision (2010) the system of private copy levies is an
anachronism from a pre-digital age, imposing disproportionate compensation
schemes at odds with determining relevant value, usage and beneficiaries. Private
copy levies inhibit innovative market based remuneration options for rightsholders,
hampering and even making some innovative business models impossible and
others less viable and attractive.

Levies are unsuitable in today’s market where consumers may avail of and pay for
digital content and services directly from rights holders as digital distribution allows
numerous configurations of copying and use, all of which are included in the price the
consumer pays. If levies are to play a part in the short term they should be carefully
controlled especially in light of the fact they are at present imposed indiscriminately in
some countries on devices that are not even used for private copying.
!75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient
 for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 !YES
  !Any organisation representing rights holders whose intellectual property rights are
widely infringed must respond to this question in the affirmative. Civil enforcement
systems can always be made more efficient in dealing with copyright infringements
committed with a commercial purpose. That being said, we are not in favour of re-
opening the IPR Enforcement Directive, and believe that the aim of rendering the
system more efficient can best be attained via other means at this time. The
Consultation itself suggests one possible means, i.e. a clarification of the role of
intermediaries without affecting the liability regime established by the E-Commerce
Directive. We would indeed welcome such a clarification, provided of course that the
regime established by the E-Commerce Directive is left entirely intact. The co-
operation of intermediaries is essential to combat online piracy and efforts to
encourage such co-operation should be maintained and, indeed, renewed. However,
we do not believe that the liability exemptions in Articles 12 to 14 of the E-Commerce
Directive should be destabilised or re-balanced at this time, and we welcome the
clear statement in the Consultation document that any clarification of the role of
intermediaries should not affect the liability regime established by the Directive,
“which will remain unchanged”.
!The distinction between content creators and intermediaries is becoming less clear
today. Online games increasingly empower users to interact with game publishers’
servers and other users to build virtual worlds and share user-generated content.
Consequently, many game publishers are now also intermediaries for the purposes
of the E-Commerce Directive and of notice and takedown or notice and action
procedures. We are therefore very sensitive to the need for balance in the online
copyright ecosystem.
!Intellectual property protection and enforcement is, nevertheless, critical, not only to
the continuing viability of traditional distribution channels and platforms, but also to
the stability and success of new business models for content delivery. The video
game industry is rapidly evolving, with publishers actively pursuing a variety of
innovative approaches to creating and delivering interactive content to consumers
through different game-play experiences, across different platforms, and under
multiple pricing models.
!

Although this evolution will require ingenuity in creating rewarding consumer
experiences, it will also continue to rely on strong protection of the incredibly rich
original content created by the artists and developers at the heart of the game
industry. Strong intellectual property protection helps safeguard publishers’ ability to
distribute games online, to provide multi-player game play, to make available new
means of interactive game play, including through social networks, and to benefit
from new revenue streams, such as from advertising and micro-transactions.
!The video game industry does not support technology mandates that would require
the compulsory adoption or introduction of a specific technological solution into a
network as, among other things, such mandates tend to lack the flexibility necessary
to adapt to a rapidly changing technological landscape. The industry favours
industry-initiated technology solutions to the problem of online piracy, coupled with
incentives for ISPs to not only remove infringing hosted content, but also to forward
notices of infringement to subscribers engaged in transitory infringements on P2P
protocols, and, with appropriate procedural safeguards, to disable or terminate the
accounts of repeat infringers.
!IP enforcement is not a goal in itself but legitimate rights should be respected so that
the fruits of rights holders’ efforts are not purloined and exploited by those who have
invested neither talent, time or money in their creation – nor borne the risk of doing
so. The video game industry chooses enforcement actions as a last resort and in a
selectively small number of cases. Such actions, therefore, do not provide a scalable
solution to the full scope of the infringement problem that is faced today.
!The overarching challenge for society and for rights holders today is to find
meaningful and effective ways to ensure that a legitimate online market for creative
content continues to thrive for the benefit of consumers, creators and other relevant
businesses.
!Despite the marketplace efforts by all of the creative industries (and, in particular, by
our own industry) to meet consumer demand for digital services, many avenues
remain open that enable profiteering from such infringement thereby continuing to
harm our economies and our culture. These avenues will not be closed without the
commitment and support of all responsible players in the online ecosystem. Where
commercially reasonable measures can be taken to address predictable and
identifiable harms, we believe that those measures should be encouraged. As for
“bad actors” who cause massive harm or who profit from their direct involvement in
the online infringing supply chain, they should be held to account. We believe in the
value of a general obligation on Member States to curb online IP infringement
through specific and proportionate measures that are most appropriate to national
circumstances. Such an obligation, which should not be prescriptive in line with the
principle of subsidiarity, could be accompanied by an illustrative list of effective
measures against structurally infringing sites.
!Since an intermediary’s liability is not a pre-condition to the granting of an injunction,
it could be further clarified and explained by the Commission that the provisions on
injunctive relief in both the Copyright and Enforcement directives relate to patterns of
conduct or behaviour, in particular regarding sites predominantly based on
unauthorised dealing in content, and that such relief is not limited to actions related
to specific titles. Injunctions against intermediaries could also be made more effective
by strengthening cross-border cooperation (e.g. expedited procedures through
mutual recognition of national court decisions). By the same token, the relationship
between the Enforcement and E-Commerce Directives could be clarified (e.g. by
means of an interpretive Communication) to outline what is covered by the notion of
“intermediary”.
!

                        Public Consultation on the Review of the EU Copyright Rules - ISFE Responses



At the same time, it could be emphasised that intermediaries will continue to be
disqualified from the liability limitation if they engage in behaviour that induces
infringement or disregard clear facts or turn a blind eye to infringement that is taking
place on their services, thereby promoting a legitimate duty of care to act responsibly.
!It should be clear from the massive growth in the levels of piracy that damages
awards have not effectively dissuaded infringers from engaging in illegal activities. In
addition, or as an alternative, to actual damages, we believe that consideration
should be given to allowing courts in the Member States to award a sum based upon
a pre-established tariff, set at a figure sufficiently high to compensate the rights
holder and the public purse, and to act as a deterrent. Such pre-established
damages are particularly important where infringers have eliminated evidence,
making it virtually impossible to determine actual damages.
!As a final point, we would like to stress that the right of information in the
Enforcement Directive is a key provision in the fight against online piracy. However, it
is not available in some EU Member States, and is unduly restricted as to make it
ineffective in others. It should be clarified by the Commission that this right must be
available for civil proceedings, and that the disclosure of necessary information is not
precluded by data protection rules, provided due precautions are taken and that
disclosure is necessary and proportionate. We believe that it is vital that the
enforcement of IP rights online is not jeopardised by disproportionate use of data
protection provisions to protect those infringing copyright. As outlined by the
jurisprudence of the CJEU and the ECtHR, an equilibrium between fundamental
rights should be found and infringers of the law should not be allowed to hide behind
data protection laws so as to protect their illegal actions.
!Reducing the availability of infringing content online should be the shared goal of all
legitimate businesses that operate online, as well as of consumers, the EU and its
Member States. If the creative sector is thriving and producing compelling,
professionally produced content, Internet usage will increase, consumers will
embrace new services, more advertisements will be viewed, more searches will be
conducted, more consumers will have the opportunity to enjoy their favourite content
at affordable prices, and more jobs will be created and preserved in the EU. In short,
a robust legitimate digital marketplace will flourish.
!76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for
sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers,
advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.)
in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not,
what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
!We believe that the current legal framework is clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries, but that the Commission could nevertheless suggest
some concrete measures that intermediaries might take, such as maintaining and
enforcing repeat infringer policies and their own terms of service, or ensuring that
they verify their customers’ identities.
!The Commission could also convene discussions between all of the stakeholders
(ISPs, ad networks, payment providers, search engines, rights holders and others)
with a view to securing agreement on the best means to reduce support for infringing
websites and to curb online piracy in general. Practical, effective and proportionate
measures to address mass online infringement could be developed and implemented
through cross-industry cooperation and dialogue.
!!
 !

                       Public Consultation on the Review of the EU Copyright Rules - ISFE Responses



Internet intermediaries could agree, for instance, to maintain and enforce “repeat
infringer” policies as well as their own terms of service with their customers. Their
failure to do so in many cases undermines the value of such terms and oft-repeated
claims to value and respect IP rights.
!Traditional hosting providers (that host and connect websites to the Internet)
frequently fail to verify the identity of their customers and as a result often host
anonymous websites that have registered with false or insufficient identity details and
that pay through anonymising payment providers. Such hosting providers should be
required to verify their customers’ identities, which would enable rights holders to
hold the responsible persons liable. Such providers should also be required to
suspend services to customers who have registered with false or insufficient identity
details as soon as they become aware of such false registration.
!We realise and appreciate the considerable efforts and resources involved in
organising and facilitating such discussions. However, as the Memorandum of
Understanding on the Sale of Counterfeit Goods via the Internet demonstrates, such
efforts can result in worthwhile agreement if the parties to the discussions are willing
to compromise and to act responsibly. Any such agreement must, of course, be
practical and effective, and must respect privacy, due process, competition, free
speech, and must protect legitimate uses of the Internet.
!77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance
is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other
rights such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?
!NO
 !While the current civil enforcement framework is neutral, it does not (and, perhaps,
cannot) “ensure” that the right balance is achieved in practice between the right to
have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of private life
and protection of personal data. One only has to think here of those Member States
where overly restrictive interpretations of privacy and data protection laws have
rendered enforcement virtually impossible.
!The CJEU has held that, when adopting measures to protect copyright owners
against online infringement, national courts must strike a fair balance between the
protection of intellectual property rights guaranteed by Article 17(2) of the Charter
and the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such
measures, and in particular the rights safeguarded by the applicable Articles of the
Charter. So, short of actually seeking to pre-determine how national courts should
strike such a balance, there is really very little more that any of the EU institutions
can do to ensure that the balance is achieved in the Member States. They could,
however, take cognisance of how the balance is being struck across the EU and
could perhaps issue periodical reports on how Member States’ courts are complying
or otherwise with the obligations imposed on them.
!We would like to have assurances that the proposals contained in both the Data
Protection Regulation and the Directive on the protection of individuals with regard to
the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of
prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, will not in any
way prevent the effective implementation of IP enforcement measures. We also
believe that it would be helpful to get greater clarity as to whether IP addresses are,
without any other identifiers, personal data per se.

!78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a
means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to
copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
!A single EU Copyright Title would be a complex proposal and needs careful and
 long-term consideration.
