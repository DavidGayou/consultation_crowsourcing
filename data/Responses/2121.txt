     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" 1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework 23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now 4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions 5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy" 6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works" 7 and "Content Online" 8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law 9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management 10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services 11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe” 12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition 13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability 14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term 15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
□ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)

2.     [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
YES
1. Research libraries, which sometimes include national libraries, can and do supply
research articles across borders to individuals for their own non-commercial education
and research purposes. This is a very important part of the scholarly communication
cycle given that not every individual or individual library can purchase everything. If
the Information Society Directive had direct effect in the single market this activity
would clearly be lawful, however due to differences in member state implementation of
private copying / research exceptions whether this activity is lawful across borders or
not is currently unclear due to the differing nature of limitations and exceptions in the
European Union.
2.National libraries in particular are interested in digitising their in-copyright
collections where flexible and proportionate legal mechanisms exist to do this. Despite
this being a focus of much Commission activity including for example the i2010 Digital
Libraries Programme, “New Renaissance”, Commission Recommendations to Member
States 16 etc, we still only see a handful of countries that have laws in place to facilitate
mass digitisation. In addition to this, given that national library collections are very
often multinational in nature, and their communication to the public involves all
jurisdictions globally we think it important to develop legal mechanisms, to allow

crossborder legal access to the fruits of digital library projects and mass digitization
public private partnerships.
Whereas Extended Collective Licensing exists in law in the UK (primary legislation),
Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Czech Republic, its legal validity cross-borders
given the inclusion of non-members’ works could benefit from further legal clarification.
Different legal mechanisms are being introduced in France and Germany to facilitate
mass digitisation also, and the cross borders aspects of these laws would also benefit
from legal clarity as to their validity outside the originating country. Certainly there is
precedent for this principle within the Acquis Communautaire in form of the Orphan
Works Directive and the Satellite and Cable Directive.
3.Although not mass communication to the public, libraries in Europe are starting to
grapple with the immense technical, financial and resource implications of digital
preservation and sharing preserved collections with their users. We are aware for
example of discussions amongst the Baltic States of a single centralised digital
preservation digital infrastructure which would have to provide online access to
participants, and their users, cross-border. Digital preservation is in its infancy, and
provides modern day society with many challenges in regards to how to preserve digital
history for future generations. Given its immature nature combined with limited
budgets for digital preservation even amongst the larger member states, it is only
natural that countries like those in the Baltic region explore a shared international
preservation infrastructure.
Clearly one current challenge to the development of such preservation services are the
fragmented nature of EU copyright laws, and the lack of clarity around their
crossborder application. Even at a Member State level it is certainly common for
countries laws to not be fully “digitally compliant”. In addition to this we would raise
the issue that often the laws are crafted around one organisation preserving its own
collection. This is not feasible and does not reflect modern day digital preservation
practice where mirror servers / multiple copies of items need to be run, and different
aspects of the end to end digital preservation process will have to be carried out by
experts who may or may not even be in the same country.



3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]

4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
We believe that limitations and exceptions / laws relating to mass digitisation / extended
collective licensing need to have lawful crossborder effect.

there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?

the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?

services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
YES
See our answer at Question 4.



B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC 17 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this




17
  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

                                                                                                        10
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software 18 and databases 19.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders 20 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies 21, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission
– e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available –
and at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks 22. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public 23. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"

   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.

   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
22
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
23
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined

approach 24).

Cultural heritage institutions including libraries are increasingly asked to provide access
to cultural heritage across the entire EU. In the majority of cases works on the websites
of cultural heritage institutions are made available without territorial restrictions. There
is substantial uncertainty about liability issues when making works available to
audiences in all of Europe.

The “country of origin” approach may facilitate that content needs only to be licensed in
the country where the library is established. The same should be true for the issue of
liability for acts of communication to the public; only the law of the country of origin
applies, whether it concerns copyright law, but preferably also criminal law et cetera.



9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief 25)?
 YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights").

24
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
25
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                              12
In keeping with their public interest mission, libraries desire to provide both physical
and digital access to their information, but the latter involves acts of both reproduction
and making available. However, e.g. CMOs sometimes have a limited mandate so that
they can merely issue licences for the (digital) reproduction right but not for the right of
communication to the public. Moreover, the scope of this mandate may differ from
CMO member to CMO member, while potential licencees lack insight in these
differences.


3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU 26 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU 27 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
No, hyperlinking does not amount to a communication of the public within the meaning
of Article 3(1) of the InfoSoc Directive, see the opinion of the European Copyright
Society      on       the      CJEU        Case       C-466/12     (Svensson)     at
www.ivir.nl/news/European_Copyright_Society_Opinion_on_Svensson.pdf, and on
February 13 of this year the CJEU indeed ruled accordingly. Moreover, embedding does
not amount to a communication of the public for the same reason.




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
This is the case in general, based on the exception in Article 5(1) of the InfoSoc
Directive. Moreover, an analogue article should also be included in the Database
Directive and the Computer Programs Directive.


4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article) 28. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 29. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
29
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              14
C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute 30. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered 31.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 32, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such



30
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
31
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
32
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

                                                                                                             15
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database 33 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition 34 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub 35 is seeking to take such
identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated
licensing across different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention 36 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
From the perspective of libraries and cultural heritage institutions in the Netherlands
the current terms of copyright protection (including neighbouring rights protection) are
too long. Cultural heritage institutions hold large collections of works that are still under
copyright (or where the copyright status is unclear) but that are not exploited
commercially anymore. A term of protection of life plus 70 years stands in stark contrast
with the commercial life of the large majority of copyright protected works that much
shorter. As a result the disproportionate length of copyright protection prevents our

institutions from effectively fulfilling our public interest mission in the digital
environment.
In many cases the cost for digitisation of copyrighted works that are no longer in
commercial exploitation exceeds the potential economic value of these works. As a result
these are not made available online by the right holders or publishers who lack an
economic incentive. While cultural heritage institutions that own such works have an
incentive to make such works available (it is our public task to provide access to our
collections) they are confronted with costs for rights clearance that are prohibitively
high due to the required diligent searches for the right holder(s) of every work (often
heirs).
One of the outcomes of this is the existence of the so called ‘20th century black hole’
when it comes to online availability of copyrighted works. Works from the 20th century
are significantly less likely to be available than works from the centuries before (many of
which are clearly in the public domain) or from the 21st century (many of which are still
available commercially).
Shortening the term of protection will decrease the number of out-of-commerce works
that are in copyright and will thus reduce the scope of the problems outlined above.
Given this, the term of copyright protection should be reduced to the minimum
requirement established by the Berne Convention (life of the creator plus 50 years). This
could be a first step towards a more significant reduction of term of protection that
would require a revision of the Berne Convention; the European Union should work in
the relevant international fora to further reduce the term. This should include efforts to
agree on a system where extended copyright protection after an initial automatically
granted term would be only granted if the work is registered by the right holder. The
duration of the initial term should be brought into line with the duration of protection of
other IP rights such as patented inventions (20 years) databases (15 years) and
industrial design rights (25 years). Also compare the Lisbon Council Policy Brief by P.B.
Hugenholtz and I. Hargreaves:
www.ivir.nl/publications/hugenholtz/LisbonCouncil_policybrief.pdf.
In addition it should be examined if it is possible to establish a cut-off date for copyright
protection that ensures that all works published before that date are not protected by
copyright anymore. Such a cut-off date could vary by sector (European Film Heritage
institutions for example advocate 1920 as a cut-off date for cinematographic works).



 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC 37.




37
  Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

                                                                                                           17
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law 38. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations
and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a
normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 39, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional 40, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B") 41.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
41
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            18
YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
The purpose of Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of
copyright and related rights in the information society was explicitly (as its title shows)
to create more harmonisation within the EU. Ironically, it ends in a situation of non-
harmonisation. Limitations and exceptions vary a lot from country to country. Only one
exception is mandatory today: the exception for temporary copies (whether this
could/should be regarded as an act of reproduction was also discussed at WIPO in
1996).
In addition to this situation of non-harmonisation, the list of exceptions was made
exhaustive, so no exceptions could be adjusted or expanded to similar uses, and no new
exceptions could be added despite the fact that the world and the information market is
ever changing.
It is in the library’s missions to cooperate and share resources across borders. For the
European library community the existence of 28 different copyright regimes with their
own exceptions makes this cooperation more difficult. One example is that the definition
of “non-commercial” differs from country to country. For other differences see K.
Crews’ Study on Copyright Limitations and Exceptions for Libraries and Archives
written for WIPO at www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/sccr_17/sccr_17_2.pdf.
The current situation creates an uneven playing field. Users of the same type should be
able to enjoy the same exceptions (user rights) in all member states. Cultural Heritage
Institutions are increasingly working together on digitisation projects (for example in
the context Europeana) and the fact that the exceptions benefitting publicly accessible
libraries, museums and archives have not been implemented (uniformly) in all
member states, creates unnecessary uncertainties and disadvantages institutions in some
member states vis-a-vis institutions in others.
The 'New renaissance' report on bringing Europe’s cultural heritage online specifically
recommended such collaborations between institutions. The lack of harmonization
introduces unnecessary friction costs for institutions engaging in cross border
collaborations.
The lack of harmonisation and the optional character of the list of exceptions creates an
ambiguous situation throughout the EU. Especially when several Member States work
together in cross-border projects such as:
-     Europeana and all the related projects whose missions are to give online access to
European Cultural Heritage;
-      the European Library;
-     the EU arctic centre, whose mission is, among others to develop knowledge and
spread information on the region http://www.arcticcentre.org/InEnglish/ABOUT-
US/EU-Arctic-Information-Centre or,
-      the Upper Rhin University;
-       All other cross-border projects shared by several Member States trying to pool
resources to the benefit of their population and to develop mutual understanding and
reciprocal knowledge. All those structures work with libraries that are supposed to give
access to their collection (including digital ones), but can be forbidden to do so because
of different copyright regimes and absence of harmonised exceptions in the respective


                                                                                        19
Member States. In addition, this lack of harmonisation is even more of an obstacle when
projects involve non-EU states.
The transition to digital services enables libraries and cultural heritage institutions to
collaborate across borders and make their collections available across all of Europe and
this needs to be mirrored by harmonising the exceptions benefitting these institutions.
The most comprehensive way to address this issue would be to establish a unified EU
Copyright Title (compare our answer to Question 78).

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

All existing and additional exceptions for libraries museums and archives should be
made mandatory and non-overridable. They should be harmonised to the fullest extent
possible, after they have been broadened and new ones have been added in line with our
response here below. It is not acceptable that citizens in some Member States enjoy a
lesser level of access to the collections held by publicly funded libraries and cultural
heritage institutions simply because of an uneven implementation of exceptions from the
InfoSoc Directive. This issue becomes more pressing as more and more activities of these
institutions are taking place online. Moreover, a vitally important issue is that contracts
should not be able to override limitations and exceptions.

All the current exceptions in the InfoSoc Directive are drafted on the basis that they do
not interfere with the normal exploitation of the work and, therefore, do not
unreasonably prejudice right holders. This means that making them mandatory in all
Member States should have no negative effect on right holders, while in many cases this
will substantially benefit citizens and other public policy objectives such as access to
knowledge and culture or inclusive education. Moreover, the current exception for
libraries, archives and museums in Article 5.2(c) is quite open in the way that it allows
“specific acts of reproduction made by publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments or museums, or by archives, which are not for direct or indirect
economic or commercial advantage”, but it is an exception for the reproduction right
only, and it does not cover any other library activity that would be considered fair use in
a more flexible legislation. One example is that the transmission of single scanned
articles or other pieces of information (like one single scanned poem) to individual users
or other libraries, on request, is considered as communication to the public and
therefore needs to be licensed. In the analogue world this is covered by an exception in
most countries. This is a case that in our opinion clearly would pass the three step test,
as it is a specific case and do not harm the interests of the author.

Additionally, to address technological change that has already occurred, the revised
Directive should include new mandatory exceptions. Cultural heritage institutions need
to be enabled to make out-of-commerce works in their collections available online for
non-commercial purposes, by expanding the scope of the existing provision in Article
5(3)n of the Directive. Thus, a functional exception (unlike the one in the Orphan Works
Directive) should be created for mass digitisation and making available out-of-
commerce works by libraries, archives and museums for non-commercial purposes.
Moreover, new exceptions are desirable for text and data mining, for research and


                                                                                        20
education purposes, plus Open Access legislation. Finally, there is a need to introduce an
open norm.



23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
NO. All current existing exceptions must remain, while adding new ones (see our
response to Question 22) and/or finding a more flexible solution than the current one. To
list any new specific exceptions that will take into account any new technological
development in years to come would not prove to be useful. The current list should
therefore be combined with more general principles like an open norm.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
YES – Please explain why
There is indeed a need for more flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for
limitations and exceptions. The exceptions and limitations in the InfoSoc Directive were
not drafted in a technologically neutral manner which is problematic in times of
accelerated technological progress. We repeat the need for a more flexible and open
solution. Most exceptions are too narrow and specific, even for 2001 when they were
written. Also see the report of P.B. Hugenholtz and M.R.F. Senftleben, Fair Use in
Europe.     In   Search     of   Flexibilities.  IViR,   Amsterdam,       available   at
www.ivir.nl/publications/hugenholtz/Fair%20Use%20Report%20PUB.pdf.


25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
The best approach would be one that provides built-in flexibility in reaction to new
technological developments or new forms of use. An open norm fits this description. It
should be implemented EU-wide and in addition to targeted exceptions and limitations.
As long as an open norm is implemented EU wide, its effect on the functioning of the
single market would be minimal while it can be expected to improve the competitive
position of European market actors vis-a-is market participants in other jurisdictions
that have an open norm.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
See the examples given in our response to Question 2.
                                                                                            21
27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving 42 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions 43. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive 44.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

   Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.
44
   Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.

                                                                                            22
The Netherlands have implemented Article 5(2)c of the InfoSoc Directive as a narrow
preservation exception in the Dutch Copyright Act (article 16n). This exception sums up
three specific permitted acts of reproduction: restoration, preservation of works under
threat of decay, and format shifting in case software formats become inaccessible.
However, these narrowly defined acts of reproduction do not fully cover the needs of
libraries and other cultural heritage institutions in the digital environment. Firstly, they
wish to be able to digitize works for preventive purposes before they show signs of
decay, in case harm might be done to their collections (compare the Cologne archive
which collapsed into a metro tunnel). Libraries and other heritage institutions should
thus be allowed to digitize not only materials that ‘threaten to decay’, but their entire
collections to prevent any item from loss – regardless the present condition. As format
shifting is concerned, the Dutch exception is worded too restrictively, given that the
preservation of e.g. older computer games requires not just format shifting of the work
itself but also the format shifting and emulation of both the hardware and software
required to keep the work accessible.
Secondly, libraries also want to digitize works in their collections to be able to better
fulfil their missions. Digital copies of cultural heritage works provide many advantages
such as being (automatically) indexable, being easier to access and having lower storage
costs. The current Dutch implementation of Article 5(2)c of the InfoSoc Directive does
not allow institutions to structurally create digital copies of works in their collection.
This prevents institutions from fully realising the potential inherent to digitisation of
their collections. This is highly detrimental in an environment where, as the 'New
Renaissance' report puts it, “digitization is more than a technical option, it is a moral
obligation”. In addition recital 40 of the Directive which states that 'Such an exception
or limitation should not cover uses made in the context of online delivery of protected
works or other subject-matter' is highly problematic. As online communication of
works to the public becomes more and more important for cultural heritage
institutions, limiting the reproduction exception in such a way is simply anachronistic as
it prevents institutions from using digitized works in a meaningful way.
Thirdly, technological measures and their relationship with the exceptions benefitting
cultural heritage institutions are highly problematic: often CDs and DVDs are protected
by technological measures, the removal of which would require the cooperation of the
producer. Art. 6 of the Infosoc Directive provides that technological protection measures
are protected per se, independently on the scope of protection, entrusting to voluntary
agreements or to subsidiary interventions of Member States the adoption of appropriate
measures to ensure that legitimate users can make effective use of licensed content.
These measures are lacking in most Member States, to the detriment of libraries.
Fourthly, as indicated in our answer to Question 2 we believe that laws that allow digital
preservation networks between institutions and countries is something that should be
facilitated through copyright law.

                                                                                         23
30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
The best solution would be to broaden the existing exception in article 5(2)(c) of the
InfoSoc Directive, so that it allows cultural heritage institutions to make reproductions
of all works in their collection as long as these are made to achieve aims related to their
public-interest missions and not intended for direct commercial purposes. In line with
our answer to Question 22 this exception should be made mandatory for all Member
States.

As the 'Study on the application of Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights
in the information society' (page 301) highlights, […]to make an exception mandatory
could apply in the case of article 5(2)(c), as the development of digital libraries is one of
the key objectives of the Digital Agenda, and the digitization of cultural heritage is
promoted by the Council and the Commission […]. Instead of only allowing specific acts
of reproduction, it should allow all acts of reproduction necessary for publicly accessible
libraries, educational establishments or museums, or by archives to achieve aims related
to their public-interest missions. This should include reproductions for format shifting
and emulation, reproductions made as part of mass digitization efforts, and backup
copies. Such reproductions should be limited to use which is not for direct commercial
or economic advantage or use in line with other exceptions and limitations allowed for
by the Directive. Additional benefits would be increasing the operational efficiency and
reducing costs of the beneficiary institutions.

Moreover, Art. 6 of the InfoSoc Directive should be revised in order to enforce
exceptions and limitations and to ensure legitimate utilizations of protected works,
regardless of format or mode of dissemination.

The result of making mandatory both Art. 5(2)c and Art. 6 of the InfoSoc Directive is
that they would support the specific public mission and responsibility of libraries and
other cultural heritage institutions, that is different from most other users of
copyrighted material. Their main responsibility is to preserve, organise, make available,
and promote information and literature for the public interest. Short-term economic
interests should not limit long-term preservation of human’s cultural heritage.
Subscribed online content can escape libraries preservation schemes because of the
absence of specific exceptions, creating a huge risk of a 21st century black hole where a
large amount of content could disappear forever. Broadening the scope of the extension
along these lines mirrors the recommendations made as part of the European
Commission commissioned 'Study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC on
copyright and related rights in the information society' from December 2013.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?

institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries

                                                                                          25
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
YES – Please explain with specific examples
In the Netherlands, the licensing of e-books for lending purposes, especially recent
novels by public libraries, has proven to be difficult. The Dutch government
commissioned a report by the Amsterdam Institute for Information Law on whether the
lending exception in the Lending Right Directive applies to e-books. The conclusion that
it most probably does not is now being tested in court by the Association of Public
Libraries, whose purpose it is to protect the human right of access to (pluralist)
information, including in digital form. This Association refers to the UsedSoft decision
in aiming to have questions asked to the CJEU on this issue.

We as a national library also have experienced a reluctance from publishers to deposit
eBooks with us and make them available on our premises. With regard to e-lending
from the point of view of research libraries we would cross refer to the submission of
IFLA.

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other 45. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted) 46.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
 YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
Copyright issues related to the mass digitization of collections and subsequent making
available of digitized works require an approach that is broader than what can be
addressed with the 2011 MoU and the 2012 Orphan Works Directive. Diligent searches
are undoable for mass digitization projects as it would require too large investments in
both time and money. For instance, we calculated that for clearing 25.000 copyrighted
Dutch books from the 1920s at least 50.000 right holders should be tracked down. We
also calculated that in order to clear copyright in articles in digitized Dutch magazines


45
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
46
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             27
from the period 1900-1940 (1,5 million pages), we would need to search for 14.000
authors.
Enabling mass digitisation could better be done by introducing an exception for
libraries, museums and archives to make available out-of-commerce content resulting of
mass digitisation projects by an extension of Articles 5(2)c and 5(3)n of the InfoSoc
Directive. Alternatively, solutions such as Extended Collective Licensing exist that could
well be useful, as stated in the report available at:
www.ivir.nl/publicaties/guibault/ECL_Europeana_final_report092011.pdf. In the
Netherlands, cultural heritage institutions - including our library - together with Dutch
CMOs have asked the government to investigate the possibility of introducing a Dutch
legal basis for Extended Collective Licensing
(www.fobid.nl/sites/fobid/files/130910ECL_briefZonderHandtek_def.pdf).
A number of national libraries were involved in negotiating the MOU on Out of
Commerce Works. We certainly believe that legislation of this type that allows cross-
border use of the works digitised would be a vital step to allowing national libraries to
digitise their in-copyright collections, and for the public to access them.
We also can vouch that there is much interest amongst citizens, scholars, pupils,
teachers etc in the digitisation of 20th century works. The Bøkhylla Project currently
implemented by the National Library of Norway had, as of August 2010, 10.3 million
book pages visited and 69.4% of all titles available on the site accessed by users at some
point showing a real public interest. During 2012, as many as 51 million page views were
recorded through bokhylla.no with 259,000 unique users (5.2% of the population), with
46 pages opened per visit.




41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
YES – Please explain
This is certainly necessary. The public has a legitimate interest in having online
access to the collections of all publicly accessible libraries, museums and archives across
Europe (see article 27.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights). There is no good
reason for limiting mechanisms that create such access to certain types of content.
See also the recommendation made in the 'New Renaissance' report of the Commission
appointed 'Comite de Sages' that was published in 2011. The report recommended that
'solutions for orphan works and out of distribution works must cover all the different
sectors: audiovisual, text, visual arts, sound'.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC 47 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC 48 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC 49 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 50.

The Marrakesh Treaty51 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?
YES – Please explain by giving examples

As a national library our services should be on offer to all citizens on an equal footing –
able-bodied or not. The laws across the EU for the disabled vary from Member State to
Member State and depending on the country either achieve equal access to information
and      knowledge       for     those     with       disabilities,     or     do      not.
Please also see the submission of FOBID for more details on the Dutch situation.

51.    If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]

The swift ratification, implementation and application of the WIPO Marrakesh Treaty
by the EU and its Member States is needed to improve accessibility for persons with
visual impairments across the single market. Whereas Art.5(3)b of the Information
Society Directive is enabling, the issue is what has been enacted, or more pertinently not

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics 52 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe” 53. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that

  For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
YES – Please explain

The potential of text and data mining for scientific research is enormous, and has been
widely demonstrated (see JISC (2012), The value and benefits of text mining, at
www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/publications/reports/2012/value-text-mining.pdf), see
also key resources below. It is a process aimed to collect raw data (e.g. the occurrence of
words, figures etc. in a database), not creative expressions. Undertaking text and data
mining of content to which researchers have already lawful access should be considered
a legitimate utilization, and should not be subject to re-license. But there is not legal
certainty on this point, and most standard licences do not allow content mining. As a
consequence, in most cases researchers give up research, rather than addressing high
transaction cost, both direct (cost of re-licensing) and indirect (the time needed to
negotiate). For this, an exception should explicitly legitimate text and data mining on
content on which researchers have lawful access.

Since in most cases it is necessary to make a copy of the content in order for a machine
to extract facts and data for mining, the act of text and data mining is precluded under
copyright law in Europe. Because it prevents the copying of large portions of databases,
the Database Directive is also a legal barrier to text and data mining. Technical
protection measures (also protected under law), preventing the downloading of large
amounts of content, are also preventing the application of text and data mining
techniques. Although text and data mining is concerned with the extraction of facts and
data, the results of text and data mining research are currently being suppressed
because of a lack of legal clarity.

Even if content is openly available on the Web, without explicit permission indicating
otherwise, it is unclear if the copying of this content for the purpose of text and data
mining is legal. Content licensed under Open Access licences such as CC-BY-SA or CC-
BY-NC may be inadvertently preventing users from mining the content.

•      Text and data mining is concerned with the extraction of facts and data, which
are not covered by copyright

•      Text and data mining may infringe copyright because it is necessary to make
copies of content to convert it into machine readable format

F.     User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and

                                                                                           34
blogs 54. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions 55.

     IV.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying 56. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees 5758.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers 63 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 64. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

Directive 2004/48/EE 65 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text 66. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose 67. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure 68. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
We believe any legislation dealing with intermediaries on the Internet has to be
extremely well thought through and defined appropriately. There are many types of
internet intermediaries ranging from ISPs as mentioned here, through shops, hotels to
schools, libraries and universities. In the UK and New Zealand for example, poor
drafting of three strikes legislation meant that “public intermediaries” like schools,
libraries, local governments and universities were essentially defined as intermediaries
in the same way as internet service providers. We believe it very important that any
legislation dealing with intermediaries needs to be cognisant of the different types of

65
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
66
   You will find more information on the following website:

   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.

   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
YES
In line with our previous answers (see questions 21 and 22) any tool that would provide
more coherence into the EU copyright system would be very welcome. A single EU
copyright title could achieve a fully functioning single digital market and enable cross-
border effect. See the Wittem Group’s European Copyright Code, April 2010, available
at http://copyrightcode.eu/Wittem_European_copyright_code_21%20april%202010.pdf


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
