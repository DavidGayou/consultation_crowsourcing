     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore

complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
 YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright or
to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
For European game developers, the problems are especially connected with exploiting
European music in their games and a struggle to overcome language barriers.
European game developers would like to exploit rich European cultural heritage while
creating their games. This is the case also when it comes to European music. However, in
many cases the current licensing environment makes it impossible to use European music in
European games. Therefore European game developers often build their games based on non-
European licenses or, even worse, on non- European content. As a matter of fact, it is a rather
old industry standard in the games industry set by non-European publishers that in almost all
publishing agreements, the developer warrants that the composers he or she is using are not
members of a collection society.
Consequently, due to complex and territorial management of digital reproduction rights and
“making available” rights, contemporary European computer games rarely have access to
contemporary European music although on global markets both sides would benefit from

a single title) see section VII of this consultation document.

                                                                                                     8
closer co- operation. In the end, this situation is hindering the use of European content in
European interactive media. Thus EGDF strongly encourages the simplification of the
European music licensing system.
A similar development that took place in game industry is now taking place in music industry:
individual artists publish their music more and more by themselves without the help of huge
record companies. This offers music creators highly required flexibility to survive in digital
markets. In business to consumer (B2C) markets, it still is in the interest of the music creators
to maximize the monetization of their music. However, in business to business (B2B)
markets, in addition to revenue, a music creator has to take to account the possible increase in
the value of their IP. For example, a single track given for free for a game developer can lead
to a significant increase in the value of their brand and replace very expensive marketing
activities needed to gain the same publicity.
The Finnish collections society, Teosto, has already acknowledged the separation between
B2B and B2C markets by allowing direct deals between musicians and game developers for
their music. This has made the use of Finnish music much more accessible for Finnish game
developers. Before musicians and a game developer always had to consult very expensive IP
lawyers for their bilateral contracts in order to overcome legal barriers set by collection
societies. This made co-operation far too complex and bureaucratic.
Unfortunately, all collections societies in Europe are not as progressive as Teosto. Many
European collection societies demand up to 10% of the revenue for the sales (of games
encompassing music) to each territorial area while at the same time new American services,
like dms.fm, have emerged that offer global licenses with a smaller price and far less red tape.
Furthermore, the language barriers of online games stem from the fact that online worlds
support the propagation of English as a standard language of business and communication.
Cultural diversity should be fostered online by offering multilingual support, but linguistic
diversity comes down to a business decision most of the time.
Consequently, the languages pose a serious problem, as games have to be usually localized in
Europe (costly). Therefore, if territorial licensing systems are not abolished in the European
digital single market area, they should be restructured in a way, which would allow a
publisher to buy a license on a game for a certain language instead of certain territory. It
should be remembered that for many European languages are constantly growing global
markets (e.g. Portuguese, Spain and French). Thus multilingualism might be a great
opportunity for Europe.
The license system would need to be completely electronic and manageable by its users.
Major issues would be the cost for such licenses and what specific legal coverage the
licensing would cover. If it provided transparency over revenue streams the from point of
sales across the EU, this could be interesting for game developers.

4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
It is the obligation of the European Union to make the principles of free trade and free
circulation of goods and services as effective as possible within the member states. National
license models, which are tied to national legislation and market realities, can hinder this
considerably. This is not only true in traditional analogue media as TV or music but also for
digital games. Here the technical development needs to be particularly taken into
consideration.
The world-wide possibilities to do “global exploitation” of the games however do not
materialize in one dimension. A game developer can usually only handle his home territory
and some selected territories beyond that. It can be observed that multi- territorial clusters
emerge representing world regions, which are similar, but by no means identical to the IT
industry and align sometimes to technological/infrastructural and language barriers, but also
to a political context.
Thus, as digital markets are by their nature global, the only territorial licensing model that
might somehow work is “continental”, not smaller. Multi-territorial clusters include South
America (sometimes specifically Brazil), North America, Middle East, India, Russia, China,
Japan, Korea, Australia/New Zealand, Asia/Pacific (including all countries of the region
without the above mentioned). As these models are currently emerging, it is too early to see
fixed lines. However, it is still early enough to establish a common European approach. Single
license for European digital single market area could make a difference.
If this is not possible, a language based license system could be developed, which would
allow a publisher to buy a license on a game for a certain language instead of certain territory.
It should be remembered that for many European languages are constantly growing global
markets (e.g. Portuguese, Spain and French). Thus multilingualism is a great opportunity for
Europe.

there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the

content is not possible in certain European countries)?

 YES – Please explain by giving examples
After the first of January 2015, the VAT will be paid based on the location of the consumers,
not the location of the companies, in the European Single Market area. As the profit margins
are extremely small in online and mobile games relying in-game microtransactions (often a
single transaction can be less than one euro), game developers should be allowed to introduce
different pricing policies for different member states based on their VAT rate. Thus game
developers should also be allowed to use the GEO-IP address of the consumer to redirect him
or her on a page that provides the prices applied in the member state he or she is located to.

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
 YES – Please explain
A unitary EU copyright title should be introduced; it is the only way to create a real single
digital market for digital content in Europe. The mistakes made with a European trademark
law should not be repeated with a copyright law. Thus it is probably not sufficient to
introduce a parallel legal framework to national law. This would only lead to an even more
complex copyright system than the one now seriously hindering the development of digital
single markets in Europe.

Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
 YES

matter”.

(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
 YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
Video games are co-creations of a wide range of artistic talents. Musicians, composers,
graphic designers, game designers and script writers all co-operate to create a single game
uniting their artistic visions. Especially for co-creations of this kind, making available rights
can become (the level of protection varies significantly from one member state to another) a


23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

major barrier, as any of the contributing artists behind a specific part of a game can determine
how the complete game can be disseminated.
Specifically with big international productions with the budgets of tens of millions of euro,
the mere number of artists involved is huge, which makes controlling the making available
rights, varying from a member state to another, extremely challenging. More time passes from
the creation of the game, harder it is to reach all the contributors, which seriously hinders the
exploitation of the European digital cultural heritage. Therefore, the European commission
should introduce a clear time limit for making available rights as well as all other moral rights
or alternatively limit these rights to the first act of exploitation.

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific

public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
In general, proving hyperlinks should not be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
First of all, the link itself is clearly equivalent to proving an address to an art gallery. Just like
providing the address of the gallery is not protected under copyright, either should be the
website address.
The success of European games industry is partly based on building the strong communities
of consumers helping the game developer to market the game. Normally, communities of this
kind involve thousands of consumers, in some cases hundreds of thousands or even millions.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

27
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              15

 NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
In the markets of digital content, a clear distinction has to be made between fully
downloadable content that is clearly a product and content that is provided as a service from a
digital cloud.
When it comes to fully downloadable content, the digital markets are still at their early stage
and the business models vary significantly. On the other hand, especially in the mobile
markets the prices of games have been constantly decreasing. Consequently, as the price of a
game can be as low as 0,99 euro, rather than creating new markets for games, second-hand
markets would just create a platform where games are exchanged for free. As the profit
margins per game are already extremely small anyway, this would only make it even harder
for European game developers to create games in a sustainable way.
On the other hand, some publishing platform might want to build their business model on first
selling the games with a high price and then letting users to resell them with a lower prize. For
them, a business model based on second hand content might work. Thus instead of building a
legal framework, it should be left for the platform owners to decide, if they want to offer an
opportunity to resell the content or not.
When it comes to games that are streamed from a server to a consumer, they are closer to a
digital service than a traditional product. The extent the people are allowed to exchange
digital goods within this kind of multiplayer game is often an essential part of the gameplay
and therefore something that should be left for game developers to decide based on their
artistic vision. Thus any regulation on the resales of digital content should be strictly limited
on the content that does not require a server connection to work properly.



C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not




29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.

                                                                                                     16
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
 YES
 NO
 NO OPINION


16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
In the long run, this kind of system would help the exploitation of European digital cultural
heritage, as it would be easier to identify the right holders.
17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
EGDF is extremely worried about the unnecessary bureaucratic burden this kind of system
might create for European start-ups, if mandatory. The great economic potential of the global
digital markets germinates from the fact that the barriers of entry are extremely low.
Therefore, all regulatory actions bringing extra barriers and red tape should be avoided.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
All registers should operate purely on voluntary bases, as it is the best way to secure that they
do create new market entry barriers.



D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The

30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
The rights ownership and permissions databases will become obsolete at the very moment the
creative works they refer to are destroyed. As there are currently only a few
memory institutions storing online and mobile games or increasingly music and films
distributed only through online platforms, the Commission should first focus its efforts on
creating technologies that enable the long-term digital preservation of the content.
[Open question]

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
 YES – Please explain

 NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
Before music, text, photos and audiovisual content were distributed through different
mediums. Today, the same tablet computer can be used for listening music, reading books,
watching movies and playing games. In practice this means that the borders between those
forms of artistic expression are starting to blur and thus also the rights related them should be
harmonised. The music in a game should not have longer protection than the game itself. As

the rapid technological changes in games industry clearly demonstrates, the technological
mediums of digital markets change so quickly that providing access to games published today
will be a challenge only in twenty years. Therefore an extension is no longer necessary.
Furthermore, similar clear limitations should be introduced to the moral rights of the author,
in addition to economic rights.


 NO OPINION

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.

40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            19
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
At the moment, the first decades of European digital culture are quickly becoming the dark
ages of European digital cultural heritage. This does not necessary meant that content would
not have been stored in the archives. Quite often the content is stored in mediums that are not
developed for the long-term preservation and therefore they are slowly eroding.
Unfortunately, these mediums are often protected by patented copy prevention mechanisms
making it legally impossible to move the content to another mediums without a clear
exception in the national copyright law.

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
The current exemption allowing the long-term preservation of digital content should be
rewritten in a way that it clearly allows both copying and breaking the patented copy
prevention methods for long-term preservation purposes in memory institutions. Therefore the
Community Copy-Right Framework and European licenses should include a new exception
that allows cultural or legacy institutions such as national libraries, archives and museums to
perform the necessary steps for reproduction in order to preserve Multimedia Works running
on proprietary programs, through emulation or any other relevant technique. As a condition to
this exception, it could be envisaged that the institutions would only be allowed to do so when
such proprietary programs are no longer on the market or supported by the relevant
manufacturers or in danger to be so. The Commission should also find ways how national
libraries could tackle the restrictions of patented copyright protection solutions in order to
save those cultural objects for upcoming generations.

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national

   Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.

laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
 YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

existing copies of a game are lost when a game studio quits supporting. Therefore, at the
moment, the first decades of European digital culture are quickly becoming the dark ages of
European digital cultural heritage. This does not necessary meant that content would not have
been stored in the archives. Quite often the content is stored in mediums that are not
developed for the long-term preservation and therefore they are slowly eroding.
Unfortunately, these mediums are often protected by patented copy prevention mechanisms
making it legally impossible to move the content to another mediums without a clear
exception in the national copyright law.

30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
If we do not want the cultural heritage of Europe to disappear on the eve of the Digital Era,
libraries or museums should be eligible to emulate games so that they are able to keep the
digital heritage of Europe alive. When the copies are used only for research purposes and they


                                                                                           23
are not made publicly available, these bodies should be eligible to save games for future
generations although copyright owners would be against it.
As recommended by the study published as a result of KEEP project, co-funded by the
Commission, the copyright law has to be adapted to fit the Digital in in order to save our
digital cultural heritage for upcoming generations. Major legal obstacles still exist regarding
copyright protection, software re-use and recreation of computer environments based on
patented hardware. National libraries, archives and museums try to fulfil their task in offering
long-term access to authentic digital material, but they cannot violate the law.
Especially for those media types which are already obsolete or becoming so, a general
exception for cultural heritage institutions to transfer a digital media carrier for archival and
access purposes without any technical restrictions is urgently needed on both national and
European levels.
In the area of making emulation of software possible the EU only allows reproduction to carry
out decompilation (reverse engineering) for interoperability purposes provided that the
resulting program does not incorporate portions of the code that is the subject of
decompilation. Therefore the Community Copy-Right Framework and European licenses
should include a new exception. Such an exception should allow cultural or legacy institutions
such as national libraries, archives and museums to perform the necessary steps for
reproduction in order to preserve Multimedia Works running on proprietary programs,
through emulation or any other relevant technique. As a condition to this exception, it could
be envisaged that the institutions would only be allowed to do so when such proprietary
programs are no longer on the market or supported by the relevant manufacturers or in danger
to be so.
When it comes to making the emulation of hardware possible in spite of patents there is no
unified European framework governing patent protection that could be amended. As
European digital content developed on now obsolete digital platforms is quickly decaying.
The Commission should find ways how national libraries could tackle the restrictions of those
patents in order to save those cultural objects for upcoming generations.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to


                                                                                              24
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
In principle, memory institutions should be allowed to provide off-premises access to their
collections, if the copyright holders grant permissions for it.

providing off-premises access, is finding out who the copyright owners are, the orphan work
directive should be widened to cover all digital content, including games.

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.



                                                                                              25

when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?

4.     Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation

                                                                                                26
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             27
B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?

States level.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?

Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.




51
  For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

The User Generated Content (UGC) is currently one of the quickly developing areas of games
industry helping games developers to engage their gamers more closely in the development
process. However, allowing UGC in games also makes game developers intermediaries for
the violations of Intellectual Property Rights. E.g. a gamer can modify the look of his avatar
by placing trademarks she or he is wearing in real life to the outfit of her or his avatar.

   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

The User Generated Content (UGC) is currently one of the quickly developing areas of games
industry helping games developers to engage their gamers more closely in the development
process. However, allowing UGC in games also makes game developers intermediaries for
the violations of Intellectual Property Rights. E.g. a gamer can modify the look of his avatar
by placing trademarks she or he is wearing in real life to the outfit of her or his avatar.
As modern online games can have millions of users, developers have no longer any way to
control the creativity of their gamers completely. Expanding the responsibilities of
intermediaries beyond taking down infringements when they are pointed out for them may
lead to the creation of severe barriers of innovation in this area. Already European games
industry is struggling in global competition and these kinds of actions would give an
important competitive advantage to developers from competing market areas.
Consequently EGDF reminds that when the Commission is taking action to involve different
intermediaries more closely on prevention and termination of online infringements, also
games developers have to be included to the process. Furthermore, EGDF stresses that the
limitations on liability of Internet Service Providers as intermediaries are highly necessary
and should be expanded to other digital service and content providers.
At the opposite ends of the value chain, the content producers and the empowered end-users
need a reliable, an open, and a free end-to-end scenario. Non-discriminatory access and
treatment needs to be enforced and permanently secured in every link of the value chain and
this can only be guaranteed by a public sector.

 IV.           Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain



55
     Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                           35
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

 VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role



64
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
65
   You will find more information on the following website:

of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

EGDF has a long experience with piracy, as a representative of right holders, because it
affects significantly on games industry. Piracy has existed in the games industry as long as
computer games have existed and large damage has been done to the industry by it, especially
in the field of PC games, where games are copied freely. A successful copy protection is a one
that leads to a game being available online only after 3-4 weeks after its release, instead of 2
days. The actions taken have varied from physical copy protections on the disk to the use of
DRM for online distribution. The benefit of the console game space has been that piracy is
more difficult, mostly requiring hardware modifications to the console – and therefore making
it less feasible for the mass-market.

Now, online and cloud based mobile games have large advantages when it comes to fighting
against piracy. They can not be pirated as easily as traditional games and that shows that to a
certain degree new business models can be developed to go around the piratical problems of
the Digital Era. It is thus possible to imagine ways, which solve the problem on its own
without massive copyright or anti-piracy activities.




 NO OPINION

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?




As a representative of right holders, for EGDF the current framework is clear enough. Any
further action risks eroding the consumer trust in online privacy even more than now. This
would seriously damage the position of European companies in global markets.

The viral innovation process of the companies successfully operating in immaterial markets is
highly different from the ones that are still following the methods of industrial society. Above
all, this new innovation process is as open as possible. Constant and immediate feedback from

67
  This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                         40
different kinds of social networks (virtual forums, social network sites etc.) and the users of
new virtual services and content have a crucial role in cultivating ground braking innovations
to successfully virtual products. This is all based on trust that companies respect the privacy
of their consumers.

Consequently trust facilitates consumers’ access to a European single online market. The
public has to be able to trust in companies controlling personal data they submit. They also
have to be able to trust that they have what they have ordered, without at fear of losing the
money.

Therefore data Privacy is obviously a big concern for creative content online, particularly
considering the free information flow and the lack of awareness for data privacy. Privacy is
ensured only as far as technology protects it. It may be a concept to provide annual audits
and/or reports of the security of such systems providing comfort to public at large.

A few years ago network and Internet service providers had no systematic overview about
content in their network. Regulation did not allow a closer look. The separation between
network infrastructure and online content was the man made ‘Holy Grail’ of European
Internet regulation. But during the recent years the balance shifted from privacy to the right of
information laws: in the aftermath of the homeland security policies of the Western world and
the war on terrorism, providers started to install infrastructure to allow the systematic
scanning of content while being distributed. The next step seems to be the fight against piracy
in the name of stronger rights on information.

At the same time there are more and more concerns about Quality-of-Service. Quality- of-
Service will mainly be beneficial for large multinational companies, and SMEs and customers
will be the losers in this equation. A preferential distribution would probably be given to those
content providers who have a strategic interest in keeping their point of sale – privileges in the
digital age. For the producers, this is bad news as again not the best quality or concept is
decided upon, but the “preferential” distribution channel.

It will not sure if this actually happens. Quality-of-Service seen in a large scale could be a tool
for de-democratising the Internet. Regulating the Internet in this manner is like the creation
commercial television in the United States. In the end there will be few providers of content
with creators of content fighting to be seen. Creation of such an environment would be
counterproductive.

From the position of EGDF, the real problems of creative content online lie in the danger of
misunderstanding the transition problems of some media with the new chances of digital
distribution with an attempt to leverage their bottlenecks and strategic position from offline to
online, from retail markets to immaterial markets. This is a danger for creative content
innovation in Europe, radically different from retail media distribution.

Thus, there is a danger to the network neutrality, the basis of freedom and innovation in this
new frontier. The regulatory efforts face themselves constitutional and legal problems in the
member states, but much more they might lead to an abrupt ending of innovation in the sector.

ISP’s might misuse stronger rights on information and “hide” behind it to prioritize their
preferred content in order to recoup their investments on the network. As the network capacity
becomes more and more relevant, this risk is becoming more and more obvious.


                                                                                                41
Some ISP’s have already locked or reduced the use of strong online computer games for
capacity reasons. This can lead to a situation, where specific independent content producers
hold a discriminated position to those who are working directly for network operators. This
development can lead to a dangerous situation for European independent developers, when
the strongest media content companies see this as a change to strengthen their dominant
position in the media market. Therefore it is very important, that the non-discriminatory
character of networks stays as a main element of European Internet politics.

Thus easing up the network neutrality in the name of protecting the rights of property raises a
serious risk of dividing Europe based on national mobile and broadband networks, as network
providers would have a possibility to slow down access to the virtual services competing with
their own. Consequently this would also raise new boarders for the free movement of
innovative services and knowledge inside EU.

Therefore one of the most important questions of the future of the innovative business models
for content distribution in Europe is how to uphold a non-discriminatory system, which truly
allows competition among media without the discriminatory element through networks
themselves.

During recent years, the basis of innovation in a media sector in Europe has been the non-
discriminatory Internet. Before most of the distribution chains in media content were clearly
in the hands of overseas distribution giants. European content makers did not receive enough
to live and too much to die. The free Internet is and was a historical chance for European
content producers to overcome post-war distribution structures and to touch down directly to
consumers. For those, who were able to find users, this was usually also an economic success.
But the base of all this is the free and neutral Internet.

Network neutrality is a high value and should be strictly established without any exceptions,
not even in the name of the stronger right on information laws. This does not mean that policy
should be neutral to technology in general. It has to be seen as part of the rule that competition
should be kept alive on every level of the value chain. The network neutrality is also a cultural
value, as it allows in principle equal access to everybody to the distribution network of the
future for games.

Only a common effort of the whole value chain will be able to boost the European technology
in the next level. The content layer plays a relevant role in this context. At the very beginning
of the value chain users and creators are getting closer (but will never replace each other: the
content frame is usually provided by the professional and this frame is fulfilled by users).
Boosted by the Internet the content layer is becoming more enriched by technology.
Legislative actions should not hinder this kind of effort.

The integration of mobile operators, internet service providers (ISPs), telecom companies,
broadband technology companies, websites, online shops, online rights aggregators and social
networking platforms rises a serious risk of creation of oligopolies in the field of creative
content. The challenge is to let all players of the value chain participate in this significant
growth while content is still delivered non-discriminatory. Therefore efforts have to go
beyond the network environments of today, which are also relevant to content from the rest of
the world. A media landscape where the network neutrality is weakened is less innovative.

Consequently, all in all an important source for growth and innovation in this sector is the
clear regulatory differentiation between networks and media content. This means that services

                                                                                               42
based on access subscription should not be tied to a particular ISP. ISPs should always
provide equal access to all content in the Internet, as roads offer access in the real world.

In the end, when it comes to creative content online, network neutrality is the single most
important question of the free movement virtual goods, services and knowledge. The three
freedoms that form the base for the whole existence of the European single market. Thus the
stronger rights of information laws can in the end create the far greater fragmentation of the
internal market than the current disparities between member states.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 YES
 NO
 NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

The current European copyright environment is so complex that it seriously hinders the
development of digital single markets in Europe. Consequently, the minor adjustments in
national copyright law clearly do not go far enough and thus we need a comprehensive
European copyright code. The mistake made with the European trademark law should not be
repeated with a copyright law. It is probably not sufficient to follow the model set by the
trademark law introducing a parallel legal framework to national law. This would only lead to
an even more complex copyright system than the one now seriously hindering the
development of digital single markets in Europe.
