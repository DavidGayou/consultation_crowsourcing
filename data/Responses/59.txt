                               I. Introduction

A. Context of the consultation
Over the last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created, distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content - for
information,  education  or  entertainment   purposes   -   regardless   of
geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy
and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in  2014  on  whether  to
table legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical  industry-  led  solutions  through  the   stakeholder   dialogue
"Licences for  Europe"  on  issues  on  which  rapid  progress  was  deemed
necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[2]. The Commission
welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact that  two  groups  -
user-generated content and text and data mining - did not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of the  legislative
framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication on  Content  in  the
Digital Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to  improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement  while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the
October 2013 European Council Conclusions[3]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring  2014.
It is important to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings,  in
particular those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[4], the "Green Paper on the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[5] and "Content Online"[6]. These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible  ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to  the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders' remuneration, particularly in the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,  distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way to
proceed. The "Green Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed  into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

             II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
   anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights - e.g. writers, singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead, they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is  limited  to
the territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet - e.g.  by
a music streaming service, or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  -  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence,
such that content services can be provided in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights  Management10  should  significantly  facilitate  the  delivery   of
multiterritorial licences in  musical  works  for  online  services11;  the
structured stakeholder dialogue  "Licences  for  Europe"12  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them  when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives
of the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the further  development  of  cross-
border portability14.
Despite progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to, services. These problems are most  obvious  to
consumers wanting to access services that  are  made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all online  services  are
available in all Member States and consumers face problems when  trying  to
access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the  "same"
service is available in all Member  States,  consumers  cannot  access  the
service across borders (they can only access their "national" service,  and
if they try to access the "same" service in another Member State  they  are
redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

htt.p://ec.e^iropa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-
europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf


 This situation may in part stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
 difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing  of   rights   in   different
 territories. Contractual clauses  in  licensing  agreements  between  right
 holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also
 be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

 The main issue at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
 (legislative or nonlegislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
 taken at EU  level  in  the  medium  term[7]to  increase  the  cross-border
 availability of content services in the Single Market,  while  ensuring  an
 adequate level of protection for right holders.

1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced  problems
 when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than  the
 one in which you live?

 YES. I was unable to buy some e-books from Germany and/or  the  UK.  I  was
 unable to watch some TV shows online that were broadcast either in  Austria
 or Germany.
2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have  you  faced  problems
 when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?

 YES. I publish technical writings under a Creative Commons  license.  I  do
 this in my spare time and don't intend to profit from it, but I would  like
 to make sure my writings stay free for other people to read and use. It  is
 unclear whether I must put a country-specific and/or a localised license on
 my works or whether a generic English license text will suffice.

3. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
 organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences?
 Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year  and  provide
 examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the  type  of  content
 concerned.

 N/A

 4.If you have identified problems in the answers to any  of  the  questions
 above — what would be the best way to tackle them?

 It seems to me that common European copyright law that applies uniformly in
 all member states would help with licensing. Additionally, it would greatly
 benefit  the  end  users  if  it  were  made  impossible  to  license  some
 copyrighted work for distribution in only part of the EU; it should be  all
 or nothing. Distributors/publishers should be required to  make  all  works
 they make available to residents of some EU member state available  to  all
 EU citizens, under the same conditions. There should be no second-class  EU
 citizens where dissemination of culture is concerned.

 As copyright  monopoly  holders  are  motivated  by  profit,  forgoing  the
 substantial market of the entire EU in order to avoid licensing a work  for
 distribution in a list of specific countries is unlikely to be  seen  as  a
 rational choice (especially considering that if the work is  not  available
 through legally licensed channels, people will acquire it via other means).

 5. [In particular if you are a right  holder  or  a  collective  management
 organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all  the
 necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still  find
 it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on  a  service
 provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain  content
 is not possible in certain European countries)?


NO. Additionally, I strongly believe such territorial  restrictions  should
be impossible to enforce.

6.  [In       particular  if  you  are  e.g.  a  broadcaster  or  a  service
provider:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all
the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you  would  still
find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on  the
service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect  the  consumer  to  a
different website than the one he is trying to access)?

NO.  Additionally,  I  believe  such  territorial  restrictions  should  be
impossible to enforce.

7. Do you think  that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) are needed at  EU  level  to  increase  the
cross-border availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?

YES. As explained in my reply to question 4 above, I  think  it  should  be
made impossible to legally limit the availability of copyrighted works on a
territorial basis within the EU. Attempts to  do  so  should  not  only  be
unenforceable but also banned, including DRM.  This  would  help  foster  a
common European cultural scene and be in line with  the  free  movement  of
people, goods and services.

B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to
   be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[8]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[9]
and databases[10].

Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[11] which are essential for the transmission of digital copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.

The most relevant rights for digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the  making  of  copies[12],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission - e.g. the uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available  -  and
at the users' end - e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy  of  a  work)
and the

communication to the public/making available  right,  i.e.  the  rights  to
authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the   works   in   digital
networks[13].  These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1. The act of "making available"
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload, the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where the  act  of  "making  available"
takes place. This does not raise questions if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of  "making
available" happen in the country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  "targeting"  of  a  certain  Member   State's
public[14]. According to this approach the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are "targeted"
by the online service provider. A service provider  "targets"  a  group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language  or  a  currency
specifically targeted at that group.

 8.Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations —
 i.e. when content is disseminated across borders — sufficiently clear?

 □ NO - Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of
 clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained
 above, as in "country of origin" approach[15])

 NO. I would like non-commercial sharing/copying of copyrighted material  by
 end users to be explicitly excluded from "making available". It  should  be
 impossible to prosecute individuals for sharing  files.  They  will  do  it
 whether it is illegal or not: criminalising this behaviour  just  leads  to
 unnecessary social  tension  and  creates  a  disconnect  between  everyday
 reality and what is legal. If people routinely engage in illegal behaviour,
 this erodes the authority of the law and undermines  its  rule.  We  should
 avoid criminalising things millions of people do every day.

 9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the
 territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the
 recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author
 or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not),
 on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
 availability of injunctive relief[16])?


NO

2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right and  the
making available right. This may complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the  two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.

10. [In particular if you are a service provider or a right  holder:]  Does
the application of two rights to a single act of economic  exploitation  in
the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

NO. Not for me personally; however, I believe the fact that this question
even arises points to the obsolescence of our current copyright system and
the concepts it is based on.
Perhaps it would be a better approach to concentrate on behaviours that
generate revenue from copyrighted works (and regulate these, regardless of
what specific acts are involved) and explicitly exonerate, de-criminalise
not-for-profit behaviours of end-users.

3. Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the
Internet to another. They are indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are pending  before  the  CJEU[17]  in
which the question has been raised whether the  provision  of  a  clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter  protected   under
copyright on the screen and in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[18] as to whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception  for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other  subject
matter protected under copyright,  either  in  general  or  under  specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

NO. To anyone with a technical background, this  is  absurd.  It  would  be
practically unenforceable and very easy to circumvent; the law  would  have
to be overbroad to cover even just the trivial circumventions.
Also, the person who creates a link to content on a 3rd party server has no
control over that content. At the time the link was created, it might  have
referenced an innocuous, free image; by a later time, the target  may  have
been replaced by a copyrighted  work  or  child  pornography,  without  the
creator of the link knowing.
Additionally, server software can and often does serve different content to
different clients, even for the same "link".


 Again, instead of focusing on a specific act (the placement of a  link),  I
 think it would be more reasonable to regulate, broadly, all behaviours that
 generate revenue by making use  of  copyrighted  works.  This  would  allow
 commercial websites that link to copyrighted content to be prosecuted while
 allowing individuals to share links without having to understand  copyright
 (much the same  way  they  can  cook  for  each  other  without  having  to
 understand food safety regulations).

 12. Should the viewing of a  web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
 reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on
 the screen and in the cache  memory  of  the  user's  computer,  either  in
 general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of
 the rightholder?

 NO. If a browser is able to access a web page and display it  (without  any
 form of authentication or access  control),  then  this  should  constitute
 implicit permission of the owner of  the  copyright  of  the  web  page  to
 perform all  steps  normally  associated  with  displaying  the  web  page,
 including the creation of temporary copies in cache memory or disk,  or  on
 proxy servers.

 It is the responsibility of the rightholder to try to frustrate attempts to
 display the web page without e.g. paying.

 However, under no circumstances should rightsholders be allowed to prohibit
 the creation of temporary copies of content in caches as this would  create
 disproportional technical problems.  Since  it's  hardly  conceivable  that
 people would pay extra to be allowed to cache something, the  rightsholders
 would not benefit from such legislation either.

 4. Download to own digital content

Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g.
 download to own). Questions arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
 dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling  them  or  by
 giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the  distribution
 right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when
 a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the  right  holder
 cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article)[19].  The
 issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in the
 case of an act of transmission equivalent in  its  effect  to  distribution
 (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)[20].  This  raises
 difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application of  such
 an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a  copy  of  a  work
 after they have "re-sold" it - this is often referred to  as  the  "forward
 and delete" question) as well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
 creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect  quality  that  never
 deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

 13. [In particular if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
 restrictions when
 trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3  file,  e-
 book)?


 YES. I own a number of computer games I bought on Steam™ that I cannot sell
 or give away (even though the DRM would be  capable  of  enforcing  such  a
 transaction). I own a DRM encumbered e-book that I may not be able to  sell
 or give away (I haven't tried). (I also can't use it,  because  it's  in  a
 format my reader doesn't support, and I can't convert  it  to  a  supported
 format because of the DRM. I could probably break the DRM, but  that  would
 be illegal. The vendor will neither refund my money nor furnish me  with  a
 copy I can use.)
 I think consumer protection laws should be strengthened to  prevent  abuses
 by copyright holders.

 14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service  provider:]  What
 would be the consequences ofproviding a legal framework enabling the resale
 ofpreviously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type  of
 content) concerned.

 Consumers would benefit by being able to purchase digital goods at a  lower
 price. Distributors may lose sales or be forced to reduce  prices  as  time
 passes because their fresh "original copies" would  have  to  compete  with
 used copies that are identical to originals. Market forces  would  tend  to
 drive down the prices  of  digital  goods  as  supply  increases  (as  both
 previously owned and new copies  would  compete  for  buyers).  This  would
 result in demand increasing as well: I expect more people would  buy  these
 digital goods at the lower prices that would establish themselves.

 Such cheaper and wider accessibility of culture would be a benefit  to  the
 public.
 New business models may make it more appealing to be  first  owners  and/or
 less appealing to sell what one bought; also, revenue channels not  related
 to  the  distribution  of  copies  may  become  apparent  or  increase   in
 importance.

 C. Registration of works and other subject matter - is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[21]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[22].

15. Would the creation of a registration system at  EU  level  help  in  the
 identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?
 Depending on specifics possibly with undesirable consequences that outweigh
 the benefits, but otherwise of course, yes.

16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

 It's conceivable that the authors of some copyrighted works are unknown,
 and therefore their works apparently cannot be legally distributed because
 no permission to do so can be obtained from them. If authors were forced
 (or just encouraged) to register, this would be

 less often the case. Professional authors (including the content industry)
 would register their copyright as a matter of course; this would
 fractionally increase their overhead costs.

17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

If unregistered works were considered to be in the public domain or
otherwise require no license for distribution or re-use in the creation of
derived works, then - for example - everyone's casually published holiday
photos could end up being used in advertising or as stock photos.

Companies would have little incentive to find the rightsholder and could
instead claim that a due-diligence search had failed, and since there was
no registered copyright, they could use the work freely (see e.g.
<http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/04/29/err_act_landgrab/>). The bar to
obtain copyright protection would be raised considerably to amateur
creators, resulting in an uneven playing field where commercial content
factories are at an even greater advantage.

If registration were not a prerequisite to obtaining protection, and an
unregistered work would enjoy the same protection as a registered one, then
the only readily apparent downside is an increase in red tape; however, I
have a hard time believing that lobby pressure from the content industry
could be resisted for long. Eventually, unregistered works would no longer
enjoy copyright protection, because that is what benefits the publishing
industry most.
See also my reply to question 80.
18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
Benefiting from copyright levies built into the retail prices  of  products
like data media.
Being able to stop corporations from using own amateur works for profit
without sharing that profit with the author.

D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held  by
producers, collective management organisations, and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,  internationally   agreed   'identifiers'.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31,  and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers and  databases.
The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide a single
source of information  on  the  ownership  and  control  of  musical  works
worldwide. The  Linked  Content  Coalition33  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a Rights
Reference Model (RRM) - a comprehensive data model for all types of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is  seeking  to  take  such
identification

31. E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used
to identify books.
32. You will find more information about this initiative on the following
website: http://www.globalrepertoiredat.abase.com/.
33. You will find more information about this initiative (funded in part by
the European Commission) on the following website:
www.linkedcontentcoalition.org.
34. You will find more information about this initiative  on  the  following
website: http://www.copyrighthub. co.uk/.
                                                                          14
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated
licensing across different sectors.

19. What should be the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption  of
identifiers in the content sector, and in  promoting  the  development  and
interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

I suppose it could be mandatory to label products with some established
content ID; like ISBN numbers on books.

E. Term of protection - is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with  the
applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention35 requires
a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author. The
EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of  the
author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

20. ^re the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in  the
digital environment?

NO. The point of granting exclusive rights (effectively, a monopoly,  which
we should normally oppose) to creative authors is not to  pander  to  their
financial interests. The sole purpose of copyright is to serve  the  public
good by furthering the creation and availability  of  creative  works.  Any
change to copyright law has to be evaluated not based on whether it  is  in
the interest of authors or publishers, but on whether it is in  the  public
interest. The public interest is twofold:
1. new works should be created in sufficient number and quality.
2. existing works should be available for consumption with few  restrictions
(including adaptation, private copying and so on).
It is these two  public  interests  that  have  to  be  balanced,  not  the
interests of authors/publishers vs. the interests of the end-users. While a
very long protection term  benefits  large  rightsholders,  it  is  dubious
whether it fosters the creation of new works, and even if so, whether  that
offsets the disadvantage of having to wait longer  for  existing  works  to
enter the public domain. Any publisher who claims it needs several  decades
of copyright protection in the future in order to publish now  should  have
to (but would be hard pressed to) plausibly justify this claim.
No extension of the copyright term must ever  be  retroactive,  because  it
cannot possibly induce past authors to create more works, and this would be
the only valid reason to extend copyright  terms.  Expectations  of  higher
profits are not valid  reasons  because  the  public  interest  (access  to
culture) is more important.

35 Berne Convention for the Protection  of  Literary  and  Artistic  Works,
http://www.wipo.int./treaties/en/ip/beme/.
                                                                          15

On  the  whole,  I  think  the  current  copyright  terms  should  be  made
considerably shorter, perhaps as short as 20 years from the date  of  first
publication (perhaps varying by medium and even genre; a 10-year  old  play
is still relatively recent, whereas a 10-year old pop song is an oldie  and
a 10-year old piece of software is probably nearing the end of  its  useful
life). 20 years would still be ample time for authors  to  make  money  but
would also benefit global culture by allowing the public domain to grow. It
is not necessary to be able to become fabulously rich from  art;  a  decent
living is sufficient.
Also see my reply to question 80.

            III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable  the  use
of  works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC[23].
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[24].   In   accordance   with   international
obligations, the EU acquis requires that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised  at
EU level)[25], these limitations and exceptions are often optional[26],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting  that
not all of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[27].


The cross-border effect of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders. In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are  used
for illustration in an online course given by an  university  in  a  Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of  that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member  States'  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain  uses   the
authorisation of rightholders is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,  and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

21. Are there problems arising from  the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for  the
Member States?

YES. For example in Hungary, songwriters can block parodies of their  songs
from being made, even when those parodies would lampoon not the  songwriter
but the  performer  associated  with  the  song  (not  that  I  think  this
distinction  is  relevant).  I  think  this  places  an   unnecessary   and
unreasonable limit on freedom of expression.

Parodies in particular should always be allowed, like under "fair  use"  in
the USA.

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be  made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

YES. I believe a system similar to the American "fair use" doctrine  should
be adopted and made mandatory EU-wide. In particular,  the  following  uses
should  never  constitute  sanctionable  infringements  (they   should   be
explicitly legal):

1. parody.

2. commentary/review (subject to reasonable limits of cited content).

3. citation/reference, where the original author is given due credit (again
subject to reasonable limits).

4. educational use.

5. use in political speech (subject to reasonable limits).

6. elimination of DRM for the purpose of performing an action that does not
violate copyright (for example, exercising a fair use right).

7. modification, adaptation or reverse engineering in the interest of cross-
platform compatibility or accessibility.

8. private copying (including Internet file sharing), provided that the
perpetrator doesn't make even an indirect monetary profit.
9. archival by public bodies, including the  removal  of  DRM  (which  might
otherwise hinder access to the work in the future).


10. the removal/circumvention of outdated DRM (where an otherwise legal
copy of a product no longer works due to some lapse at the vendor or
associated provider).

11. removal/circumvention of DRM from works that are in  the  public  domain
(e.g. because their copyright term has expired, or for any  other  reason).



23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to  or  removed  from
the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

See  my  reply  to  question  22.  Additionally,  exceptions  should  apply
universally to all manner of works (e.g. teaching  use  should  receive  an
exception not only for text but also audiovisual media).
24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to  provide  for
a greater  degree  of  flexibility  in  the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
limitations and exceptions?

NO. On the contrary, such  regulations  should  be  harmonised  across  all
member states to reduce uncertainty about what is allowed where  and  when.
The fair use provisions I suggested earlier would  help  foster  innovative
use of culture.

25. If yes, what would be the best  approach  to  provide  for  flexibility?
(e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions  of
the directives, interpretations by the  Commission,  built-in  flexibility,
e.g. in the form of a fair-use or  fair  dealing  provision  /  open  norm,
etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages  and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible  effects  on  the
functioning of the Internal Market.

If mandatory fair use exceptions constitute "flexibility", then they are  a
good approach. In cases of doubt courts can provide interpretation, but the
regulations should be clear enough to  self-evidently  apply  to  the  most
common cases, so that pointless litigation is discouraged  and  its  threat
can't be used to chill free expression.

In the "copyright bargain", the public trades away certain rights (like the
right to modify and distribute) in order to obtain creative works. We  must
be careful not to trade away too many rights. While 70 years ago the  right
to copy was irrelevant to the end-user, it is a very relevant right now and
I no longer want to trade it away.

Making private copying a fair use right would give this by now  very  basic
right back to the public at the cost  of  possibly  slightly  reducing  the
revenues of the content industry (I say "slightly" because  the  fact  that
private copying is illegal today doesn't stop people from engaging  in  it,
so that any damage this is causing is already being caused). On  the  other
hand, it would free up law enforcement and legal resources because it would
no longer be perceived as necessary (or possible) to prosecure  individuals
who engage in copying.

26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in   your
experience, constitute a problem?

YES. While I have no personal experience, I think  it  creates  unnecessary
uncertainty and restricts the free movement of goods, services  and  people
if copyright exceptions are not harmonised.

27. In the event that limitations and  exceptions  established  at  national
level were to have cross-border effect, how should the  question  of  "fair
compensation"  be  addressed,  when  such  compensation  is  part  of   the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)


 I think there should be no national level. Exceptions as well as
 compensation should be handled at the European level.

A. Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law
a range of limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums, as well as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and
archiving[28] and enable on-site consultation of the works and other
subject matter in the collections of such institutions[29]. The public
lending (under an exception or limitation) by these establishments of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the Rental
and Lending Directive[30].

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and
other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1. Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records,  or  films)  -
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works - may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national  laws
allowing for the making of such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of
beneficiary establishments, the types of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use an exception to preserve
and archive specific works or other subject matter in your collection?
 (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced
 problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments, museum or
 archives of the preservation exception?

 NO.
29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 Archival and digital preservation of copyrighted  works,  including  public
 web pages, should be explicitly legal and "fair use". However, people - not
 just copyright holders - should be allowed, as a form of  data  protection,
 to have specific web pages removed from  publicly  accessible  archives  if
 their continued public availability would  constitute  undue  prejudice  to
 them. It should be noted that  the  public  interest  demands  that  public
 archives be available

 and as complete as possible; removals have to be justified. It  should  not
 be possible to opt out of archival preemptively or in bulk.

30. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
 its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions  should
 be covered and under which conditions?
 See my reply to question 29.
31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
 N/A

 2. Off-premises access to library collections
 Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the  consultation  of  works
 and other subject- matter (consulting an e-book,  watching  a  documentary)
 via dedicated terminals on the premises  of  such  establishments  for  the
 purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and
 other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user  is  not  on  the
 premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally  addressed
 in agreements between universities/libraries  and  publishers.  Some  argue
 that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,
 and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

32. (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
 experienced specific problems when  trying  to  negotiate  agreements  with
 rights holders that enable you to provide remote access,  including  across
 borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for  purposes  of  research
 and private study?
b) [In particular if you are an end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
 specific problems when trying to consult, including across  borders,  works
 and other subject- matter held in the collections of institutions  such  as
 universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of the
 institutions in question?
c)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
 agreements with institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
 provide remote access, including across borders,  to  the  works  or  other
 subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research  and  private
 study?
 YES.  As  a  university  researcher  I  sometimes  found  it  frustratingly
 difficult to access paywall-protected archives of scientific journals  from
 outside the university.

33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

 Access to material stored in public libraries should be universal and free,
 subject to reasonable but generous individual quotas. A single person  need
 not be able to download the contents of an entire library in a day (not  in
 consideration of the interests of rightsholders but in  order  to  conserve
 the resources of the library), but research might entail downloading dozens
 of books in a  single  day.  In  case  of  suspected  abuse,  it  would  be
 acceptable to have the user justify their need for  such  a  high  rate  of
 downloading.

 Libraries could easily meter how often each work is  accessed.  This  could
 form the basis for some sort of compensation for rightsholders (noting that
 currently no such compensation necessarily  exists  in  all/any  EU  member
 states, so that this would be a concession to rightsholders).


34. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
 its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions  should
 be covered and under which conditions?
 N/A
35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
 NA
 3. E - lending
 Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works  (i.e.
 books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their  users.  Recent  technological
 developments have made it technically possible  for  libraries  to  provide
 users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books,  music  or
 films via networks. Under the current legal framework,  libraries  need  to
 obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise  such  e-lending
 activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and  libraries   are
 currently experimenting with  different  business  models  for  the  making
 available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to  libraries
 by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced  specific
 problems when trying to  negotiate  agreements  to  enable  the  electronic
 lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or other  materials
 held in your collection?
b) [In particular if you are an end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
 specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books  or   other   materials
 electronically (e-lending), including  across  borders,  from  institutions
 such as public libraries?
c)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
 agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or  other  materials
 electronically, including across borders?

 NO.

37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

 Insisting on creating artificial scarcity seems stupid and contrary to  the
 public interest (which is what should matter  here).  The  reality  of  the
 matter is that - contrary to what you may have heard - it is impossible  to
 provide only "temporary access" to digital works.  Any  attempt  to  do  so
 either requires placing unwarranted faith in some  copy  protection  scheme
 and/or overbroad and ab ovo ineffective legislation  to  ban  circumvention
 measures. In the face of this, and no doubt substantial pressure  from  the
 content lobby, perhaps it would be acceptable to charge  users  of  digital
 lending some very modest flat per month fee and distribute  proceeds  among
 the rightsholders in proportion to the amount digital "lending" their works
 see. In effect, this would be a public version of something like Netflix.
 However, as a matter of principle, I think the purpose of libraries is  not
 to "lend books" but to make culture available to as large  an  audience  as
 possible, with as little cost to the audience as  possible.  We  can  start
 thinking about compensating rightsholders when  they  start  going  out  of
 business due to a sudden surge of e-lending.

38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:]  What  differences  do
 you see in the management of physical  and  online  collections,  including
 providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?

 N/A


39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do  you  see
between libraries' traditional activities such as on-premises  consultation
or public lending  and  activities  such  as  off-premises  (online,  at  a
distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?

In the case of public lending, physical scarcrity  exists  and  thus  works
that are in very high  demand  may  receive  more  sales  even  if  they're
available from libraries (because libraries are  be  unable  to  serve  the
demand).
In the case of digital  lending,  no  practical  limit  on  the  number  of
borrowed copies exists and a single library might in theory provide a  copy
for every interested consumer. This would then allegedly lead to a loss  of
sales; however, 1. people will still want to own physical  books  and  keep
buying them; 2. the public interest should outweigh the  private  interests
of publishers as long as sufficiently high-quality works are published at a
sufficient rate.

4. Mass digitisation
The term "mass digitisation" is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum  of
Understanding (MoU) on  key  principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in
the normal channels of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors  and
publishers on the other[31].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such  licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting
society or  the  recognition  of  an  "extended  effect"  to  the  licences
granted)[32].

40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting  to
engage  in  mass  digitisation  projects,  a  right  holder,  a  collective
management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your  country  to  enact
legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements
concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have  a  crossborder
effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

NO OPINION.

41. Would it be  necessary  to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
agreed for  other  types  of  content  (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
collections, broadcasters' archives)?


 POSSIBLY. In this digital age, the differences between audio,  video,  text
 etc. are becoming blurred, because it's  all  just  numbers.  It  would  be
 absurd if it were not allowed to archive a number if  it  represents  audio
 while it would be allowed to archive the same number if it represents text,
 or vice versa.

 B. Teaching
 Directive 2001/29/EC[33]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
 national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  purpose   of
 illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions  would  typically
 allow a teacher to use parts of or full works  to  illustrate  his  course,
 e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles
 in the classroom or by showing protected content on a smart  board  without
 having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation
 of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation  at
 Member States level. The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
 Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing  instead
 a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some
 argue that the law should provide for  better  possibilities  for  distance
 learning and study at home.

42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or  an  institutional
 user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use  works  or
 other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including  across
 borders?
 (b) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
 specific problems resulting from the way in which works or  other  subject-
 matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

 I have no such first-hand experience, but I have read about cases where DRM
 prevented or otherwise made it difficult to legally use  copyrighted  works
 in classrooms.

43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

 Publishers of works should be required to furnish public schools with DRM
 free versions of any and all works the schools justifiably need for their
 teaching activities. Schools can be reasonably charged the price of one
 copy of the work. Circumventing DRM for the purposes of teaching at public
 schools should be a fair use right. Publishers should be required to assist
 in removing/circumventing their DRM in such cases.

44. What mechanisms exist in the market  place  to  facilitate  the  use  of
 content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

 I'm not aware of any such mechanism, but then I only use my own "content"
 when I teach (although some of it is derived from CC-licensed works of
 others).

 its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions  should

 C. Research
 Directive  2001/29/EC[34]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether  to
 implement in their national laws a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
 commercial scientific research. The open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
 provision allows for rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
 level.

47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
 user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or
 other subject matter in the context of research projects/activities,
 including across borders?
 (b) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
 specific problems resulting from the way in which works or  other  subject-
 matter are used in the context of research  projects/activities,  including
 across borders?

 YES. Paywall protected science archives make it unnecessarily difficult and
 costly to obtain access to peer reviewed scientific publications (including
 my own), even when they were  financed  from  public  funds.  The  business
 practices of such archives are  often  dubious  (as  evidenced  by  several
 boycotts and similar action against them from  members  of  the  scientific
 community; see e.g. http://thecostofknowledge.com/).

48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

 The paywall model of scientific publication  must  die.  In  particular  if
 public  funding  was  used  to  finance  some  research  (wholly  or  to  a
 substantial  part),  the  resultant  publications  should  be   mandatorily
 accessible to the public without paying a commercial 3rd party.  It  should
 be noted that science publishers have very few justifiable costs (even peer
 review is free these days).

 Research organisations should be encouraged (and later required) to provide
 their own, universal access to scientific publications  authored  by  their
 employees. Additionally, a central repository (or at least index) of global
 research could be set up by the EU, much like The Web of Science, but  with
 an open access policy. This would be a sensible investment in science.

 It should be impossible for researchers to enter  into  a  legally  binding
 contract with paywall sites or publishers that limit their  own  rights  to
 distribute their own papers. It should be illegal to demand payment (beyond
 the  actual  cost  of  transmission  or  copying)  to   access   scientific
 publications that received public funding.
 Science is a service to humanity, not a business. The benefits of publicly
 funded science should be freely available to all.

49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States  to  facilitate  the  use  of
 content for research purposes? How successful are they?

 In Hungary, universities (and perhaps the government)  pay  for  access  to
 paywall-protected  science  archives  and  then  provide  this  access   to
 researchers. The system sort of works but there are cumbersome  limitations
 (such as authentication by IP address).


D. Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC[35]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a  disability.  The  open  formulation  of  this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works  published  in
special formats and facilitating their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [36].

The Marrakesh Treaty[37] has been adopted to facilitate access to published
works for persons who are blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows
organisations for the blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired  persons   without   the
authorisation of the rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50. (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an
organisation representing persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced
problems with accessibility to content, including across borders, arising
from Member States' implementation of this exception?
b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons
with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems when
distributing/communicating works published in special formats across the
EU?
c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced  specific
 problems resulting  from  the  application  of  limitations  or  exceptions
 allowing for the distribution/communication of works published  in  special
 formats, including across borders?
 NO OPINION.

E. Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[38] are different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made  of  relevant
texts and data in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to  e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is made
of the relevant texts and data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or
other subject matter, it is necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whether the main problems arising in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain  "access"  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific  content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe"[39]. In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered that a  specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis  of  a
distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or  an  institutional
 user:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying  to
 use text or data mining methods, including across borders?
b) [In particular if you are  a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
 obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services based  on  text  or
 data mining methods, including across borders?
c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced  specific
 problems resulting from the use of text and  data  mining  in  relation  to
 copyright protected content, including across borders?
 NO OPINION.

 N/A
55. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
 its main elements? Which  activities  should  be  covered  and  under  what
 conditions?


It is my view that text or data mining does not require a permanent copy of
the work(s) being mined; thus, if access is provided and/or temporary
copies can be made, text or data mining is already covered by existing law.

56. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

N/A

57.  Are  there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

Many websites make it unnecessarily hard to access their text, by hiding it
in images or pdf files or flash animations. This is not only a problem for
data mining but also for screen readers used by blind people.

F. User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and
distribute content at little to no financial cost. As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the making  of
so-called "user-generated content". While users can create totally original
content, they can also take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs53. User-generated content  (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not "new" as such. However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is no longer  the  preserve  of  a  technically  and
artistically adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and  the
users generating the content. In any event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users  were
pledged by rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
"Licences for Europe" discussions54.

58. (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
experienced problems
when  trying  to  use  pre-existing  works  or  other  subject  matter   to
disseminate new content

on    the  Internet,   including  across     borders?
b) [In particular if you are  a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or other subject- matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?
c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced  problems
resulting from the way the users are  using  pre-existing  works  or  other
subject-matter to disseminate new content on the Internet, including across
borders?

As an end user: YES. I have  seen  many  creative  works  based  on  other,
copyrighted creative works being taken down  from  e.g.  YouTube,  even  in
cases where  applicable  American  law  would  have  provided  a  fair  use
exception (e.g. because the work was a parody).

As an author: YES. I  found  a  diploma  thesis  online  that  contained  a
substantial excerpt from course material I had  written.  I  contacted  the
website operator and at first they  didn't  understand  what  I  wanted  (I
wanted my Creative Commons license enforced, but they thought I wanted  the
diploma thesis taken down - no doubt the  result  of  bad  experience  with
other authors in the past).

59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a  right  holder:]
Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works)  is  properly  identified  for
online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient     in   this  context?  (b)
[In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities
for users that are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on
the basis of pre-existing works) through your service to properly  identify
these works for online use?

NO OPINION.

60. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right  holder):]
Have you experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use  of
the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
(b) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?

NO. In all cases where I created works on the basis of pre-existing  works,
both the original work and my derived work were covered by a free  license,
so that I was neither automatically entitled to remuneration nor did I seek
it.

However, I believe it would prove problematic for me to  collect  donations
from users of my creative works, from a tax perspective.

61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

National tax laws should be updated to allow creators of  free/libre  works
(e.g. free software, Creative Commons licensed art etc.) to easily  collect
donations from end-users; for example, such donations could be treated like
royalties from a tax perspective.

Authors of free/libre works should  not  have  to  pay  a  portion  of  the
proceeds to the national rights  management  outfit.  The  basis  for  such
levies is  that  the  rights  management  outfit  would  help  enforce  the
copyright of the author, which is in the interest of the author; therefore,
it is fair for the author to pay for this service. However, in the case  of
free/libre works, copyright doesn't serve the interests of the  author;  it
serves the public interest, and

therefore any enforcement on the part of the rights  management  outfit  is
also in the public interest, not in the interest of the author. It would be
unfair to have the author pay for it.

Also see my reply to question 80.

62. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which  activities  should  be  covered  and  under  what
conditions?

It is in the public interest to  allow  derivative  creative  works  to  be
created, and this interest  should  outweigh  the  financial  interests  of
rightsholders. However, there must be reasonably high bar for a  derivative
work to be considered original  enough  to  warrant  an  exception  to  the
copyright of the  original  work(s).  Fair  use  exceptions  (such  as  for
parodies) should of course apply too.
The extent to which trademarks or patents can tresspass on fair use  rights
should be limited somehow (e.g. if the name of Gandalf is  trademarked,  it
should still be possible and legal for authors of  not-for-profit  Lord  of
the Rings fan fiction to include the character in their works).

63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
NA

                     IV. Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[40]. Levies are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a  view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making
copies for their private use) or through use  of  certain  technique  (i.e.
reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the  question  arises
as to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers' licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies
to certain types of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.
64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the  scope  and
 application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[41]  in  the
 digital environment?

 As indicated before, I believe that it is no longer fair  to  bargain  away
 the right of the public to create private copies, like it was 70 years  ago
 (when copying,  especially  in  bulk,  was  only  available  to  commercial
 enterprises). The copyright bargain should be amended so that, once  again,
 copyright would be gone from people's living rooms and all  the  activities
 an average person would want to engage in would automatically be legal.

 Therefore, copyright should be reformed  so  that  private,  non-commercial
 copying is simply not restricted anymore. This would just  codify  reality,
 where people copy everything anyway; criminalising this just creates a huge
 disconnect between what people experience as natural and what the  law  is,
 which I think is bad for society as a  whole.  Laws  should  mostly  forbid
 things that are intuitively wrong, and sharing culture is hardly wrong. Joe
 Average should not be required to know or understand copyright in order  to
 live his life legally.

 An "illegal" copy does not equal a lost sale (see e.g. this report  by  the
 US Government  Accountability  Office:  http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-
 423); in fact copies can be seen as promoting uncopiable experiences,  such
 as live performances in the case of music, which is probably why the income
 of Scandinavian musicians increased markedly  since  the  advent  of  file-
 sharing. Additionally, a greater variety of art (especially music)  is  now
 available than before, when record labels controlled the supply.

 Copies of many forms of art have become or are becoming, de  facto,  almost
 free, so that businesses have to find  ways  of  making  money  other  than
 selling copies. Thinking of copies  as  marketing  material  that  draws  a
 concert audience seems to have worked for many musicians.

65. Should digital copies made by end users  for  private  purposes  in  the
 context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where  the
 harm  to  the  rightholder  is  minimal,  be  subject  to  private  copying
 levies?[42]

 If private copying were explicitly legal (in the  interest  of  the  public
 good), then there would be no  justification  for  private  copying  levies
 either, and this question would not even  arise.  I  think  this  would  be
 desirable. Private copying levies cannot be expected to keep pace with  the
 rate at which the amount of digital storage available to an  individual  is
 increasing. Soon, it will be quite practicable to  carry  around  e.g.  all
 music published since 1950 in one's pocket. This means that for every  Euro
 of copying levy, people will be able  to  place  more  and  more  protected
 "content" on their storage media. The logical conclusion is  that  after  a
 point, levies will be negligible compared to the amount of "illegal" copies
 stored and their alleged "worth" (due to the ease of creating copies, their
 actual worth will be close to zero). The only sensible thing seems to be to
 do away with these levies altogether; they only serve to help  conserve  an
 obsolescent business  model  founded  on  the  commercial  distribution  of
 copies. I predict that in a few decades it will be impossible to  make  any
 substantial amount of money from selling  copies,  levies  notwithstanding.
 Therefore, we should give the physical distribution businesses some  finite
 time to finally adapt to the changed times (maybe 5 more  years)  and  then
 abolish restrictions on private, not-for-profit copying completely.


66. How would changes in levies with respect to the  application  to  online
 services (e.g. services based on cloud computing  allowing,  for  instance,
 users to have copies on  different  devices)  impact  the  development  and
 functioning of new business models on  the  one  hand  and  rightholders  '
 revenue on the other?

 Currently, outdated copyright regulations are  acting  as  a  handbrake  on
 innovation. For example, streaming and "making available for download"  are
 often treated differently whereas they are the same thing (a stream can  be
 stored instead of playing it back immediately). Innovating in this area  is
 risky because if a new technology is perceived as  "facilitating  copyright
 infringement" (i. e. private copying), the innovator can face  heavy  fines
 or  even  jail  time  (authors  of  popular,  innovative  p2p  file-sharing
 applications have been prosecuted even though they didn't infringe anyone's
 copyrights, as have the authors of  Mulve,  a  search  engine  for  Russian
 social       networking       website       ВКонтакте;       see       e.g.
 http://torrentfreak.com/police-arrest-operators-of-mulve-downloading-app-
 101008/).

 While publishers' revenue might decrease if copying restrictions were  more
 lax (this  is  far  from  certain,  but  it's  possible),  their  financial
 interests cannot be as important as the public interest, which is  ease  of
 access to  culture.  The  financial  interests  of  rightsholders  must  be
 protected only to the extent that a sufficient number of them are  able  to
 make a decent living for new creative  works  to  keep  being  created  and
 published.
67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible  on  the  invoices
 for products subject to levies?[43]

 YES. It would allow consumers to see how much they are paying to support an
 obsolescent business model. Increasing the visibility of these levies would
 lead to a more informed public debate about the future of copyright.

 Diverging national systems levy  different  products  and  apply  different
 tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free  circulation  of  goods  and
 services in the Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
 continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying  levies
 to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product  subject
 to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that  context,  not
 all Member States have ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
 schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of  undue
 payments[44].

68. Have you  experienced  a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
 resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or
 other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

 UNCERTAIN.

69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to  persons  other
 than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying?  Do
 any of those transactions result  in  undue  payments?  Please  explain  in
 detail the example you provide (type  of  products,  type  of  transaction,
 stakeholders, etc.).


 I have no idea as to the actual percentage, but  a  substantial  amount  of
 e.g. optical media is sold to companies (and individuals!) who use them  to
 archive their own data and not to store  "illegal"  copies  of  copyrighted
 material.
 Additionally, it is entirely possible and legal to obtain such  media  from
 EU member states where the levies are  lowest  (as  it  should  be),  which
 distorts the levy system.

70. Where such undue payments  arise,  what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
 affect?  To  what  extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or   ex   post
 reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy  the
 situation?

 As noted above, I believe all such levies should be abolished as they  will
 necessarily become less and less effective anway, to the point  where  they
 will be completely meaningless.
71. If you have identified specific problems with  the  current  functioning
 of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?

 Abolish levies. Legalise private, not-for-profit copying. Force the content
 industry to move with the times, in the name of public interest.

               V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers
 The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a  number  of
 exclusive rights and, in the case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
 fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions  in  the
 EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors  or
 performers to producers[45] or determining who the owner of the  rights  is
 when the work or other subject matter is  created  in  the  context  of  an
 employment contract[46]. This is an area that has been  traditionally  left
 for Member States to regulate and  there  are  significant  differences  in
 regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
 sectors of the creative industries.

 Concerns continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
 adequately remunerated, in particular but not  solely,  as  regards  online
 exploitation. Many consider that the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
 exploitation is not being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
 Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual  practices,  negotiation
 mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
 lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders  are  of  the
 opinion that rules at national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
 situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

 72. [In particular if you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
 mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to  ensure  that  you  receive  an
 adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?

 In the medium term, it will be hopeless to  make  money  trying  to  charge
 people for copies of musical recordings except for very  successful,  high-
 profile musicians. The copy, being easy to produce  at  no  cost,  will  be
 practically worthless. Musicians will have to find other sources of  income
 (such as concert tickets) and think of recordings as  a  way  of  promoting
 their concerts. It will likely no longer be possible to  become  fabulously
 rich by being a famous  musician,  but  on  the  other  hand  perhaps  more
 musicians will be able to make a decent living.


 The role of publishers and other intermediaries will (and should) diminish;
 there is no longer a need for publishers to control the supply of music  as
 the Internet and social networking allow people to find what they like  and
 pay the artists directly. Additionally, national and EU level grants  could
 be set up to finance music with high  artistic  value  but  low  commercial
 potential/success. (Also see my reply to question 80.)

 I am (among other  things)  a  technical  writer  and  lecturer/instructor.
 Trying to sell  my  course  material  directly  is  not  something  I  have
 seriously considered. Since it is most useful to the students in electronic
 form, I publish it online under a Creative Commons license for all  to  see
 and consider it a form of promoting  my  lectures.  When  I  get  hired  to
 lecture, I'm the guy who wrote all that awesome, free course  material  and
 am probably able to charge  more  than  other  lecturers  who  can't  claim
 authorship of a useful online resource.
73. Is there a need to act  at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
 certain clauses in contracts)?

 YES. Music publishers (nowadays especially  iTunes)  have  disproportionate
 power when negotiating contracts with artists. Some  clauses  are  directly
 harmful to the interests of artists and should be prohibited; for  example,
 it should be very hard to make music recordings "work for hire". It  should
 be  difficult  or  impossible  for   copyright   to   transfer   from   the
 composer/performer  to  a   publisher,   especially   indefinitely   and/or
 exclusively.

 Great transparency is needed to make sure publishers don't swindle  artists
 (see e.g. the high profile  case  where  a  number  of  big  record  labels
 "forgot" to pay artists for songs included in  compilation  CDs  (see  e.g.
 http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2009/12/08/artists-sue- canadi an-label s-over-
 compilati on-album s).

74. If you consider that the current rules are  not  effective,  what  would
 you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

 See my reply to questions 72 and 73.

                           VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE[47] provides for a harmonised framework for the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright  and
related rights. The Commission has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[48].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in
case of infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen
respect for copyright when the infringed content is used for  a  commercial
purpose[49]. One means to do this could be to clarify the role

of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[50]. At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

75. Should  the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
 efficient for  infringements  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
 purpose?

 YES. Injunctive relief should be readily available, across borders, against
 parties that profit from  illegal  distribution  of  creative  works  on  a
 commercial scale.

 This must not, however, include authors of software used to commit the
 infringement, or operators of a website 3rd parties use for infringement,
 unless these people personally profit from the infringement and/or they
 specifically market the software or the website as a means of obtaining
 copyrighted content.

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow  for
 sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as   Internet   service
 providers, advertising brokers,  payment  service  providers,  domain  name
 registrars, etc.) in  inhibiting  online  copyright  infringements  with  a
 commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be  useful  to  foster  the
 cooperation of intermediaries?

 Intermediaries should only be required to cooperate if so ordered by a
 court. There should be a process by which a court order of the appropriate
 jurisdiction can be easily obtained if one exists for a different
 jurisdiction. This depends on copyright law being largely harmonised across
 the EU.

 Intermediaries should never be liable for copyright  infringements  of  3rd
 parties.

77. Does the current civil  enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
 balance is achieved between the right to have one's copyright respected and
 other rights such as the protection  of  private  life  and  protection  of
 personal data?

 NO. We're seeing a push by the content industry to force internet service
 providers to become "copyright cops": listen in on traffic and stop or
 report suspected infringements (see e.g. <http://torrentfreak.com/isp-
 secret-anti-bittorrent-piracy-talks-are-failing-120322/>,
 <http://torrentfreak.com/music-industry-threaten-openbittorrents-new-
 hosting-provider- 100711/>, <https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/08/tpp-
 creates-liabilities-isps-and-put-your- rights-risk> or
 <http://torrentfreak.com/prs-wants-isps-to-pay-for-pirating-customers-
 100714/>). This push has been at least partially successful in e.g. the UK.
 This goes too far. The right to privacy is much more important and
 fundamental than copyright.

 The solution is, again, the complete legalisation of non-commercial private
 copying, which happens on a large scale anyway and is impossible  to  stop.
 This would make the entire issue moot.

                      VII. A single EU Copyright Title
 The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been  present  in
 the copyright debate for quite some time now,  although  views  as  to  the
 merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A  unified  EU
 Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU
 and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of
 a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner  in  which  a
 truly Single Market for content protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
 while others believe that the

 same objective can better be achieved by establishing  a  higher  level  of
 harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain  degree  of  flexibility  and
 specificity in Member States' legal systems.

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU  Copyright  Title,
 as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions
 to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

 YES. However, it should all strcitly happen in the public interest, not  in
 the interest of the entertainment industry (domestic or American).

79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the  EU?
 Does the current level of difference among  the  Member  State  legislation
 mean that this is a longer term project?

                             VIII. Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the
most important matters relating to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright. Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

 80. ^re there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework
 for copyright? Please explain and  indicate  how  such  matters  should  be
 addressed.

 Several issues come to mind. Please see below.

                       Why does copyright even exist?
The most fundamental issue is what the point of copyright is (I touched  on
this  briefly  before).  I  would  like  to  quote  Richard  M.  Stallman's
"Misinterpreting  Copyright  -  A  Series  of  Errors"   (downloaded   from
httpy/www.gnu.org/philosophy/misinterpreting-copyright.html),   because   I
agree with it and couldn't say it  better.  Note  that  while  the  USA  is
mentioned in several places, the same principles apply or should  apply  to
the EU as well.

     "When the US Constitution was  drafted,  the  idea  that  authors  were
     entitled  to  a  copyright  monopoly  was  proposed—and  rejected.  The
     founders of our country adopted a different premise, that copyright  is
     not a natural right of authors, but an artificial  concession  made  to
     them for the sake of progress. The Constitution gives permission for  a
     copyright system with this paragraph (Article I, Section 8):

       [Congress shall have the power] to promote the  Progress  of  Science
       and the useful Arts, by securing for limited  Times  to  Authors  and
       Inventors the  exclusive  Right  to  their  respective  Writings  and
       Discoveries.
     The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that promoting progress means
     benefit for the users of copyrighted works. For example, in Fox Film v.
     Doyal, the court said,

       The sole interest of the United States  and  the  primary  object  in
       conferring the [copyright]  monopoly  lie  in  the  general  benefits
       derived by the public from the labors of authors.

     This fundamental decision explains why copyright is not required by the
     Constitution, only permitted as an option—and why  it  is  supposed  to
     last for "limited times." If copyright were a natural right,  something
     that authors have  because  they  deserve  it,  nothing  could  justify
     terminating this right after a certain period of time,  any  more  than
     everyone's house should become public property after a certain lapse of
     time from its construction.


The "copyright bargain"
    The copyright system works by providing privileges and thus benefits to
    publishers and authors; but it does not do this for their sake. Rather,
    it does this to modify their behavior:  to  provide  an  incentive  for
    authors to write more and  publish  more.  In  effect,  the  government
    spends the public's natural rights, on the public's behalf, as part  of
    a deal to bring the public more published works.  Legal  scholars  call
    this concept the "copyright bargain." It is like a government  purchase
    of a highway or an airplane using taxpayers'  money,  except  that  the
    government spends our freedom instead of our money.
    But is the bargain as it exists actually a good deal  for  the  public?
    Many alternative bargains are possible; which one is best? Every  issue
    of copyright policy is part of this question. If we  misunderstand  the
    nature of the question, we will tend to decide the issues badly.
    The Constitution authorizes granting copyright powers  to  authors.  In
    practice, authors typically cede them to publishers; it is usually  the
    publishers, not the authors, who exercise these powers and get most  of
    the benefits, though authors may  get  a  small  portion.  Thus  it  is
    usually the publishers that lobby  to  increase  copyright  powers.  To
    better reflect the reality of copyright  rather  than  the  myth,  this
    article refers to publishers rather than  authors  as  the  holders  of
    copyright powers. It also refers to the users of copyrighted  works  as
    "readers," even though using them does not always mean reading, because
    "the users" is remote and abstract.

The first error: "striking a balance"
    The copyright bargain places the public first: benefit for the  reading
    public is an end in itself; benefits (if any) for publishers are just a
    means toward that end. Readers' interests and publishers' interests are
    thus  qualitatively  unequal   in   priority.   The   first   step   in
    misinterpreting the purpose  of  copyright  is  the  elevation  of  the
    publishers to the same level of importance as the readers.
    It is often said that US copyright law is meant to "strike  a  balance"
    between the interests of publishers and readers. Those  who  cite  this
    interpretation present it as a restatement of the basic position stated
    in the Constitution; in other words, it is supposed to be equivalent to
    the copyright bargain.
    But the two interpretations are far from equivalent; they are different
    conceptually, and different in their implications. The balance  concept
    assumes  that  the  readers'  and  publishers'  interests   differ   in
    importance only quantitatively, in how much weight we should give them,
    and in what actions they apply to. The  term  "stakeholders"  is  often
    used to frame the issue in this way;  it  assumes  that  all  kinds  of
    interest in a policy decision are equally important. This view  rejects
    the  qualitative  distinction  between  the  readers'  and  publishers'
    interests which is at the root of the government's participation in the
    copyright bargain.
    The consequences of this alteration are far-reaching, because the great
    protection for the  public  in  the  copyright  bargain—the  idea  that
    copyright privileges can be justified only in the name of the  readers,
    never in the name of  the  publishers—is  discarded  by  the  "balance"
    interpretation. Since the interest of the publishers is regarded as  an
    end in itself, it can justify copyright privileges; in other words, the
    "balance" concept says that privileges can be justified in the name  of
    someone other than the public.
    As a practical matter, the consequence of the "balance" concept  is  to
    reverse the burden of justification for changes in copyright  law.  The
    copyright bargain places the burden on the publishers to  convince  the
    readers to cede certain freedoms. The concept of balance reverses  this
    burden, practically speaking, because there is generally no doubt  that
    publishers will benefit from additional privilege. Unless harm  to  the
    readers can be proved, sufficient to "outweigh" this  benefit,  we  are
    led to  conclude  that  the  publishers  are  entitled  to  almost  any
    privilege they request.
    Since the idea of "striking a balance" between publishers  and  readers
    denies the readers the primacy they are entitled to, we must reject it.

Balancing against what?
    [...]
    In the copyright bargain, the government spends our freedom instead  of
    our money. Freedom is more precious than money, so  [the]  government's
    responsibility to spend our freedom wisely and frugally is even greater
    than its responsibility to spend our money thus. Governments must never
    put the publishers' interests on a par with the public's freedom.


Not "balance" but "trade-off"
    The idea of balancing the readers' interests against the publishers' is
    the wrong way to judge copyright  policy,  but  there  are  indeed  two
    interests to be weighed: two interests of the readers. Readers have  an
    interest in their own freedom in using published  works;  depending  on
    circumstances,  they  may  also  have  an   interest   in   encouraging
    publication through some kind of incentive system.
    The word "balance," in discussions of copyright, has come to  stand  as
    shorthand for the idea of "striking a balance" between the readers  and
    the publishers. Therefore, to use the word "balance" in regard  to  the
    readers' two interests would be confusing. We need another term.
    In general, when one party has two  goals  that  partly  conflict,  and
    cannot completely achieve both of them, we  call  this  a  "trade-off."
    Therefore, rather than speaking of "striking the right balance" between
    parties, we should  speak  of  "finding  the  right  trade-off  between
    spending our freedom and keeping it." [...]

The second error: maximizing one output
    The second mistake in copyright policy consists of adopting the goal of
    maximizing—not just increasing —the  number  of  published  works.  The
    erroneous concept of "striking a balance" elevated  the  publishers  to
    parity with the readers; this second error places them  far  above  the
    readers.
    When we purchase something, we [...] generally [...] conserve funds for
    other purchases, by buying only what we need of  any  particular  good,
    and choosing a model of sufficient rather  than  highest  quality.  The
    principle of diminishing returns suggests that spending all  our  money
    on one particular good is [...] inefficient [...].
    Diminishing returns applies to copyright just as to any other purchase.
    The first freedoms we should trade away are those we  miss  the  least,
    and whose sacrifice gives the largest encouragement to publication.  As
    we trade additional freedoms that cut closer to home, we find that each
    trade is a bigger sacrifice than the last,  while  bringing  a  smaller
    increment in literary activity. Well before the increment becomes zero,
    we may well say it is not worth its incremental price;  we  would  then
    settle on a bargain whose overall result is to increase the  amount  of
    publication, but not to the utmost possible extent.
    Accepting the goal of maximizing publication rejects all  these  wiser,
    more advantageous bargains in advance—it dictates that the public  must
    cede nearly all of its freedom to  use  published  works,  for  just  a
    little more publication.

The rhetoric of maximization
    In practice, the goal of maximizing publication regardless of the  cost
    to freedom is supported  by  widespread  rhetoric  which  asserts  that
    public copying is illegitimate, unfair, and intrinsically wrong. [... ]
    The "pirate" rhetoric is typically accepted because it so pervades  the
    media that few people realize  how  radical  it  is.  It  is  effective
    because if copying by the public is fundamentally illegitimate, we  can
    never object to the publishers' demand that we surrender our freedom to
    do so. In other words, when  the  public  is  challenged  to  show  why
    publishers should not receive some additional power, the most important
    reason of all — "We  want  to  copy"  —  is  disqualified  in  advance.
    [emphasis added]
    This leaves no way to argue against increasing copyright  power  except
    using side issues. Hence, opposition to stronger copyright powers today
    almost exclusively cites side issues, and never dares cite the  freedom
    to distribute copies as a legitimate public value.
    As a practical matter, the goal of maximization enables  publishers  to
    argue that "A certain practice is reducing our  sales—or  we  think  it
    might—so we presume it diminishes publication by some  unknown  amount,
    and therefore it should be prohibited." We are led  to  the  outrageous
    conclusion that the public good is measured by publishers' sales[...].

The third error: maximizing publishers' power
    Once the  publishers  have  obtained  assent  to  the  policy  goal  of
    maximizing publication output at any cost, their next step is to  infer
    that this requires  giving  them  the  maximum  possible  powers—making
    copyright cover every imaginable use of a work, or applying some  other
    legal tool such as "shrink wrap" licenses to  equivalent  effect.  This
    goal, which entails the abolition of "fair use" and the "right of first
    sale," is being pressed at every available level  of  government,  from
    states of the US to international bodies.


    This step is erroneous because  strict  copyright  rules  obstruct  the
    creation of useful new works. For instance,  Shakespeare  borrowed  the
    plots of some of his plays  from  works  others  had  published  a  few
    decades before, so if today's copyright law had  been  in  effect,  his
    plays would have been illegal.
    Even if we wanted the highest possible rate of publication,  regardless
    of cost to the public, maximizing publishers' power is the wrong way to
    get it. As a means of promoting progress, it is self-defeating.

The results of the three errors
    The current trend  in  copyright  legislation  is  to  hand  publishers
    broader powers for longer periods of  time.  The  conceptual  basis  of
    copyright, as it emerges distorted from the series  of  errors,  rarely
    offers a basis for saying no. Legislators give lip service to the  idea
    that copyright serves the  public,  while  in  fact  giving  publishers
    whatever they ask for.
    For example, here is what Senator Hatch said when introducing S. 483, a
    1995 bill to increase the term of copyright by 20 years:
       I believe we are now at such a point with respect to the question  of
       whether  the  current  term  of  copyright  adequately  protects  the
       interests of authors and the related question of whether the term  of
       protection continues  to  provide  a  sufficient  incentive  for  the
       creation of new works of authorship.
    This bill extended the copyright on  already  published  works  written
    since the 1920s. This change was  a  giveaway  to  publishers  with  no
    possible benefit to the public, since there is no way to  retroactively
    increase now the number of books published back then. Yet it  cost  the
    public a freedom that is meaningful today—the freedom  to  redistribute
    books from that era.
    The bill also extended the copyrights of works yet to be  written.  For
    works made for hire, copyright would  last  95  years  instead  of  the
    present 75 years. Theoretically this would increase  the  incentive  to
    write new works; but any publisher  that  claims  to  need  this  extra
    incentive should be required  substantiate  the  claim  with  projected
    balance sheets for 75 years in the future.
[...]
    Another law, passed in 1997, made it a felony to make sufficiently many
    copies of any published work, even if you give  them  away  to  friends
    just to be nice. Previously this was not a crime in the US at all.
    An even worse law, the Digital Millennium  Copyright  Act  (DMCA),  was
    designed to bring back copy protection (which computer users detest) by
    making it a crime to break copy protection, or even publish information
    about how to break it. This law ought to be called the  "Domination  by
    Media Corporations Act" because it effectively  offers  publishers  the
    chance to write their own copyright law. It says they  can  impose  any
    restrictions whatsoever on the use of a work,  and  these  restrictions
    take the force of law [emphasis added] provided the work contains  some
    sort of encryption or license manager to enforce them.

Finding the right bargain
    What is the proper way to decide copyright policy? If  copyright  is  a
    bargain made on behalf of  the  public,  it  should  serve  the  public
    interest above all. The government's duty  when  selling  the  public's
    freedom is to sell only  what  it  must,  and  sell  it  as  dearly  as
    possible. At the  very  least,  we  should  pare  back  the  extent  of
    copyright as much as possible while maintaining a comparable  level  of
    publication.
    Since we cannot find this minimum price in freedom through  competitive
    bidding, as we do for construction projects, how can we find it?
    One possible method is to reduce copyright privileges  in  stages,  and
    observe the results. By seeing if and when  measurable  diminutions  in
    publication occur, we will learn how much  copyright  power  is  really
    necessary to achieve the public's  purposes.  We  must  judge  this  by
    actual observation, not by what publishers  say  will  happen,  because
    they have every incentive to make exaggerated predictions  of  doom  if
    their powers are reduced in any way.
    Copyright policy includes several independent dimensions, which can  be
    adjusted separately. After we find the necessary minimum for one policy
    dimension, it may still be  possible  to  reduce  other  dimensions  of
    copyright while maintaining the desired publication level.


     Another dimension of copyright policy is the extent of fair  use:  some
     ways of reproducing all or part of a published work  that  are  legally
     permitted even though it is copyrighted.  The  natural  first  step  in
     reducing this dimension of copyright  power  is  to  permit  occasional
     private small-quantity noncommercial  copying  and  distribution  among
     individuals. This would eliminate the intrusion of the copyright police
     into people's private lives, but would probably have little  effect  on
     the sales of published works. (It may be necessary to take other  legal
     steps to ensure that shrink-wrap licenses cannot be used to  substitute
     for copyright in restricting such copying.) The experience  of  Napster
     shows that we should also permit noncommercial verbatim  redistribution
     to the general public—when so many of  the  public  want  to  copy  and
     share, and find it so useful, only draconian measures will  stop  them,
     and the public deserves to get what it wants.
[...]
     Changes like these could bring copyright into line  with  the  public's
     wish to use digital technology to copy. Publishers will no  doubt  find
     these proposals "unbalanced"; they may threaten to take  their  marbles
     and go home, but they won't really do it, because the game will  remain
     profitable and it will be the only game in town.
     As we consider reductions in copyright power, we must make  sure  media
     companies do not simply replace it with end-user license agreements. It
     would  be  necessary  to  prohibit  the  use  of  contracts  to   apply
     restrictions on  copying  that  go  beyond  those  of  copyright.  Such
     limitations on what mass-market nonnegotiated contracts can require are
     a standard part of the US legal system."
I think it is time the EU made a stand and explicitly and  publicly  stated
why copyright exists. Is its purpose to serve the public  interest?  Or  to
serve the interests of  rightsholders  against  the  public  interest  (cf.
"striking a balance")? I hope it's  the  former.  Unfortunately,  the  last
decade or so of copyright legislation was mostly a largely unfettered land-
grab by the publishing industry (it is worth pointing out that  if  today's
publishing industry lobbyists had had their say, several things we take for
granted      today      would       have       been       banned;       see
<http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100925/12401911168/a-look-at-the-
technologies-industries-senators-leahy-     hatch-would-have-banned-in-the-
past.shtml>). There have been very few legislative changes  that  benefited
the end-user.

              Differentiating between copyright and "copyleft"
Copyright (esp. in connection with copyright  licenses)  can  currently  be
used for one of two very  distinct  purposes:  1.  protecting  the  private
interests of an author (or, much more frequently, a publisher), by  placing
restrictions on  copying  and  the  production  of  derived  works;  or  2.
protecting the interests of  the  general  public  by  explicitly  allowing
copying, distribution and the creation of derived works  on  the  condition
that copies and distributed derived works are distributed  under  the  same
license, thereby guaranteeing the same freedoms to all users.  This  latter
type of copyright license is commonly known as "copyleft"; notable examples
of such licenses are the  GNU  General  Public  License  and  the  Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.
I think it  would  be  reasonable  for  copyright  law  to  recognise  this
distinction in the following way: the copyright on works distributed  under
restrictive licenses (including the  case  where  no  explicit  license  is
provided) should expire much sooner than the copyright on works distributed
under "copyleft" licenses, because "copyleft" licensed  works  provide  the
public with even greater benefits than works in the public domain:  a  work
in the public domain can be  adapted  and  published  under  a  restrictive
license, whereas when a work distributed  under  a  "copyleft"  license  is
adapted, the adaptation can only be distributed under a free license,  thus
granting the general public more freedoms.
Considering this, and the fact that authors of  "copyleft"  licensed  works
are essentially working directly for the public benefit, I  would  find  it
reasonable for "copyleft" licenses to be enforced more strictly,  and  with
more involvement of public law  enforcement,  than  conventional  copyright
(where the rightsholder can be reasonably expected to step  up  himself  or
herself in  order  to  protect  their  own  interests).  The  author  of  a
"copylefted" work has comparatively little motivation to step up and expend
even more of his or her own resources prosecuting  violators;  however,  in
the case of such works, prosecuting violators is in the public interest.
Once more, the key difference here is that "copyleft" licenses protect  the
public interest, while traditional copyright protects a  private  interest.
This fundamental difference, I think, merits different treatment in law  as
well as its enforcement.


                  The length of copyright protection terms
As indicated earlier, I believe copyright protection  terms  are  much  too
long. Allow me to share a personal anecdote. One of  my  great-grandfathers
was a writer and playwright of some renown; a number of his plays are still
being performed in theatres. Their copyright protection term hasn't expired
yet because he passed away in 1964, less than 70 (or is it 90  now?)  years
ago, but still more than a decade before I was born. Thus I obviously never
knew him, or he me; it is unlikely that he  worked  because  he  wanted  to
provide me with financial security. Throughout his career, he had many much
more immediate problems: poverty; being imprisoned or having  to  flee  for
his political views; and, occasionally, the prospect of starving along with
his wife and four children.
Still, theatres dutifully pay me (as the sole inheritor of his copyright) a
few percent of their ticket income when they put his plays on.  Sadly,  I'm
not sufficiently strong of character to refuse this  money  I'm  apparently
entitled to, or to donate it to charities; however, I must  point  out  how
unreasonable and unfair this state of affairs is.
I'm pretty well off and can certainly make  a  living  even  without  these
payments. (The income band where they would  make  the  difference  between
being and not being able to make a living is very narrow.)
I had no  part  in  the  creation  of  the  works  in  question,  not  even
indirectly. I do little to promote them.
The theatres are typically relatively poor.
The artist who created these works suffered from poverty or  its  immediate
prospect throughout his career.
There probably are a number of other talented, notable artists  who  suffer
similarly (and whose progeny  stands  to  benefit  from  their  labour  for
decades after their death).
Instead of having the theatres pay me (and others in my position), it would
be better to use the  income  from  commercially  successful  art  to  help
finance art and/or science that is not (yet) commercially successful but is
of high artistic merit. Specifically, it  would  be  reasonable  to  divert
royalty payments due people above a certain  income  level  to  a  communal
culture fund of some sort even if no other change to the royalty system  is
made.
Of course, deciding what art merits support from the culture fund is  going
to be fraught with controversy; some governments may attempt to abuse  such
a system to supply artist  cronies  with  public  income  etc.  I  think  a
possible way of avoiding this would  be  to  have  only  "foreign"  artists
decide what "domestic" art to fund.
Another potential problem with the current copyright system is that  I,  as
the copyright inheritor, am allowed  to  block  publication  of  my  great-
grandfather's works for any frivolous reason, thereby depriving the  public
of these works. I think this power is too broad. While it may be  warranted
in some cases to block the creation of certain derivative works (ones  that
would, for example, be in such bad taste that they would reflect negatively
on the memory of the original  author),  this  would  have  to  be  weighed
against the protection of the freedom of expression. I'm undecided how this
would be best resolved; perhaps some independent  arbitration  board  could
adjudicate if necessary (but I don't know how to guarantee its independence
of the publishing industry).
I think it is reasonable to allow heirs to block publication of  works  the
original author had never published, for quite a long time.
On the whole, it seems that more differentiation than is currently possible
would be beneficial. For example, the right to block the publication of so-
far-unpublished works should expire later (probably decades later) than the
right to collect royalties on publication of previously published works.
It appears as though different genres should also  be  treated  differently
(where, of course, classification of a specific work into a specific  genre
may be difficult), based on how quickly works of a  genre  tend  to  return
their investment. Hollywood blockbusters often make  more  money  on  their
opening weekend than they cost  to  make;  therefore,  a  relatively  short
copyright term of, say, 5-10 years seems reasonable  (it  still  gives  the
studios plenty of time to make a profit). On the other hand, a longer  term
may be warranted in e.g. poetry (where a single author has to  be  able  to
make a living from selling his or her works).
However, if we take a step back and ask ourselves what  the  point  of  the
copyright monopoly is in the first place, a more elegant approach  presents
itself. The copyright monopoly exists  because  artists  (as  well  as  the
entertainment industry, whose output I would hesitate to unreservedly  call
"art") need to be able to make a living in order to be able to produce  art
(and then more art), and it is believed that this can be best guaranteed by
giving authors exclusive distribution rights for a limited time. While  I'm
not certain this assumption actually holds[51] (), let's go with it.


If all we need to guarantee is that the copyright  monopoly  term  is  long
enough to allow the author(s) to receive a sufficient amount of  money  for
commercial  distribution,  then  we  could  dispense   with   genre   based
differentiation and fixed copyright terms  altogether,  and  instead  focus
only on allowing the artists (as well as involved 3 rd parties) to  make  a
decent living. For example, a profit of 20-30% for works of industry or  an
income of, say,  510  times  the  statutory  minimum  wage  for  individual
artists, on average since first publication, seems  reasonable.  It  is  my
understanding that Germany already has  similar  regulations  where  public
procurement is concerned.
After the author/publisher makes this much from monetising  a  work  (which
would include income from merchandising, live performances, public  funding
etc.  etc.),  exclusive  distribution  and  derivation  rights  granted  by
copyright should expire, and the work should essentially enter  the  public
domain. Additionally, the copyright monopoly should  also  expire  after  a
fixed term of, say, 20 years after first publication unless  the  copyright
holder can convincingly show that they need an extension in order to make a
living (as  opposed  to  just  making  a  profit).  This  would  provide  a
reasonable upper limit on the duration of the copyright monopoly while also
allowing genuinely unsuccessful artists to keep trying  to  monetise  their
work. An absolute maximum duration is also needed; 10 years after the death
of the last living author of a work seems reasonable in almost  all  cases.
(I  suppose  there  might  be  some  corner  cases  that  warrant   special
treatment.)

          The effects of a mandatory copyright registration regime
Having to register creative works in order to obtain  copyright  protection
for them would make copyright work more like patent law, and introduce many
of the same problems into copyright.
Let us consider the position of various players separately.
Professional creative entity (e.g. writer, music publisher etc.) in the EU:
obtaining copyright protection for new works  is  routine.  There  is  some
associated cost which either decreases profits slightly or is passed on  to
endusers. There is no tangible benefit for original works; it  justs  costs
more to obtain the same protection they are awarded now.
An advantage manifests if the work is not (wholly) original:  the  work  of
amateurs who have failed to register their copyright can be re-used easily.
The cost of creating semi-original works decreases.
Professional  creative  entity  outside  the  EU:  either  the   EU   keeps
recognising foreign copyrights without registration, in which  case  non-EU
authors are put at  a  slight  advantage  because  they  receive  copyright
protection automatically while domestic creators have to file paperwork  to
get it; or the EU requires foreign creators to also register in  order  for
their rights to be enforceable in the EU. I imagine the  latter  would  not
play well with the US, in addition to being  incompatible  with  the  Berne
Convention; additionally, what if every country in the world started  doing
this?  Suddenly  you'd  have  to  register  your  copyright  in  dozens  of
jurisdictions; maybe the Cayman Islands  would  make  it  so  difficult  or
expensive to register there that almost nobody could do it  (maybe  require
permanent residence?), and an offshore "piracy"  business  would  flourish,
etc. etc. So I suppose requiring foreigners  to  register  is  out  of  the
question; but then, why should domestic creators have a harder time of it?
Copyright troll: depending on how exactly the legislation is worded,  maybe
a new kind of copyright trolling would become profitable: find unregistered
(and thus "de facto public domain") works, perhaps alter them in  minuscule
ways if necessary, register the copyright, then sue the original author and
anyone else who published it. No thanks; copyright already lends itself  to
certain kinds of trolling (like threatening file-sharers with legal  action
unless they pay up). Instead of giving parasites  more  ways  of  making  a
profit, we should try to give them less.
Semi-professional creator of not-for-profit works: suddenly it's no  longer
enough to slap a Creative Commons license on your works to ensure they stay
free. If you don't register your copyright (which costs time  and  probably
also money), someone can produce a derived work and  make  it  proprietary.
This is an  even  greater  problem  with  free  software:  any  proprietary
software manufacturer could start adding proprietary extensions to e.g. GPL
licensed software, and the license would no longer be able to  protect  the
rights of the users because it would be unenforceable unless  the  original
author registers their copyright. What if there are  hundreds  of  authors?
(This can easily be the case with large open source projects.) Do they  all
have to register? Either way, copyright registration would  be  a  disaster
for free software and  a  major  inconvenience  for  the  authors  of  not-
forprofit works; certainly fewer such works would  be  published,  and  the
public would be poorer for it.
Amateur: you post a holiday photo, or a picture  of  your  cat  or  kid  on
Facebook, not thinking/knowing you have to do anything  to  stop  companies
from using these pictures as they see fit. Such pictures are  harvested  by
companies en masse and get added to stock photo collections, then  used  in
advertising. Your kid could end  up  being  on  billboards  advertising  an
alleged remedy for some awkward medical condition etc. Not good.


On the whole,  it  appears  that  mandatory  copyright  registration  would
chiefly benefit creators of certain classes of derivative works  and  would
be detrimental to the legitimate interests of everyone else.

               What is, and what is not a public performance?
It is my understanding that in at least  some  member  states  of  the  EU,
publishers  have  attempted  and  partly  succeeded  in  defining   "public
performance" of music so broadly  that  even  the  music  a  private  phone
exchange plays while the client waits to be connected qualifies, as well as
ringtones of mobile phones. In the USA, a rights management outfit sort  of
attempted to collect royalties for campfire songs sung by girl scouts  (see
e.g.  http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/17/nyregion/ascap-asks-royalties-from-
girl-scouts-and-regrets-it.html). I'm actually surprised  that  it's  still
legal to whistle popular tunes, without  paying  royalties,  while  walking
along a street[52].
I think the law should define "public performance" in a much narrower  way.
Additionally, "performers" who are not paid for a "performance" should  not
have  to  pay  royalties.  I  realise  this  gets  complicated  when   free
performances of music are used to promote a later paid-for performance,  or
when payment is not rendered directly for the performance but in a  fashion
connected to it somehow, etc. Nevertheless, private individuals should  not
normally have to consider paying  royalties  when  they  sing  or  play  an
instrument as a hobby, even if they do this for some value of "publicly".

                         Public funds, public domain
If the public pays for the creation of a work, it is  only  fair  that  the
public should be able to use the resulting work as freely  as  possible.  I
think works produced using public financing (to an  extent  of,  say,  more
than 15%) should be in the public domain (the US  has  a  similar  policy).
This would include the text of laws; all  kinds  of  reports  published  by
public agencies or governmental organisations; the text of court decisions;
the minutes of parliament; standards published by publicly funded standards
bodies; TV and radio programmes  paid  for  by  the  taxpayer;  news  items
published by the government-run news agency; the web  pages  of  government
bodies and public institutions; software  written  by  or  for  the  public
sector; and so on.
For example, in Hungary, the Academy of Sciences (which  of  course  mostly
operates from public funding) drafted a new version of a set of  rules  for
Hungarian  spelling  a  few  months  ago,  and  attempted   to   stop   its
dissemination by claiming a copyright on it. I believe this  is  wrong  and
shouldn't be allowed to happen. Likewise, if an internal memo of a  corrupt
government agency is leaked by a whistleblower, the agency  should  not  be
able to sue the newspapers that publish it for copyright infringement.  And
so on.
I'm not saying all works created using public funding should  automatically
be published, just that they should not be copyrighted. It should still  be
possible  to  classify  them  or  just  refrain  from  publishing  them  if
necessary; but once they are public, they should be free to copy and use.
Additionally, I believe that software written by or for the  public  sector
should always be open source in addition to being in the public domain  (or
licensed under a  strong  copyleft  license),  because  that  provides  the
greatest benefit to the public. A good definition for software written "for
the public sector' is needed to avoid having to make all software  used  by
the public sector open source (although that would also have  benefits,  it
would cause lobbyist outcry); a possible approach would be to check whether
the software has a significant number of paying customers  in  the  private
sector, or whether it was made to order from the public sector etc.
As noted above, instead of such works being in the public domain, it  would
be even better to have them copyrighted but licensed under a  strong,  free
license (such as CC-BY-SA  or  GPLv3).  Of  course,  legislation  shouldn't
mandate a specific license, just enumerate the main terms it must contain.
In particular, it is important that the public's  right  to  use  something
created using public financing isn't curbed by non-copyright rights of some
third party, for example trademarks or patents; in  the  case  of  patents,
whoever licenses the work for use  by  some  public  sector  entity  should
automatically also license it to members of the general public who use  the
publicly financed patented work (see GPLv3). In the case of trademarks, the
public should be allowed to use the trademark if and only if  doing  so  is
for some reason necessary to benefit from the publicly  financed  work;  if
not, the public can always create a derived work that doesn't infringe  the
trademark.


Software procurement by the public sector
As noted eariler, I think software written specifically  or  primarily  for
the public sector should be either in the public domain, or licensed  under
a strong open source license like the GPLv3.
However, in addition to that, I think  it  would  be  beneficial  if,  when
procuring software, the public sector would insist on favourable  copyright
license terms in addition to specific features, support etc. In particular,
it should insist on receiving the source code  as  well  as  the  right  to
modify and distribute the  software.  This  doesn't  prejudice  proprietary
software vendors because they are also free to provide their products under
such licenses; they just typically choose not to.
Such legislation exists in at least  Peru,  and  Peruvian  congressman  Dr.
Edgar David Villaneuva Nuñez made a very persuasive case for it  before  it
was passed; see e.g.   http://opensource.org/docs/peru_and_ms.php for
an English translation.
The benefits to the public would be manifold:
1. In case the original vendor of the  software  goes  out  of  business  or
   otherwise becomes uncooperative, it would still be possible  to  continue
   development and support of the software, eliminating the need to purchase
   a new solution at great cost.
2. The source code could be audited in a crowd-sourced  fashion,  at  little
to no cost to the public sector.

3. Interoperability would be guaranteed by making  interface  specifications
as well as implementation details
   public.
4. Competition would be spurned in the services  sector,  because  not  only
   the original vendor would be able to provide the highest level of support
   for the product.

                         Rights management agencies
The way common rights management agencies currently work  is  fraught  with
controversy. For example, in some  cases,  not-for-profit  performances  of
free music (either freely licensed  or  public  domain)  are  charged  with
copyright enforcement  fees  that  are  then  redistributed  to  commercial
performers or publishers; this must stop. Likewise, artists  are  currently
disincentivised from releasing their works for free  download  because  (at
least in Hungary) the rights  management  outfit  still  wants  to  collect
license fees from them for each copy. It is  also  unnecessarily  (probably
unreasonably) difficult to unsubscribe from the  common  rights  management
system, especially en masse.
Another area where these outfits tend to  receive  justified  criticism  is
lack of transparency. I think copyright levies built  into  the  prices  of
commercial goods, as well as royalties collected by the agencies, should be
regarded as a form of taxation; proceeds should be accounted for completely
transparently, with public oversight. Additionally, while I understand  the
desire to "reimburse" commercially successful artists for supposed "losses"
incurred due to "illegal" copying, I also think there are several important
points which are currently ignored:
a) it's far from certain that works that are  more  successful  commercially
are also copied more;

b) an  "illegal"  copy  does  not  equal  a  lost  sale  (contrary  to  what
publishers commonly claim);
c) having the most successful artists/publishers  benefit  from  the  levies
   instead of using them to help finance commercially less successful art is
   not in the public  interest.  The  commercially  successful  artists  are
   already making a living; it would be better to use the levies to  promote
   or finance art that has yet to (or will likely never) become commercially
   successful, and/or art distributed under free licenses.
Remember: all legislative decisions related to copyright should  always  be
in the public interest. Copyright is not (or at  least  should  not  be)  a
fundamental right; it is an arbitrary construct designed to induce  artists
to create and publish works of art for the public benefit.
In some instances, common rights management outfits like  GEMA  in  Germany
are actively stifling the dissemination of culture[53]. For  example,  many
YouTube videos that are freely viewable in the rest of the world have  been
"Gema'd" (as Internet slang calls it) in Germany: German viewers can't  see
them unless they resort to workarounds (of course, GEMA is trying to  shift
the blame; see e.g. <http://torrentfreak.com/youtube-ordered-
to-remove-illegal-copyright-blocking-notices-140226/>). This results in  no
benefit to anyone (other than commercial VPN providers):
1. It is highly doubtful that this practice increases "legal" sales  of  the
   affected works. I think the opposite is likely true, as people who  don't
   know the affected songs/videos will not get to know them and so will  not
   buy  them,  or  other  records  of  the  musicians.  Sony  Music  CEO  of
   International    Business    seems    to    agree    with     me;     see
   <http://torrentfreak.com/sony-music-boss-censored-youtube-videos-cost-us-
   millions-120224/>.
2. In other  words,  GEMA  reduces  the  visibility  of  the  artists  whose
interests it is supposedly representing;
3. It doesn't take much to circumvent the GEMA filter  by  using  a  foreign
   proxy or VPN, so that a person determined to "violate the rights  of  the
   artist" can easily do so, rendering the measure largely ineffective;
4. The German public's access to culture is diminished (Germans are  put  at
   a disadvantage compared to most of the rest of the world);
5. Members of the public who decide to  circumvent  the  GEMA  filter  waste
   resources by doing work that shouldn't be necessary in the  first  place;
   the work carried out by GEMA and Google  (YouTube)  is  also  essentially
   wasted.
6. YouTube is under pressure to filter more  broadly  than  necessary  (even
   GEMA acknowledges this) because it wants to avoid infringments  it  could
   be held liable for; the result is that even videos whose availability  in
   Germany GEMA would not have legal grounds to object to are filtered.
I realise the point could be made that Google would  unfairly  profit  from
disseminating these copyrighted works without paying the musicians, but the
end result of the quabble is not that the musicians  get  paid  but  rather
that the general public is denied access to culture while the musicians get
less exposure.
I do not know for a fact whether this is the case, but I can  well  imagine
that individual musicians are unable to have the GEMA filter  bypassed  for
their own music, so that even if they would like to use YouTube to  promote
their music without receiving payments  from  YouTube,  they  can't  do  so
unless GEMA cooperates. Thus everyone loses.

                             The YouTube problem
The problem with YouTube in particular is a difficult one. Every one of the
following factors is important to consider:
    • Google is making a profit by selling advertisements that are displayed
      alongside the videos.
    • Google doesn't pay the creators of the videos if it can avoid it.  The
      creators explicitly agree to this when they upload their videos.
    • YouTube plays an  important  role  in  disseminating  culture  to  the
      public, including a  vast  quantity  of  original  "content"  actually
      created by the people who upload it. These people decide to make their
      videos available to others for free  but  typically  can't  host  them
      themselves.
    • Google/YouTube doesn't charge the viewers for access to the videos.
    • At the rate videos are being uploaded to YouTube, there is no feasible
      way of making sure that the  uploaders  own  the  necessary  copyright
      licenses to publish what they're uploading.  While  automatic  content
      recognition helps, it will make mistakes; in particular it will not be
      able to decide whether something is fair use or not.
    • A substantial amount of YouTube videos  consist  mostly  of  "pirated"
      material (e.g. a popular song with a  video  stream  consisting  of  a
      sequence of barely relevant still images). There are also  many  mash-
      ups  and  other  kinds  of  works  derived  from  copyright  protected
      originals.
    • It is unclear whether the artists whose  "content"  gets  uploaded  to
      YouTube "illegally" make  more  or  less  money  as  a  result.  (It's
      possible that the increased exposure helps them generate more  revenue
      by other means; but it's also conceivable that their ability  to  sell
      copies of their works diminishes.)
    • It is unclear whether the publishers of this content make more or less
      money as a result of it being available on YouTube. (Sony Music  seems
      to think they make more; see <http://torrentfreak.com/sony- music-boss-
      censored-youtube-videos-cost-us-millions-120224/>   and   the   linked
      interviews with Sony Music executive.)


    • Google does not market the YouTube service as a means of  distributing
      copies of digital works without permission from the authors. Its  non-
      infringing use is substantial  (depending  on  how  you  look  at  it,
      probably much larger in volume than the infringing use).
    • Google does not incentivise its users to commit copyright infringement
      (e.g. by paying them for uploading popular videos).
    • Making available for streaming and making available for  download  are
      technologically the same. A client application  can  turn  a  download
      into a stream or a stream into a download. The service provider has no
      control over this as long as general purpose computers exist[54].
    • It seems unfair to put outfits like GEMA into a  position  where  they
      can decide that some videos should be unavailable in a country -  e.g.
      by charging unrealistic amounts for their licensing. It even occurs to
      me that they might influence the market by e.g. charging  Google  more
      than some competing service, or vice versa.
Publishers and rights management agencies believe that Google should either
pay them for the "infringing" "content" YouTube users  upload  (and  Google
profits  from  indirectly)  or  take  these  videos  down,  or  make   them
unavailable in certain georgraphical regions (as if the Internet recognised
borders), or some combination of these. "Infringing" is  typically  defined
very  broadly,  with  little  or  no  regard  for  fair   use   (see   e.g.
<http://torrentfreak.com/lawrence-lessig-wins-damages-for-bogus-youtube-
takedown-140228> for a higher than usual profile case where a publisher had
something taken down even though it was fair use).
Several questions arise:
1. Should Google be paying anybody? (e.g. the video creators;  the  artists;
the publishers; the rights management agencies; the Holy See etc.)
2. If yes, who should determine how much Google  should  pay?  (e.g.  market
forces; publishers; legislators; rights management agencies; etc.)
3. What factors should be considered when deciding how  much  Google  should
pay? (E.g. flat annual fee; or a flat fee per video;  or  a  flat  fee  per
view; or some fraction of the advertising revenue; or maybe there should be
more expensive and less expensive videos; etc.)
There is no immediately obvious "right" solution. It does seem unethical to
allow Google to profit from the work of others without permission, even  if
only indirectly; then again, maybe it's a win-win situation and the  artist
who is being "ripped off' is actually being promoted at no  cost  to  them?
(Surely this is the reason why many artists upload their own  "content"  to
YouTube.) It also feels wrong - anachronistic - that Google should be  made
to implement geographic restrictions on "content", or that GEMA  should  be
allowed to dictate how much money Google has to pay in order to be  allowed
to show videos to Germans.
Since there appears to be no solution  that's  obviously  right,  maybe  we
should instead consider what changes to the legal landscape would make  the
problem moot.
If Google were explicitly not liable for the  behaviour  of  its  users  (a
strengthening of "safe harbour" provisions eroded by court rulings such  as
this  one:   <http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-20/google-s-youtube-
must-help-detect-illegal-uploads-court-says>), the problem would change but
it wouldn't go away. Instead of demanding royalties from Google,  GEMA  and
their ilk would issue mass takedown notices to get  "infringing"  "content"
removed, with no regard for fair use. They may even try  to  prosecute  the
individuals who uploaded  the  videos  in  question.  This  is  costly  for
everyone concerned and there is no clear  benefit  to  anyone  (other  than
lawyers).
Nevertheless, I believe legislation would be  necessary  to  clearly  state
what measures a provider like Google has to take  to  avoid  liability  for
copyright infringement perpetrated by its users. Major  commercial  players
with significant market power, like YouTube, can be  expected  to  do  more
than small-time or not-for-profit ones.
Another - quite radical - approach would be to declare  digital  copies  of
published audiovisual material to have no worth and not be covered  by  the
exclusivity  of  the  author's  right  to  copy.  While  this  would   have
advantages, in the specific case  of  YouTube  it  wouldn't  help,  because
people not only share straight-up copies of protected  "content"  but  also
derivative works.


To legalise those as well, it would be necessary  to  declare  the  private,
not-for-profit production of derivative works  fair  use,  and  award  these
derivative works a degree  of  copyright  protection  (certainly  enough  to
allow the creator to license them to Google/YouTube).
Another - and perhaps the simplest - possibility would be to  raise  royalty
levies on sites like YouTube like on digital media. After  all,  it  doesn't
seem feasible to identify which  specific  videos  possibly  infringe  whose
copyrights; taking down infringing videos is fraught with problems (such  as
adjudicating whether something is fair use); maybe it's best to have  Google
pay some fraction of its advertising revenue to rights  management  agencies
like GEMA and be done with all copyright claims. It should  however  be  the
legislature who decides what fraction of the  advertising  revenue  services
like YouTube have to pay, not the collecting  agencies.  (Of  course,  there
are many important details: like  deciding  which  country  or  geographical
region is responsible for how much ad revenue; or whether to consider  other
revenue channels etc.) This approach would eliminate the haggling over  per-
view rates that led to the current controversy in Germany, and it would  put
neither GEMA nor Google into an unfairly strong position.
It is important that such levies be a fraction of the revenue  generated  by
the site and not some lump sum, so that not-for-profit services are viable.

                             Online enforcement
Online copyright enforcement frequently conflicts with basic  human  rights.
The  right  to  privacy  is  laid  down  in  Article  12  of  the  Universal
Declaration of Human Rights as well as Articles 7 and 8 of  the  Charter  of
Fundamental Rights of the  European  Union.  Copyright  is  not  universally
understood to be a fundamental right (and neither should it be);  therefore,
any measures that aim to protect or enforce  it  cannot  conflict  with  any
fundamental rights[55].
In an online context, for  example  where  peer  to  peer  file  sharing  is
concerned, copyright enforcement necessarily has to involve  differentiating
between "legal" and "illegal" transmissions. The publishing lobby is  trying
to get either ISPs or authorities to inspect all transmissions (in order  to
block "illegal" ones and/or persecute the people  who  allegedly  engage  in
"illegal" communication), which would violate the right to privacy. This  is
in addition to all the  practical  problems  of  mis-identifying  infringing
transmissions,  prosecuting  the  wrong  individuals,  the   potential   for
copyright  trolling  as  done  by,  for  example,  Prenda  Law   (see   e.g.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenda_Law), and so on.
As  things  currently  stand,  online  enforcement  is  costly   (with   the
publishers in whose sole interest it  takes  place  naturally  unwilling  to
foot the bill) and also highly ineffective.  As  a  person  with  a  PhD  in
network security I don't think there is any reason to  expect  a  change  on
either  count  (other  researchers  tend  to  agree  with   me;   see   e.g.
http://msl1.mit.edu/ESD10/docs/darknet5.pdf). "Illegal" private  copying  of
copyrighted        works        is         rampant         (see         e.g.
http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/apr/07/digitalmusic.drm) and  can
be expected to stay so. Ramping up penalties  changes  nothing  (as  studies
have  shown);  three-strikes  measures  are  also  ineffective   (see   e.g.
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2380522).   Technological
measures to curb "piracy" are and will be  ineffective  as  well.  And  most
importantly, the battle  against  private  copying  is  not  in  the  public
interest (it is likely not even in the interest  of  artists,  just  in  the
perceived interest of publishers); therefore, it should stop  and  certainly
not receive public funding or legislative support.
The public shouldn't have to perceive  copyright  as  someone's  ability  to
stop people sharing interesting things with each other.

                             Automatic filtering
Automatic filtering of "infringing" content is  causing  problems  for  uses
that are legal even under the current regime. On  the  one  hand,  see  e.g.
<https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/09/copyrights-robot-wars-heat-
algorithms-block-live-streams-first-and-ask-questions>  for  a  high-profile
case where automatic copyright enforcement filters blocked  perfectly  legal
live streams of an event; on the other hand, automatic filters can never  be
expected to recognise instances of fair use, so that  they  are  necessarily
overbroad with typically little recourse left for  the  end  user.  If  such
filters were to become the norm, fair use (which is in the public  interest)
would take a great hit in order to protect  the  private  interests  of  the
publishing industry.
I would like such automatic filters to be  strictly  regulated  even  if  no
other changes to copyright law are made; for example, it should be  possible
to have any filter affecting a live stream lifted promptly (as well as  have
the stream cleared in advance); it should  be  possible  for  end  users  to
contest filtering decisions with a minimum of
effort on fair use grounds; operators of filters with a high false  positive
rate should be required to fix their filters in addition  to  paying  fines;
etc. The private interests of the  publishers  are  almost  irrelevant;  all
legislation  should  serve  the  public  interest  (and  serve  the  private
interests of the publishers only  to  the  extent  this  itself  serves  the
public interest).
YouTube seems to have made deals with some record labels that  allow  these
labels to have content removed from YouTube even  if  the  content  is  not
infringing their  copyright  (e.g.  because  it  is  fair  use);  see  e.g.
<http://torrentfreak.com/youtube-deal-with-universal-blocks-dmca-counter-
notices-130405/>. I believe such deals should be illegal;  fair  use  needs
more protection from arbitrary censorship by copyright holders.

                           "Intellectual property"
The EU should make a point of avoiding referring to copyright, patents  and
trademarks collectively as "intellectual property", because this gives  the
impression that there is a fundamental  similarity  between  the  right  to
private property and copyright (as well as between copyright, patent  right
and trademarks), whereas in fact there is none. The right to  own  property
is a fundamental human right (recognised in Article  17  of  the  Universal
Declaration of Human Rights). Copyright is  not,  which  is  why  copyright
protection, as well as patents,  can  and  indeed  should  expire  after  a
certain time (also see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html). If they
can expire, they cannot be fundamental  rights;  how  could  a  fundamental
right expire?
Unfortunately, "intellectual property" is mentioned in the  EU  charter  of
fundamental rights, so that  the  term,  misleading  as  it  is,  would  be
difficult to get rid of even if the will to do  so  were  to  exist.  Alas,
having the EU protect "intellectual property" at the same level it protects
the right to fundamental human rights recognised everywhere  (also  by  the
UN) seems to suggest that in the EU, copyright is not  subordinate  to,  or
derived from, the public interest, which puts the European public in a much
worse position than the American public.
Thankfully, Article 17 of the EU charter  only  states  that  "intellectual
property shall be protected" and doesn't go as far as claiming that it is a
fundamental right. Care must be taken to avoid further eroding the role  of
the public interest in copyright legislation.
There is no need for the laws governing trademarks, patents  and  copyright
to be similar to each other (which is what lumping  them  together  into  a
single category suggests) or to the laws governing real property (which  is
what calling "intellectual property" "property" insinuates). It would be  a
great step forward if the charter could be amended, in  due  time,  to  say
"Copyright, trademarks and patents shall be protected to the extent this is
in the public interest".

                      Publishers are becoming obsolete
The way publishers currently do business can be summed up as follows:
1. Select creative works that are likely to be commercially successful.
2. Create many copies.
3. Promote the works.
4. Sell the copies.
5. Profit.
6. Optionally: pay the author of the published work.
Step 6 is optional because the authors of works in the public domain  don't
need to be paid, but also because in many cases publishers  don't  pay  the
authors at all (for example, if record sales are not high enough, the music
label typically keeps all proceeds).
This business model depends on the ability to sell copies, which depends on
copies having value.
In today's increasingly digital world, copies have less and less  intrinsic
value because the effort required to create and  store  perfect  copies  is
diminishing. Publishers are trying to  maintain  the  value  of  copies  by
pushing for legislation that makes it illegal (as  well  as  harder,  using
DRM) for the general public to make their own copies. This is  somewhat  as
if e.g. apple tree owners were expecting the legislature to make it illegal
for other people to plant the seeds of the apples they buy, as well  as  to
spend public funds enforcing this prohibition.
Publishing in the conventional sense is rapidly becoming obsolete as  cheap
and efficient online distribution channels become available  to  individual
artists. The middle man isn't really needed anymore (or soon won't be,  for
many branches of publishing); I strongly believe it would be wrong  to  use
legislation to prop up a business
                                                                          47

model our civilisiation has surpassed technologically. The public stands to
benefit greatly from the digital age: access to culture is becoming  easier
by the minute; the publishers no longer have the power to dictate what gets
published at all; and while it is now arguably more difficult  for  authors
to become spectacularly rich than,  say,  30  years  ago,  I  believe  more
authors can now make a decent living by selling directly to  the  end  user
instead of supporting a middleman than 30 years ago. This belief  seems  to
be       corroborated       by       studies       such       as       e.g.
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/37406039/Thesis-Bjerkoe-Sorbo>.
The  music  business  in  particular  is  changing.  Whereas  earlier  live
performances were seen as promoting record sales, now the opposite is  true
(see   e.g.    http://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/06/09/rasmus-fleischer/the-
future-of- copyright/): recordings, which are copies, have almost no worth,
but a live performance is uncopiable and unrepeatable; experiencing  it  is
therefore valuable. This is also reflected in  the  findings  of  Peter  C.
DiCola,            among            others;            see             e.g.
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2199058   ("Money   from
Music: Survey Evidence on Musicians' Revenue and  Lessons  About  Copyright
Incentives"): only about 6% of a musician's income comes from record sales.
Thus, even if musicians made no money from selling recorded music, it would
barely affect their total income. Clearly it is a fallacy to  pretend  that
preventing the private copying of music is a vital  interest  of  musicians
(it is only a vital interest of music publishers).
When blacksmiths and fletchers became largely obsolete, legislators  didn't
step in to make alternatives to these trades illegal, or  to  cross-finance
affected craftsmen ("stakeholders"[56]) from the income of other craftsmen.
I don't think publishers merit special treatment either.

Self-serving legal action
Publishers routinely sue people for copyright infringement  (or  even  just
"facilitating" it). However, even when the plaintiffs  collect  substantial
amount of money, that money is not, as a rule, used  to  actually  pay  any
artist  (see  e.g.  <https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-loot-with-artists-
120728/>). Instead, the money is  used  to  fund  more  lawsuits  or  anti-
"piracy" campaigns, i.e. for the own purposes of the publishing industry.
I believe that when a defendant is ordered by a court to pay damages  as  a
consequence of copyright infringement, that money should be used to support
art directly - either by giving it to  the  artist(s)  or  author(s)  whose
copyright was violated (especially if a "copyleft" license was  violated  -
after all, the author is labouring in the public interest in this case, and
it appears fair to support them  financially  using  funds  recovered  from
parties who sought to unlawfully deprive the public of the benefit of their
labour), or  by  transferring  it  into  a  cultural  fund.  It  should  be
impossible for artists/authors to enter  into  agreements  with  publishers
that would grant publishers custody of such awards. As a  rule,  it  should
not be more profitable for publishers to litigate than to publish, in order
to eliminate copyright trolling.

                                     DRM
DRM stands for "Digital Rights  Management"  and  refers  to  a  family  of
technological measures intended, broadly, to make it more difficult to make
perfect copies of a digital work, and to restrict how people  can  use  the
copies they have obtained (by whatever means). In the USA, as well  as  the
EU, circumventing DRM is a crime. This has the unfortunate consequence that
companies get to introduce arbitrary restrictions on  the  use  of  digital
media and have those restrictions enforced by the power of  law;  see  e.g.
http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/feb/05/digital-rights-
management:
     "Ever since Reimerdes [Universal City Studios, Inc v Reimerdes,  2000],
     it's been clear that DRM isn't the right to prevent  piracy:  it's  the
     right to make up your own copyright laws. The right  to  invent  things
     that people aren't allowed to do - even though the law permits it - and
     to embed these  prohibitions  in  code  that  is  illegal  to  violate.
     Reimerdes also showed us that DRM is the right to suppress speech:  the
     right to stop people from uttering code or keys or other expressions if
     there is some chance that these utterances  will  interfere  with  your
     made-up copyright laws."
I think it should be elected legislators, not companies who decide what end-
users are allowed to do or not.
The  DMCA  has   many   well   documented   harmful   effects;   see   e.g.
<https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended- consequences-under-dmca>. For  example,
it paradoxically makes  it  illegal  to  reverse  engineer  DRM  encumbered
software       to        prove        license        violations;        see
<http://www.flora.ca/documents/drm-abuse.html>.
The US is trying to use international  "free  trade"  treaties  to  try  to
insinuate even stricter regulations into the laws of  other  nations.  ACTA
was one such attempt; CETA (see <https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/ceta-
 replicates-acta>); TTIP and the Trans-Pacific Partnership are now  another
- see e.g.


http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/trade-deal-could-be-
bitter-medicine-20131113- 2xh4p.html or
<https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/08/tpp-creates-liabilities-isps-and-put-
your-rights-risk> (although of course copyright enforcement is/was by far
not the only provision of these treaties). This is a matter in which I
expect the EU to stand fast against pressure from the US. We don't need the
US entertainment industry dictating our laws.
DRM has a track record of creating  interoperability  problems  (there  are
many  high-profile,  well-documented  usability   disasters),   introducing
security holes (see e.g. the infamous Sony rootkit), inhibiting legal  uses
of copyrighted content, trespassing on fair use rights etc. While it  would
probably be excessive to ban DRM,  it  should  not  be  awarded  any  legal
protection and the damage it can  do  should  be  statutorily  limited.  It
should be illegal for DRM mechanisms to inhibit  legal  uses  and  restrict
fair use rights; publishers of infringing DRM encumbered content should  be
required to reimburse users and pay statutory fines  to  discourage  future
infringements. This should be seen as a form of  consumer  protection:  DRM
encumbered goods are "defective by design"  in  the  sense  that  they  are
deliberately making it harder for users to use them, even  in  cases  where
the intended use is legal even under the  current  regime.  This  way,  DRM
currently actually acts as an incentive to obtain unlicensed copies instead
of licensed ones, simply  because  those  are  less  painful  to  use.  For
example, in 2008 Electronic Arts released a game called "Spore" that, in an
attempt to curtail "privacy", prevented paying customers from installing it
more than three times, ever. Less than  a  day  after  its  publication,  a
cracked version appeared that could be  installed  as  many  times  as  the
"pirates" wanted, so that even people who had paid for the  game  preferred
the cracked version. See e.g.
<http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/10/spore_drm_amazon_effect/>.
There are many documented cases of high profile DRM abuse. Examples include
the case when in 2005, Sony BMG sold audio CDs that  installed  malware  on
computers     the     CDs      were      played      back      on      (see
<http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/16/sony_bmg_rootkit_still_widespread/>
); when in 2009, copies of Orwell's "1984" were remotely deleted from the e-
book readers of people who had bought the book - along with any notes  they
had taken  (see  <http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jul/17/amazon-
kindle-1984>); Microsoft was, for the time being, forced to back out  of  a
DRM policy where they would have made it very difficult  to  sell  or  lend
purchased Xbox One games (see
<http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/19/xbox-one-drm-second-hand-
restrictions-abandoned>); and, in December 2013, Disney temporarily
prevented people from watching movies they had purchased in order to
increase its pay TV revenues (see <http://boingboing.net/2013/12/15/amazon-
takes-away-access-to-pu.html>).
DRM is also used by companies to create  artificial  incompatibilities  and
thus vendor lock-in; for example, to make sure music  can  only  be  played
back on specific types of playback equipment (sold by the same company that
sells the music). See e.g. <http://en.windows7sins.org/drm/> and the  other
pages it links to. I believe this practice should  be  either  illegal,  or
circumventing  it  (removing  DRM  in  the   interest   of   cross-platform
compatibility) should be explicitly legal.
DRM as it exists today on products already sold will not change to  reflect
changes in laws (especially changes that grant the end  users  more  rights
than before). It will also not expire when the copyright term  of  the  DRM
encumbered work expires. This is wrong. Again, the legislature should  have
more authority in these matters than corporations.

                  A possible business model for publishing
It seems clear to me that the current business model of publishing is
doomed in the medium term; but what alternatives are there?
In this section I propose a model that perhaps merits thinking about.
A writer wants to get paid for writing, but instead we currently have the
readers pay for reading. This seems backwards.
In proposing an alternative, I'm working from the following premises:
1. Authors of creative works need to be able to make a living.
2. The public wants to be allowed to copy creative works.
3. It is impossible to prevent copying of works that can be represented
   digitally without resorting to overbroad, totalitarian measures (and it
   may not be possible even then).
4. Natural scarcity of a commodity that is in  demand  motivates  people  to
pay for that commodity.


A creative work that can be represented digitally is only scarce before  it
is first published. After publication, an arbitrary number of copies can be
made at a vanishingly small cost. Therefore, one  of  the  motivations  for
paying - scarcity - is eliminated by the act of publication.
Currently, the end users typically don't pay the author to produce creative
works. Instead, some publisher pays the author and the end  users  pay  the
publisher for the privilege of being granted a copy. The publisher  uses  a
portion of its profits to pay future authors. Authors  need  publishers  to
provide them with a less erratic cash-flow than if they were  dealing  with
end-users themselves. This also has the  side  effect  of  causing/allowing
publishers to control the supply of culture.
This model is crumbling because publishers - allegedly  -  find  themselves
unable to sell a sufficient number of copies due to  the  large  volume  of
private copying. Assuming this is really the case, it follows that  payment
for new works is best collected before publication (and not necessarily  by
the publisher).
A successful system to collect pledges of monetary support already  exists:
crowdfunding, as done by e.g. kickstarter.com. The idea is that a person or
organisation that wishes to undertake a project (for example, write a  book
or develop a video game) posts a proposal and names a budget: the amount of
money required to make the project worthwhile  to  them.  Others  can  then
pledge whatever sum they are willing to spend to help fund the project.  If
the sum of the pledged amounts exceeds the target, the  money  is  actually
collected from the supporters and transferred to the pledgee who  can  then
start their project.
Once the work is complete, it is free to copy  (the  distribution  monopoly
granted by copyright need not apply because the reason for  it  -  allowing
the creator to make a living from their work - is no longer valid).
The advantages over the traditional publishing model are clear:
1. The creator is guaranteed to either receive  enough  money  to  fund  the
project before even starting work on the project, or to know with certainty
by a fixed deadline that sufficient funding is not available.
2. The public gets to copy the work as much as they want.
3. It is no longer necessary  to  waste  money  and  effort  on  prosecuting
people who copy the work privately, because private copying  is  explicitly
allowed.
Of course, I realise this model would not work for all copyrightable works.
Authors who are not well known  would  have  a  harder  time  of  gathering
support; culturally valuable but relatively unpopular art  would  still  be
difficult to finance.
It is not clear whether legislation is necessary to  enable  this  business
model; however, there are some aspects that lend themselves to a degree  of
regulation. For example, public cultural funds could pledge  contributions;
or, it might be possible to set up a  system  of  "hidden  pledges",  where
sufficient public funds are allocated to  start  a  particularly  appealing
project but this is not made clear until  the  deadline,  so  that  private
individuals and companies are still motivated to enter pledges. If there is
still not enough money when the deadline expires, public funding  steps  in
and covers what is still necessary (perhaps up to a fixed sum and  a  fixed
proportion of all financing). Naturally, such public financing  would  have
to be decided on transparently, by  a  nonpartisan,  independent  committee
with no conflicts of interest.
Additionally, perhaps fraud regulations have to be  updated  to  deal  with
authors who don't deliver what they were paid for.

                           International treaties
As noted above, corporations are trying to bypass  parliament  by  lobbying
for international "free trade" agreements that give them rights and  powers
at the expense of the rights of the general public.

I believe laws should be passed that prohibit the  EU  from  even  entering
into  negotiations  of  such  treaties  unless  some  criteria   are   met.
Transparency should be one such criterion; additionally, the EU  should  be
unable to ratify treaties that would require diminishing the rights  and/or
freedom of its citizens.

his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder's
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on  the  Computer  Programs  Directive.  It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[21]  For example,  it  does  not  affect  "domestic"  works  -  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[22]  On the basis of Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[23]   Plus  Directive  96/9/EC  on  the  legal  protection  of   databases;
Directive 2009/24/EC on the  legal  protection  of  computer  programs,  and
Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
[24]  Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the  Protection  of  Literary
and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of the TRIPS Agreement (Trade  Related
Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2)  of  the  WIPO  Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2)  of  the  WIPO  Copyright  Treaty
(1996).
[25]  Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of  minor  importance
for analogue uses existing in Member States at  the  time  of  adoption  of
Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
[26]  With the  exception  of  certain  limitations:  (i)  in  the  Computer
Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii)  Article  5(1)  in
the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
[27]  Only the exception established in the recent  Orphan  Works  Directive
(a mandatory exception to copyright and related rights  in  the  case  where
the rightholders are not known or  cannot  be  located)  has  been  given  a
crossborder effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary  work  -
for instance a novel - is considered an orphan work in a Member State,  that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States  and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.
[28]  Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.
[29]  Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.
[30]  Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.

commerce/mdex_en.htm .
[32]  France and Germany  have  already  adopted  legislation  to  back  the
effects of the MoU. The French  act  (LOI  n°  2012-287  du  1er  mars  2012
relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe  siècle)
foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher  in  question
opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption  of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are  not  members
of the collecting society.

[49]  For example when the infringing content is offered on a website  which
gets advertising revenues that depend on the volume of traffic.
[50]  This  clarification  should  not  affect  the  liability   regime   of
intermediary  service  providers  established  by  Directive  2000/31/EC  on
electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.
[51] An international copyright monopoly did not exist until the early  20th
   century, when the Berne  Convention  was  signed;  the  UK  didn't  fully
   implement it until 1988 and the  USA  didn't  sign  it  until  1989,  yet
   rightsholders inexplicably still got by.
[52] I mean, other people could hear! Someone who keeps pace with you may
   hear the entire piece ! And so could law enforcement listening through
   surveillance drones!
[53] As I understand it, the problem is that GEMA  wants  to  collect  money
   from Google (the owner of YouTube) per video per user; Google thinks  the
   amount sought is too high. GEMA sued Google  and  the  court  ruled  that
   YouTube had to make "infringing" content unavailable in Germany. Now GEMA
   would not like to be seen  as  being  responsible  for  this,  because  -
   predictably - it has become unpopular as a result.
[54] Outlawing general purpose computers (that are fully controlled by  the
   private individuals who buy  them)  in  order  to  enforce  a  difference
   between  streaming  and  downloading  would  be   a   good   example   of
   disproportionate, unnecessary and likely ineffective legislation  -  like
   so much that has been going on in the copyright arena lately.
[55] Although I note with dismay that the EU charter of fundamental rights
   does include mention of "intellectual property" in Article 17, as if it
   were the same as actual property; more on this later.
[56] Sometimes quite literally.
