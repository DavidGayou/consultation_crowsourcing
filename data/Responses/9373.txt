Introduction:
For publishers of newspapers and news media, an effective copyright protection is key to
securing the independent journalism, news and analysis that are fundamental elements of
any democracy. News media publishers must be able to rely on copyright protection to
ensure remuneration for their significant investment and for the sustainable delivery of the
high-value, quality, professional content they produce for Europe’s consumers and
businesses. This content – delivered in print and on a variety of digital platforms - represents
a vital contribution towards building a better-informed and engaged democratic society.


Press publishers need to be able to continue providing consumers with innovative,
professional content. For this to continue in a sustainable way, publishers need to monetise
content and it is thus paramount that more than ever in the digital era, that publishers should
continue to be able to decide on the terms and conditions for managing, distributing and
making available their content.




                                                                                              1
    I.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A.    Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in
Europe?
1.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which
you live?
2.     [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
3.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] How
often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the
sector and the type of content concerned.
Newspapers, in either print or digital format, are available via subscriptions and single copy
sales across borders. Access to newspaper content in digital formats, either paid-for access
or free, is available in all European countries. We therefore do not see any problems with
access to newspaper content across borders.
Newspaper publishers generally manage their rights (digital and analogue) on an individual
basis whenever feasible or possible. Sometimes it is decided that an RRO could better
manage these rights collectively.
The activities of newspapers, whether in print or digital, operate primarily at national, regional
and local level because this is largely where their market, including advertising and readers,
is located. Cross-border licensing is marginal compared to the national market. Publishers
report that requests for such licences for secondary uses of already published text and image
works only occur only occasionally, with the exception of requests for the licensing of the use
of images on websites and various e-products, where multi-territorial licences can represent
up to 25% of all licences. Nevertheless where such requests are made, publishers are
licensing their content across borders and no particular problems have been reported
regarding such multi-territory licensing.
It is important to underline that rightholders should always be able to decide on the territory
or territories which are the subject of a license. An EU-wide license should always be a
choice and never imposed. Furthermore, cultural issues are an area of national
competences, where subsidiarity should apply.
Nevertheless, to respond to any demand coming from external companies, publishers have
established joint press clipping services which provide licenses for the various uses of digital
works or which offer tailor-made services to different types of users on a commercial basis. In
respect of the type of rights administered by publishers and their RROs, no particular
problems have been reported regarding multi-territory licensing.
Multi-territorial licensing is the main objective of a project called PDLN (Press Database and
Licensing Network), established by publishers’ rights management organisations and press
database companies). At national level, various services and offers have been developed by
publishers to respond to these demands, either on an individual basis or jointly, for example
in Belgium (Mediargus and Pressbanking). The idea is also to take into account the needs of


                                                                                                2
international users (such as the EU institutions for instance) and provide standardised and
user-friendly solutions.
PDLN was founded in 2008 by companies from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
France, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Switzerland and UK. PDLN members currently represent
over 5.000 newspapers and magazines from 13 different countries. For more details see:
http://www.pdln.info/index.htm)


4.     If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above –
what would be the best way to tackle them?
We have not identified any problems for the press sector.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to
certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?
NO
The activities of newspapers, whether in print or digital, operate primarily at national, regional
and local level because this is largely where their market, including advertising and readers,
is located. Cross-border licensing is marginal compared to the national market. It is, however,
important to underline that rightholders should always be able to decide how to manage their
content.


6.      [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to
a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability
of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
protection for right holders?


  NO
As explained in the response to question 3, access to newspaper content in digital formats,
either paid-for access or free, is available across borders and in all European countries.
In addition, publishers have established joint press clipping services which provide licenses
for the various uses of digital works, or which offer tailor-made services to different types of
users on a commercial basis in cross-border situations.
Regarding multi-territorial licencing, the predominantly national nature of the press sector
should be duly taken into account. The management of rights is best dealt with at a national


                                                                                                3
  level due to its very strong effect on local languages and cultures. Any EU-wide initiative in
  this area should avoid a “one size fits all” solution that does not take full account of cultural
  differences, an enormous diversity of products and sectors (music, news media, books and
  the audiovisual), as well as the difficulty to establishing common rules in this area.
  In the news media sector, current legislation does not serve as an impediment to the
  development of multi-territorial solutions, which the European Commission itself has
  confirmed previously in its Reflection Document on “Creative Content in a European Digital
  Single Market: Challenges for the Future”, 22 October 2009: “The present legal framework
  does not in itself prevent rightholders from commercialising their works on a multi-territory
  basis” (Art 2, page 12). On the contrary, newspaper publishers are licensing their content to
  commercial users in order to make their content available across borders. Commercial users
  can generally license a work directly from the publisher or from a collecting society or press
  database to use it on a worldwide basis.



  B.     Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
  authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

1. The act of “making available”
  8.    Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e.
  when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
  YES
  Newspaper publishers are of the opinion that the re-use must continue to be subject to
  national rules in the territory where the communication is received and “re-used” as regards
  the relevant copyright-restricted acts. There is no need for legal clarification of the territorial
  scope of the “making available right.




  9.       [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
  of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
  whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to
  have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of
  rights (including the availability of injunctive relief1)?
  NO
  Country of origin principle would be completely against Art. 5 of the Berne Convention: Lex
  loci protectionis ("[the] law of the place where the protection is [claimed]"). This important
  principle together with today’s case law protects copyright adequately. The country of origin
  principle would be the end of all copyright protection in Europe.




  1
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent an infringement
  of his/her right.

                                                                                                                  4
2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


  10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
  rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
  download) create problems for you?
    NO
  Both the reproduction right and the making available right are necessary and complementary.
  They solve, rather than create, problems.



3. Linking and browsing


  11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
  protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
  subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES, under specific circumstances
  Publishers would like to reiterate that yes, under certain circumstances, it is protected.
  When links to newspaper content are posted with information, there is a real risk of diverting
  readers from the need to read further any relevant information on the newspaper websites as
  such. There is also a problem with hyperlinks that allow readers to avoid restricted area (e.g.
  metered models and paywalls) on news media publishers’ websites (see Nils Svensson and
  Others v Retriever Sverige AB- CJEU 13 feb. 2014). This diversion of traffic also negatively
  impacts on advertising revenues which are related to the number of clicks received on the
  newspaper website. Publishers’ content should therefore not be used without consent
  beyond what is absolutely necessary for navigational purposes in horizontal search.
  Specifically, where a hyperlink is comprised of or includes text protected as the whole or part
  of a copyright work (see The Newspaper Licensing Agency Ltd & Ors v Meltwater Holding BV
  & Ors [2011] EWCA Civ 890), the ‘provision’ of a hyperlink would involve the reproduction of
  the whole or part of a copyright work. In such circumstances, the authorisation of the
  rightholder would be appropriate. This is especially relevant to the provision of paid-for
  services to business users, which would otherwise substitute for services which currently
  generate important income streams for content owners.
  A link to copyright protected content on a copyright infringing site is and has to be subject to
  the authorisation of the rightholder. Another circumstance that requires authorisation is the
  commercial use of hyperlinks by third parties. News content is the “raw” material used by
  aggregators, press clippers and media monitoring services to offer their own services. These
  services could not exist if publishers didn’t finance press content. Nevertheless, from a
  newspaper publishers’ point of view, the EU copyright framework gives the above mentioned
  necessary protection.




  12.   Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
  reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the

                                                                                                5
screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under
specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
 
YES, under specific circumstances
When search engines, news aggregators and other third parties link to editorial content on
the Internet, there is an increased risk that readers may not be motivated to click further on to
access the newspaper website, if they already received relevant information in the extracts
provided alongside the link. From a journalistic point of view, the first lines of news article are
very important because they are written to catch the attention of the readers and provide the
essence of a story which is developed in further details below these first lines.


Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC clearly gives the response to this
question. Temporary acts of reproduction referred to in Article 2, which are transient or
incidental [and] an integral and essential part of a technological process and whose sole
purpose is to enable:
(a) a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary, or
(b) a lawful use
of a work or other subject-matter to be made, and which have no independent economic
significance, shall be exempted from the reproduction right provided for in Article 2.
Everything which goes beyond this exception (and is not covered by any other exception of
paragraph 2) is protected under copyright.
It is also apparent from the recitals to Directive 2001/29/EC (e.g., recitals 4, 9, 10, 11 and 12)
that rightholders are intended to be afforded a high level of protection in respect of their
copyrighted works. Furthermore, the Directive (e.g. recitals 15 and 22) makes it clear that
copyright plays an important role in the fight against piracy.
In addition, Article 5(5) of Directive 2001/29/EC makes it clear that the exception in Article
5(1) (which provides a limited exception for certain temporary copies) is not intended to
operate in a manner which conflicts with a normal exploitation of the work and/or
unreasonably prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder.


Non-commercial and commercial use
In most cases, a website owner will want people to visit their website to read/view the
material on it. Therefore in many if not most cases, the rights-holder will have granted an
express or implied licence to the user to make any screen/cache copies of a web page.
However, it does not follow from this that the rightholder should therefore simply be divested
of the fundamental choice either to prevent such copies being made, or to impose a licence
fee for making them. In a minority of cases, the rightholder may wish to restrict use of its
website content. Sometimes the rightholder will erect a paywall to restrict access to its
content to achieve this. A paywall ,however, applies the same restriction on access to all
users.
A newspaper publisher might, for example, wish to allow members of the public to freely view
its website for non-commercial use while precluding, or charging a licence fee for, any
commercial use. Copyright provides the legal basis for the publisher to preclude that use or

                                                                                                 6
  make that charge. If, however, there is no paywall but the publisher is unable to rely on
  copyright to charge a licence fee for such commercial use, the publisher is deprived of
  revenue that they would have otherwise been entitled to (and which they do receive in
  relation to the same commercial use in the offline world, where the user would have to pay
  for the printed copy). This would therefore conflict with the normal exploitation of the work
  and/or unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder.



4. Download to own digital content
  13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
  trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
    YES – Please explain by giving examples
  14.   [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
  consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously
  purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.


  From the point of view of newspaper publishers, a legal framework enabling the resale of
  previously purchased digital content would pose a severe threat to any existing and future
  business models of press publishers.
  If, for example, a weekly newspaper which has been purchased would be resold within the
  same week on a digital resale platform, readers would not buy the newspaper from the
  original publisher. To apply the same principle of exhaustion of the right to control the resale
  in Recital 28 to digital products would simply destroy paid for business models.
  Such a resale right would certainly undermine the primary market, e.g., by negatively
  impacting prices and reducing incentives to invest in newspaper content. The outcome would
  ultimately negatively impact media pluralism.
  Ultimately it should be up to a rightholder to decide on how their content can be used by
  others.



  C.     Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
  15.    Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification
  and licensing of works and other subject matter?
    NO
   The view of news media publishers is that a registration system at EU level would create an
  unnecessary administrative burden and result in an overall weakening of copyright
  protection, due to the inevitable assumption that only registered works would benefit from
  copyright protection.
  Under current international copyright legislation, registration cannot be made compulsory or
  constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
  Furthermore such a system would be against Article 5 paragraph 2 which clearly states that
  the enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be subject to any formality.


                                                                                                7
16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
X


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
Please refer to the answer under point 15.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?



D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
19.   What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
ownership and permissions databases?
Today, technology is being further developed to facilitate click-through licensing solutions in
the press sector. In particular, a cross-media, multinational coalition of more than 40 partners
– including press publishers - from the media and creative industries, including
representatives of authors and artists, was launched in 2011 to work together with their
standards bodies to establish automated and semi-automated communications, based on
identifiers and interoperable metadata standards, between rightholders and those who wish
to use content. ENPA is a partner organisation of the Linked Content Coalition (LCC).
A pilot project, the RDI, supported by the European Commission is now underway to further
develop the project. Any Web user creating new content, whether it involves re-use of
existing content or not, should be able simply to add such identifiers to enable them to better
protect and potentially monetise their content.
Publishers of newspapers and news media support a continued dialogue with the European
Commission in order to inform and update it as regards exploring possible pan-European
dimensions to national initiatives such as the UK’s Copyright Hub. Where feasible, the EC
can support the work of initiatives, which aim to develop further internet-based solutions for
the provision of legal access to and use of text and image based works.
Nevertheless, EU legislative intervention is not necessary from the point of view of press
publishers in order to promote or make such systems obligatory. We would advise it to be left
the market to continue developing the necessary tools.



E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?


20.   Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
  YES



                                                                                                 8
Publishers of newspapers and news media regard the current terms of copyright protection
as appropriate in the digital environment. Publishers should have the benefits of the
protection of their intellectual property rights, also in recognition of the historical and cultural
importance of news reporting of current and past events and the vital role that newspapers
play in a democratic society.
Maintaining an appropriate duration of copyright protection is particularly important for
newspaper publishers, given the commercial value of their archives which are increasingly
part of subscription and other paid-for business models.
Newspaper publishers digitise and make available their content not only through their print
and digital editions, but also through their archives and databases on a commercial basis.
While we have much in common with the other publishing sectors, newspaper publishers
differ in our business models, with our archives having a significant commercial value. New
markets are developing all the time, for both historic and contemporary collections.




     II.   Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


21.   Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
NO
The current optional nature allows Member States the possibility to exercise their national
competence regarding creative and media content which, by its nature, is predominantly of
local, regional and national character. There is nothing to indicate that more mandatory
exceptions and limitations would lead to a better result than the pragmatic approach chosen
by the EU, based on optional exceptions and limitations, combined with the development of
practical solutions on a case-by-case basis to enhance harmonisation, when required and
appropriate.
This pragmatic, voluntary approach has also allowed Europe to take the lead in the
development of innovative solutions and enabled that European “IPR-intensive industries
account for more than 56 million jobs, or 26% of total employment, in the EU.”
(http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/intellectual-property/docs/joint-report-epo-ohim-final-
version_en.pdf, page 59.)


22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a
need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
NO
The current EU legislative framework provides an appropriate balance between rightholders
and users in terms of rights and exceptions to copyright. Changing this equilibrium would
jeopardise the investment of publishers in editorial content, undermine their commercial
activities and hold back the development of new business models.
The European Union model has been shaped by the various legal, cultural and historical
traditions of its Member States, which vary substantially and encompass civil law and
common law countries. This diversity of traditions poses challenges to the European Union,

                                                                                                       9
but it also represents its strength. Publishers of newspapers and news media do not regard
harmonisation of exceptions and limitations to be either necessary or beneficial in the EU
context of 28 Member States with different cultural backgrounds.
In the view of publishers, the mix of elements in the EU copyright framework, is carefully
chosen to address national requirements and traditions. Flexibility can only be built on
general principles, leaving some degree of discretion to the Member States.
Exceptions and limitations in national legislation are subject to compliance with the three-step
test of the Berne Convention, reiterated in EUCD Article 5.5, and adapted to the special
needs and legal and other traditions of the individual Member State. In the EU, this general
principle is combined with a mandatory and several optional exceptions and limitations. We
do not see how more detailed norms on a Community level could serve the purpose
of improved access to copyright works or enhanced competitiveness in a changing
technological and media environment.




23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
NO
Any further limitation or exceptions would cause a serious risk to publishers existing business
models and to the development of new digital business models. This would ultimately lead to
a threat to publishers’ ability to continue fulfilling their democratic mission in society and also
place media diversity at risk. Furthermore, any reform of the EU copyright framework should
certainly not include the introduction into European copyright law of an American-style
general fair use provision.
Publishers of newspapers and news media are strongly opposed to the introduction of a “fair
use” provision into EU copyright framework. In our view, a “fair use” provision is wholly
unnecessary in the context of the EU copyright framework which already provides for a
comprehensive list of exceptions and limitations to copyright. “Fair use” in the United States
is based on a different legal system and its scope is still being defined after decades of case
law on the issue.
Furthermore, the widely differing interpretation of what “Fair Use” actually means inevitably
creates legal uncertainty. This uncertainty has led to four cases being considered by the US
Supreme Court over a decade.
The United States experience also shows that such a provision favours those who have the
resources to litigate. Fair use is frequently cited as a defence in copyright infringement cases
in the U.S.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
 NO
Newspaper publishers would like to stress that the optionality of exceptions and limitations in
the EUCD already provides for a sufficient degree of flexibility. EU legislation already allows
for a comprehensive list of exceptions to copyright.



                                                                                                10
  25.     If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
  interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives,
  interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or
  fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the
  relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible
  effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

  26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience,
  constitute a problem?
   NO
  In general, in respect of licensing of newspaper content, the territoriality of limitations and
  exceptions does not constitute particular problems. User requests related to rights are to a
  large extent confined to uses and users within the territory of one member state. Demands
  for cross-border or multi-territory licensing are limited and can be satisfactorily addressed on
  the basis of the current models of operation.
  As set out in previous questions, the flexibility provided by the Directive, which allows for the
  territoriality of limitations and exceptions, is important in order for the copyright framework to
  meet the needs of individual Member States, taking into account Europe’s cultural diversity.


  27.   In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
  have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be
  addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom,
  where?)
  X



  A.     Access to content in libraries and archives

1. Preservation and archiving
  28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
  problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or
  other subject matter in your collection?
  (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use
  by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation
  exception?
  NO
  Respect for copyright and fair competition are essential preconditions for publishers’
  continued investment in the wide range of quality content to inform European citizens.
  Archiving newspapers should only be done with an aim to preserve European cultural
  heritage. At national level in almost all EU Member States, newspaper publishers are
  involved in partnerships and agreements with libraries, which enable the libraries to fulfil their
  mission in the premises of the library, whilst at the same time respecting copyright legislation
  and not interfering with publishers’ commercial activities. Publishers have many examples of
  this good cooperation.


                                                                                                 11
        29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

  30.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
  elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
  which conditions?
  X

  31.      If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
  X



2. Off-premises access to library collections
  32.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
  problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rightholders that enable you to
  provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts
  thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
  (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
  problems when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-
  matter held in the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries
  when you are not on the premises of the institutions in question?
  (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
  institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including
  across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes
  of research and private study?
  X
  Yes, newspaper publishers have licence agreements with libraries and archives to give off-
  premises access to their archives and content to students for research and education
  purposes. These agreements are made in respect of the copyright protection of the content
  provided by newspapers. It is of outmost importance that the existing exception in article 5
  (3) (n) remains for use within the premises of the libraries and archives and that any off
  premises use needs an agreement with the right holders. Those agreements, which also
  include special technical measures in order to access content, ensure that business models
  of newspaper publishers are not harmed by giving free access to their content to students
  and other researchers.
  We also understand that RROs in different Member States negotiate agreements with
  libraries, enabling them to provide remote access to - as well as document delivery of - text
  and image works, including across borders. It is important that right holders should continue
  to be able to authorise of off-premises online consultation of works and make appropriate
  agreements with libraries/universities (rather than this being set out in law).

  Newspaper publishers are not aware of any problems. However, it is important that this sort
  of remote access is agreed in a licensing agreements – and not in legislation - and does not
  prejudice right holders’ exploitation of their own content.

  34.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
  elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
  which conditions?

  Publishers do not think that a legislative solution is needed.

  35.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?



3. E – lending
  36.    (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
  when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending),
  including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
  (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
  problems when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending),
  including across borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
  (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
  to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across
  borders?

  YES

  There are license agreements that enable for lending digital newspapers from public libraries.
  E-books, audio-books but also numerous digital editions of newspapers are also offered on
  the lending platform www.onleihe.net.

  The German-language www.onleihe.net has a network of 1400 libraries offering approx. 120
  000 titles of media from 800 different publishers.

  Every year around 15,000 new titles of media are added. In 2012 a total of 4 million loans
  were made against 2013, when the number was up to 7 million.


  37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

  We are not aware of any specific problems at present as regards newspapers. However, it is
  particularly important that terms of any e-lending activities are agreed contractually in
  advance between libraries etc. and rightholders.

  The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).




                                                                                               13
  38.   [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
  management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
  subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
  X

  39.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
  libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
  activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending?
  What problems have you encountered?
  Any off-premises consultation of newspapers content via a library poses a severe risk to the
  business models of newspapers. People would then not subscribe, buy or consult websites
  or apps of newspapers any longer. It is therefore essential that such uses continue to be
  agreed individually between publishers and libraries.




4. Mass digitisation
  40.       [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
  digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
  necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011
  MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have
  a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
  NO
  The mass-digitisation of newspaper content by public libraries or by private companies may
  represent a risk to publishers’ ability to develop new business models in the digital
  environment, and to monetise their content.
  The main focus in the 2011 MOU was on books since the newspaper sector functions in an
  entirely different way and newspapers digitise and make available “old” content through their
  online archives and databases on a commercial basis. It is rather difficult to define out of
  commerce works for press.


  41.    Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed
  for other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’
  archives)?
  NO
  Mass-digitisation of newspaper content by public libraries or by private companies represents
  a considerable risk to publishers’ ability to make contractual agreements with their partners,
  in order to monetise their content and therefore ensure that their titles can remain sustainable
  in both the print and digital environment.
  Providing new mechanisms for mass-digitisation would represent a direct threat to
  publishers’ economic sustainability and their ability to respond adequately to the digital
  challenges.



                                                                                               14
B.     Teaching
42.      (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration
for teaching, including across borders?
NO
We are not aware of any specific problem. However, newspaper publishers understand the
exception in Article 5(3)(a) as being a narrow exception to the exclusive rights, aimed at
enabling exactly what it states: to illustrate; which is far from being the same as planned
producing of teaching material. Teaching material in whatever format, including multiple
copying for classroom use, cannot and is not destined to be made under this exception, as it
would definitely undermine the normal exploitation of these works. Therefore any broadening
of the existing exception would seriously undermine business models of publishers and
existing licensing solutions.


43.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Regarding illustration and teaching, licensing agreements are the most pragmatic way
forward in addressing problems, rather than e.g., legislation.
Furthermore, newspaper publishers feel that the licensing agreements have a firm societal
advantage regarding the value of content. Licensing demonstrates to consumers that
creative works and content have a value and that using works that are created and owned by
others thus require their authorisation or license. In addition, newspaper publishers remain
very active in media literacy programmes at educational establishments covering all age
groups.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

Publishers of newspapers and news media have been pioneers in promoting the use of
content for teaching purposes. The role of news media publishers in improving media literacy
through various programmes, particularly in schools, was recognized in the 2009 European
Commission Recommendation on media literacy (2009/625/CE).

Furthermore, publishers’ individual licensing schemes are used extensively by e.g., the
scientific and research communities (also together with collective licensing schemes offered
by RROs), for print as well as online use. One outcome of the Licences for Europe (Working
Group 2) was the development of a “toolkit” setting out examples of tools currently available
by RROs and other CMOs to legally use copyright protected text and image works, including
for education. This toolkit, presented by IFRRO, was supported by ENPA and its members.

The newspaper sector across the different markets in Europe has been active for many years
at national level in specially developed “Newspaper in Education” programmes in primary



                                                                                            15
and secondary schools. A diverse selection of these initiatives from 18 countries across
Europe are showcased in the ENPA publication on media literacy, “What’s your News?”.
Link to What’s Your News? publication:
http://www.enpa.be/en/publications/whats-your-news-_62.aspx

Due to the efforts of publishers, news media content in both print and digital formats plays an
essential role in teaching programmes that focus on the ability of citizens to inform
themselves and to analyse current social, political and economic developments.

It is also worth mentioning that members of the above-mentioned PDLN have created made-
to-measure offers to educational institutions, for example the Danish Infomedia.

In the digital era, these projects have shown to be really helpful to media users to develop
understanding of how and why media content is produced and to evaluate the
trustworthiness of different sources. These programmes both help young people approach
media content, distinguish between fact and opinion, and between editorial and advertising,
as well as teaching them how to create their own press content.


45.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
what conditions?



46.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
Some national news media sectors, depending on their national culture and tradition, would
welcome further government support for media literacy projects involving newspapers in
schools.


C.     Research


47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context
of research projects/activities, including across borders?
  NO
We are not aware of any issues. Nevertheless it has to be underlined that any broadening of
the existing exception would create a serious risk to existing business models and licensing
solutions. However, while there are generally no major problems, for some publishers lack of
consistency in provisions on fair compensation for non-commercial research across the EU
has been an issue.


48.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


                                                                                            16

49.   What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?


Publishers provide licensing solutions for access to newspaper content for researchers and
academic institutions for the purposes of scientific research, often free of charge or for a
minimal fee. Publishers continue efforts to make such licensing easier and more efficient.



D.     Disabilities
50.     (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this
exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?


NO
Exceptions and limitations in favour of persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise
print disabled, exist in all EU Member States. Also, publishers offer licensing agreements to
facilitate access to copyright published works for those user groups.
In the EU Member States, exceptions for persons with disabilities, especially for Visually
Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities, are included in national copyright laws
according to the legal traditions of each country. ENPA members believe that the exceptions
and limitations in the current EU copyright framework are well applied and respected in the
various Member States. In addition, publishers have concluded successful licensing
agreements with different categories of users (schools, libraries, health organisations, etc.),
which address their specific needs and expectations in the digital and print environment.
Publishers are aware of many barriers to access to information experienced by persons who
have partial vision and who have print disabilities. Publishers support the goal that visually
impaired persons/persons with print disabilities have access to information.
The main challenge is linked to the cross-border exchange of accessible format copies. The
WIPO Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually
Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled, will undoubtedly contribute to the enhancement of the
cross-border exchange of such copies. It will, however, take time for the Treaty to come into
force and be implemented in national legislation.



                                                                                             17
ENPA believes that any initiative in this field should be focused directly on improving
accessibility, fully taking into account the national character of copyright law in the Member
States and ensuring that the accessible format copy is used exclusively by beneficiary
persons. Such an instrument must remain fair in its application to commercially available
newspaper content, with the prior authorisation of the rightholder.
Newspaper publishers are involved and/or are open to discussions and voluntary
agreements with Authorised Entities and other stakeholders at national level in order to find
balanced voluntary partnerships and agreements, which enable the Authorised Entities
to fulfill their mission, while at the same time respecting copyright legislation and not
undermining publishers’ commercial activities with respect to their content.
It is of fundamental importance that any agreement reached regarding the digitisation
and/or making available of a work for the print disabled should be on a voluntary
basis. ENPA believes that remuneration should be part of any agreement, unless the
publisher chooses to proceed in another way.
Publishers believe that the appropriate solution to provide newspaper content for the print
disabled is not more legislation, but cooperation and licensing on a voluntary basis for
between publishers and Authorised Entities, as is already the case in a number of Member
States.


51.    If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
-

52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to
content? How successful are they?

It is clear that considerable resources are required to make works accessible to visually
impaired persons and persons with print disabilities. ENPA believes that public institutions
and government have an important role to play in providing sufficient technical and financial
means to Authorised Entities representing persons with print disabilities, as this is part of the
public sector and the public mission of the state.
Newspaper publishers have many good examples of national, local voluntary cooperation
and projects. For example, in Denmark, publishers together with the Journalists Union have
signed a framework agreement with ”Local Government Denmark”, the interest group and
member authority of Danish municipalities making it possible for Danish municipalities to
make sound recordings of newspaper articles for the benefit of visually impaired persons. In
this case, a fee of approximately 10 euro per subscriber is paid to the rightholders per year.
Both national, regional and local newspaper articles are being recorded as well as articles
from freely distributed weeklies.

E.       Text and data mining
53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining
methods, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including
across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected
content, including across borders?
 
NO
Publishers of newspapers and news media have not experienced specific problems from the
use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content, when TDM access is
provided for scientific research purposes via licensing models developed by publishers or the
licensing organisations with whom they work.

There is, however, serious potential for problems resulting from the use of text and data
mining in relation to copyright protected content, in cases there would be an exception for
TDM access to newspaper archives.

Publishers of newspapers and news media provide access to copyright protected content for
text and data mining for scientific research purposes via licensing models developed by
publishers, or the licensing organisations with whom they work.

ENPA was actively involved in the European Commission’s ‘Licences for Europe’ stakeholder
dialogue, including Working Group 4 on text and data mining. Several participants in the
working group presented a range of practical and innovative solutions that already exist, such
as standard licensing models as well as technology platforms, in order to promote efficient
use of TDM for scientific research purposes. Some of these initiatives are already
successfully being used by publishers and researchers, while others which are being
launched now or being piloted with a view to being launched in the near future.

At European level, exceptions and limitations to copyright should only be introduced when
there is market failure. With contractual relationships and licensing solutions already in place
and more initiatives due to be launched, there is clearly no market failure in relation to TDM.
Moreover, from the publishers’ point of view, an exception for TDM access that would apply
to copyrighted content in newspaper archives could result in serious problems.

In ENPA’s view, TDM has to be a managed process facilitated by licensing for the following
reasons:

     •   It is vital for the long-term sustainability of the publishing sector that publishers retain
         the right to decide whether their content may or may not be re-used by others,
         especially where such re-use may impact on publishers’ business. In particular, the

                                                                                                  19
       end results of any research should not become a substitute for the published content.
       This would inevitably jeopardise continued investment by publishers in a wide range
       of authoritative content, to the benefit of democratic society. An exception for TDM
       has the potential to infringe the 3-Step test in the Berne Convention, where such re-
       use of copyrighted content could conflict with normal exploitation of publishers’
       archives.

   •   Publishers are already licensing TDM access to their archives, for example for
       linguists for the purposes language research. However, it is important for publishers
       that this is done on a case by case basis, since even if such research is not done for
       commercial use it can have implications on newspaper business models if, for
       example, certain material would be made public even though the newspaper could
       have exploited this information. Also, in some cases research may be directly linked
       to commercial activities, or the result of academic research may be applied over time
       to commercial ends.

   •   TDM access has to be a managed process in order to avoid disruption of the various
       platforms used by publishers. In this context, it is important that potential miners
       continue to engage with publishers to use systems compatible with publishers’
       platforms in order to achieve the best outcome for their research. This is of mutual
       benefit to avoid disruption to the platforms and/or degradation to the content, which
       may happen when unmanaged mining takes place without publisher support.


   •   It is clearly to the mutual benefit of both publishers of content and miners to find
       licensing solutions which permit researchers to mine works and allow them to do so
       as seamlessly and easily as possible, while securing publishers’ investments in their
       publications. Publishing houses have to be able to carefully manage the TDM
       process, in order to prevent massive abuse or loss of their archives. Unmanaged
       access would place entire newspaper databases of copyrighted content at risk.

   •   Any potential exception for TDM could be misused by news aggregators and media
       monitoring companies in order to avoid the necessity of licensing their activities.
       Therefore any exception could seriously undermine legitimate revenues streams for
       publishers’ businesses.

Specific licensing solutions presented during “Licences for Europe” include a sample licence
clause, presented by STM, which allows publishers to easily provide a quick answer to
requests made by the scientific community to be able to text and data mine content for which
they have a subscription. Other initiatives include PLS Clear, a digital clearing house
initiative from the UK’s Publishers Licensing Society (PLS), which connects researchers and
publishers to further simplify TDM. Crossref’s Prospect initiative shows that thanks to
technical innovations TDM for research for non-commercial purposes is possible via a click-
through licence, and with simultaneous access to cross-publisher content in one
standardized format, as is the case with Copyright Clearance Centre’s (CCC) pilot TDM
service concerning both subscribed and non-subscribed content for commercial researchers,
set for commercial release in 2014. “PDR” licences have also been successfully developed
for the pharmaceutical industry for commercial uses.




                                                                                          20
Publishers of newspapers and news media continue to be open to discussing and finding
ever more efficient licensing solutions together with the research community, in order to

been developed to date and ENPA welcomes continued work in this field. This non-legislative

It is clearly to the mutual benefit of both publishers of content and miners to find licensing
solutions which permit researchers to mine works and allow them to do so as seamlessly and
easily as possible, while securing the publishers’ investments in their publications.

European Commission’s ‘Licences for Europe’ Working Group 4 on text and data mining
explored solutions such as standard licensing models as well as technology platforms to
facilitate TDM access, with the aim of promoting the efficient use of TDM for scientific
research purposes. Several participants presented a range of practical and innovative
solutions, which represent the result of major investment by the publishing industry and the
licensing organisations with whom they work. Some of these initiatives are already
successfully being used by publishers and researchers, while others which are being
launched now or being piloted with a view to being launched in the coming months.

These initiatives include a sample licence clause, presented by STM, which allows

benefiting from the solutions that have been developed to date. ENPA welcomes these
innovative solutions and the continued work in this field and believe that this non-legislative
approach represents the most constructive way forward for both the researchers and
publishers concerned.

57.    Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the
use of text or data mining methods?



F.     User-generated content
58.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced
problems when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate
new content on the Internet, including across borders?

(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when
users publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other
subject-matter through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate
new content on the Internet, including across borders?
 NO
User-generated content should never aim to make available protected content but to serve
users’ personal creative effort. Current exceptions, such as quotation, already allow users to
generate their own new content inspired by existing protected works without harming the
normal exploitation of the protected works.
In response to and in some cases in anticipation of their readers’ needs, press publishers are
heavily investing time and resources in digital innovation so that consumers are today able to
read and interact with their trusted, professional content at any time of the day in a range of
different formats and via various devices. As a result the press is now available on all
platforms and is more interactive than ever before.
Press publishers recognise and welcome that press publishing is a two-way dialogue in
today’s digital environment. UGC in the press-publishing sector concerns on the one hand
what users do with publishers’ content and on the other how publishers then choose to
interact with that content. In summary:
Publishers choose to share professional content with their readers, in order that they may
share it with others, for example by allowing links to articles to be shared via social media.
Readers choose to share content with publishers, in order that they can contribute to
democratic debate, for example, by providing text, photographs and video via publishers’
websites or applications on various devices in relation to news events.
In the digital environment, press publishers want users to engage with professionally
produced content in ways that were not previously possible, recognising the richness and
depth of debate that can arise from this approach. An increasing number of press publishers
actively encourage this dynamic interaction with the users, to the benefit of both parties.
UGC has proven to be truly helpful in providing spontaneous material and feedback from the
public’s perspective in addition to professionally produced journalistic content, which is

                                                                                            22
trusted by its readers. This is particularly the case for live events and certainly in those rare
and more extreme situations where access of journalists has been restricted.
With greater and more integrated use of UGC in mind, many publishers have redesigned
their digital layouts in order to meet the expectations of the public and increase traffic, for
instance by giving prominence to live blogging or other ways of the public engaging with their
newspaper or magazine. Citizen participation supported by press publishers creates a
valuable societal dynamic and the collaboration between UGC and quality professional
journalism represents a new, and fascinating chapter for publishing and journalism.
59.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the
basis of pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use?
NO
Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?
YES, proprietary systems are sufficient. Where users want to submit content to publishers for
publication, publishers provide for terms and conditions, which set out the uses the
publishers may undertake with the shared content, should they choose to provide their
content. Publishers are increasingly promoting awareness of such terms and conditions.
It is clear from the above that engaging with UGC in some capacity is now part of the daily
business of publishing for many publishing houses, with this two-way dialogue being
beneficial for both publishers and users. By facilitating easier access to their content for
users, this allows publishers to enjoy much closer contact with their readership.
Specifically, press publishers are keen to facilitate and promote users’ access to content,
participation and interaction by adopting tools to provide comments, upload photos, and
share links in social media and elsewhere. This approach is very much at the heart of the
press in today’s digital environment. For example, press publishers are increasingly choosing
to provide “share” & “recommend” buttons and encourage users to share professional press
content with others, with a variety of new platforms offering easy ways of doing so. They
clear, as required, rights relating to the various contributors to their content in order to enable
such use by users.
This approach to sharing selected content means that publishers can better understand how
far articles are being shared and which are the most popular etc., but importantly does not
pose a risk to their sustainability as unlimited copying and pasting of all their content for
sharing would do.
60.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you
experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for
users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-
existing works) through your service?
NO


61.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
As set out above, newspaper publishers use licensing solutions. We do not perceive UGC as
a problem as such and the need for any legislative action in this field to e.g., introduce an

                                                                                                23
exception, has not been proven. Please refer to the details set out in the Licences for Europe
pledge no 6 “More active reader involvement in the online press”, which was introduced to
the     Plenary      by      press     publishers:     http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-
dialogue/sites/licences-for-europe-dialogue/files/6-Users-online-press.pdf.
It should be noted in light of discussions about what UGC means, that it is important to
distinguish between new original work created by a “non-professional” and existing works
which such a person either “copies”, or reuses, or “adapts” for the purposes of publishing a
new composite work. It is important that the public is properly educated about these
distinctions.


62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
Newspaper publishers do not see the need for a legislative initiative regarding UGC.

63.          If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
Press publishers who are contacted by users wishing to use their content typically provide
licences for use of the content. These licenses are often for free as long as it is not for
commercial exploitation.
Furthermore, please consult the publishers’ Declaration on improving the user
experience           (http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/sites/licences-for-
europe-dialogue/files/6-Users-online-press.pdf), which sets out that press publishers are
committed to – and continue to be committed to - engaging with readers and improving the
user experience, including via the uptake of User Generated Content (UGC) in their online
publications and services, giving a voice to users as well as enhancing their professional
content offering. This is very much in the interests of both publishers and users alike.
While we don’t perceive there to be “problems” per se in the area of UGC for the newspaper
sector, our pledge to Licenses for Europe stakeholder dialogue was even more user
engagement in the online press and news reporting. In this regard, we declared the
importance of the following (see further details in the pledge):
1. Improving the user experience and involvement
2. Improving information about both what users can do with press publishers’ content and
what press publishers can do with users’ content
3. Promoting education about intellectual property rights (IPR)
4. Promoting awareness of the technological possibilities to better identify and protect
content
5. Sharing best practices across the sector



      III.     Private copying and reprography

64.    In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application
of the private copying and reprography exceptions2 in the digital environment?

2
    Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                                                                                            24
  NO
In the print environment, in most EU Member States, publishers generally rely on
Reprographic Rights’ Organisations (RROs) to manage their reprographic rights. In the digital
environment, however, in various Member States, publishing companies have developed
different services that offer, license and give access to copyrighted works such as articles,
photographs, etc. through publishers’ websites and databases or archive services. It is
important to underline that for both print and digital works, publishers should be free to
choose between collective and individual rights management. However, whenever direct
licensing is not an option – for example when it becomes burdensome for both users and
rightholders – levies have a specific task when publishers are unable to authenticate
reproduction of works. Levies play an effective role when licensing is burdensome or
impossible, notably in cases of reprography and private copying.

65.    Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the
rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?3
This answer cannot be responded to by a simple yes or no. The European Court of Justice
(CJEU) decided in the VG WORT case (C-457/11-C460/11) that a possible consent by the
copyright holder to the copying of his work or other protected material in the context of the
exceptions or limitations provided for in EUCD Article 5.2 and 5.3 has no effect on fair
remuneration payable under the exception. This means that remuneration paid to the author
or publisher under a licence does not preclude from receiving the fair compensation for the
exception or limitation. Such copies may therefore be covered by the levies, if provided for in
national legislation.

66.     How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services
(e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies
on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models
on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?


Where publishers are remunerated for certain uses on the basis of copyright levies, the
device and storage medium remuneration is also payable if protected works are copied in
connection with online services (e.g. cloud computing). However we are of the view that the
levies system and its organisation should be decided at national level.


67.   Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for
products subject to levies?4

NO

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying

  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                            25
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments5. Furthermore it would create an unnecessary
burden.

68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to
the free movement of goods or services?
 NO
69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
    persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those
    transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you
    provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.)

In respect of text and image (reprography) levies, the question is irrelevant, as underlined by
the Commission’s mediator on levies, Antonio Vitorino6, this question is not relevant as
regards text and image reprography levies, as the Information Society Directive (Article
5.2(a)) covers both private and professional uses, thereby justifying sales to both private
individuals and to business end users.

Consequently, when it comes to analysing the impact of reprography levies, it is not relevant
to make a distinction between private and professional uses, since both of them are subject to
the payment of a levy. Against this background, it is also unnecessary to distinguish between
sales of devices in the private and business sectors. The point is that copies are permitted by
law in both the private and business spheres. The – unified – device and storage medium
remuneration can therefore be justified both for sales to private persons and sales to business
end users.


70.     Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To
what extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing
in some Member States help to remedy the situation?
We refer to our response to question 69, which, in short, states that, under EUCD Article
5.2(a), text and image (reprography) levies also covers professional uses. Question 70
therefore becomes irrelevant in relation to text and image (reprography) levies.

71.   If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
NO

    IV.   Fair remuneration of authors and performers

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for
the exploitation of your works and performances?
X

73.   Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
 NO
Publishers of newspaper and news media believe that it is important to emphasise that
respect for the freedom to contract and to negotiate should be the fundamental basis to any
approach to this area. For ENPA, a cross-sectoral and pan-European approach to
employment practice in the press sector would represent a real threat to the freedom to
contract.

Any proposal for a common framework would not be an appropriate way to address contract
law, which has been built on the basis of sector specificities and which has evolved in this
context in the various Member States. Any EU initiatives in this field should therefore avoid a
“one size fits all” solution that would fail to take into account the distinction between
publishing, audio-visual content and music, since the contractual relationships and rights’
mangement are organised differently in each sector. Moreover, different concepts and legal
situations exist in the EU Member States when it comes to copyright and employment
practices, ownership and transfer of rights, as well as presumption of rights. Various
concepts and approaches are used because each corresponds to a different underlying legal
system.

In some EU countries, publishers enter into collective negotiations at national or company
level with the union of professional journalists to achieve collective agreements regarding
press content and the remuneration of journalistic work. In this context, collective negotiation
for the acquisition of rights by publishers from their employees is closely linked to labour law
and employment contract law. It is, therefore, crucial that social dialogue in the newspaper
sector remains at national level and is not introduced at EU level.

According to Art. 4 Paragraph 2 b) of the TFEU the European Union has shared competence
in the field of social policy, but only for the aspects defined in this Treaty. In this way, and in
accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the role of the EU in this area is limited to
supporting and complementing the activities of Member States.

To sum up, publishers of newspapers and news media do not see any competence for any
EU action in the field of copyright contract law. Any approach at EU level would contravene
the principle of subsidiarity and would not respect national legislation already in place in the
different sub-categories of contract law and in the different sectors and would not respect the
freedom to contract.

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest
to address the shortcomings you identify?
X

                                                                                                27
   V.     Respect for rights
75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
  YES
A well-functioning IP protection and enforcement system is vital if Europe is to achieve the
full potential of a single digital market that delivers jobs, growth and delivers quality content
for consumers.
Infringements of intellectual property rights cause real economic harm to the newspaper
publishing sector and hold back its potential for re-investment and growth. In view of the
current Consultation, and considering the opportunities but also challenges that the Internet
continues to present, it is very important for newspaper publishers to be able to rely on
quantitative research on the sector. In our view, this should include an examination of the
economic impact on publishers’ investments as well as the financial impact and long-term
consequences for society of unauthorised use of content by third parties, including
aggregators, search engines and private companies, often for commercial gain.
Efficient enforcement mechanisms and procedures are essential to a well-functioning
intellectual property (IP) system. Well-functioning IPR enforcement mechanisms are the best
means to fight against counterfeiting and piracy, make sure that right holders and the society
as a whole can fully enjoy the benefits of the IP system and protect consumersʼ rights in their
purchasing decisions. Another crucial element is for different procedures to be launched at a
more reasonable cost in the future.


76.     In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to
foster the cooperation of intermediaries?


The content of newspaper websites mainly includes editorial content which falls under the
control and the responsibility of the publisher and the editor-in-chief. This content follows
national press law as well as ethical codes of conduct and self-regulation. However, with the
development of the digital economy and the evolution of Internet, newspaper websites
include interactive content and user-generated content, where readers and individual visitors
can express their views, add their own content or share information. It is practically and
economically not feasible or reasonable for publishers to systematically control or prevent
outside input posted by users.
In our view, it is therefore important and necessary to maintain the benefit of Article 14 for
publishers in certain cases (e.g. blogs, opinion forums etc.). Once an operator of an opinion
forum is aware of specific unlawful user submissions, he has to remove it immediately.
However, it has to be assured that the current provision is not interpreted in a way that the
operator has to check the forums constantly for any unlawful articles or even pre-censor
every post.
Infringements of intellectual property rights in both the print and digital environment must be
addressed and for that matter, a closer cooperation between all authorities and actors

                                                                                              28
involved, including intermediaries, is necessary. The implementation of the Enforcement
Directive should ensure coherence with the relevant provisions of the E-Commerce directive
including liability exemptions.
Press publishers have been concerned with the important question of how two essential legal
pillars for technology-neutral press can be safeguarded on the public Internet. The digital
press requires both effective copyright protection, which includes the possibility of practical
enforcement of rights against illegal reproductions of press products or parts thereof, as well
as effective freedom of the press.
In order to maintain good conditions for freedom of the press on the Internet, a number of
distinctions are necessary for the question of third party responsibility for content, some of
which are implemented in the E-Commerce-Directive and in any event not impeded by it or
by the Enforcement Directive. Newspaper publishers agree that it is fundamental to maintain
a distinction between data transport infrastructure, which is independent of content ("mere
conduit", Articles 12, 15 E-Commerce-Directive) and all forms of more or less content-related
data processing such as "hosting"(Article 14 et seq. E-Commerce-Directive).
Newspaper publishers are of the opinion that the judicial authority should be the one, who
can balance different rights and freedoms concerned, including freedom of expression.
Control of press content by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) would be considered as
censorship and therefore would pose a threat to digital press freedom.


77.    Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as
the protection of private life and protection of personal data?
 
YES
It is important to underline the right balance between the fundamental right of freedom of
expression and effective copyright protection online, which includes the possibility of practical
enforcement of rights against illegal reproductions of press content.
A necessary precondition to enforce copyright is an effectively enforceable right of
information to identify the name and address of the infringer, including in case of dynamic IP
addresses. In cases of copyright infringements of newspapers content, it is necessary to
ensure that judicial decisions can be adequately enforced and respected.
The Enforcement Directive has provided a broadly harmonised civil framework in Europe
regarding IPR infringements. It has been an important and necessary tool for publishers.
However, uniform implementation of the Directive should be ensured, as divergencies among
Member States still exist. ENPA and its members have not identified any specific problems
with regard to the Enforcement Directive, but with certain aspects of implementation of the
current text of the Directive.
- The right balance between the content control of Internet access providers and the digital
freedom of press should be assured.
- Enforcement measures on the basis of the Directive are often in practice complicated,
costly and time-consuming.




                                                                                              29
Not enough consideration has been given by the EU legislator to the interaction between
data protection rules and implementation of the Enforcement Directive, which leads to
inconsistencies and, in some cases, total lack of remedies for IP rights at national level. This
should be rectified in order to ensure that rightholders are not deprived of effective remedies
whenever their rights are infringed.
- Measures, procedures and remedies shall not be unnecessary complicated or costly, or
entail unreasonable time limits or unwarranted delays.
(Article 3§1 re. General obligation of the Directive) However, some cases at national level
(e.g. Copiepresse v. Google) reveals that procedures might be delayed for years due to
courts having an overload of cases to address, which therefore has an effect on the
enforcement of the rights infringed and could be to the advantage the infringer.
- The situation regarding damages awarded by the courts could be improved.
Damages awards often are not effectively deterring potential infringers from engaging in
illegal activities, particularly because the damages awarded by courts fail to match the level
of potential profit made by such infringements.



      VI. A single EU Copyright Title
78.   Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as
a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright
across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
NO
In respect of the copyright legal framework, the EU should continue to pursue a pragmatic
approach. Rather than putting time and resources into trying to developing the idea of a
single EU Copyright Title, the focus should be on the adoption of an overall IPR strategy,
especially given that the IPR intensive industries contribute over one third of EU’s GDP and
90% of EU’s export comes from IP intensive industries.
Work on a single EU Copyright Title would require substantial resources and unnecessarily
distract focus from the important work on an overall EU IP strategy. Also, it is difficult to see
how it could be established on the basis of Article 118 of the Lisbon Treaty (TFEU). The
different traditions and systems, which include both common and civil law practices benefit
from being maintained. Even if sufficient unanimity should be reached amongst EU Member
States as to the nature of EU copyright legislation, it is difficult to see that an overarching EU
Copyright Title is required.


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does
the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a
longer term project?
NO
Publishers of newspapers and news media believe that the WIPO Treaty and BERNE
Convention, together with the relevant European Directives CJEU case law, already
provides an important degree of harmonisation in the copyright field.



                                                                                               30
  VII.    Other issues

80.   Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
The newspaper and news media sector was one of the first creative sectors to offer its
content in digital formats and today is a sector in rapid transformation that offers a diverse
range of authoritative content to European citizens on a range of both print and digital
platforms. Despite the many challenges facing the industry, some 100 million newspapers
are sold or distributed in Europe every day. With the combined reach of print and digital
formats, the overall audience for our content has never been higher. Moreover, the sector
continues to play a vital role in democratic society and in stimulating debate on the great
issues facing European citizens today.
One of the challenges facing newspaper publishers in the digital environment is how to
ensure that technology companies and other third parties do not extract the value of their
content, without remuneration for those who created or invested in that content. Effective IPR
enforcement mechanisms and procedures are essential to combat both piracy and
parasitism, as well as to ensure that rightholders and society at large can fully enjoy the
benefits of the IP system. As the press is specifically mentioned in the European
Commission’s IPR Strategy under paragraph 3 about Europe's cultural heritage and fostering
media plurality.
Publishers of newspapers and news media believe that fair competition, respect of copyright
and value of content as well as equal search are indispensable conditions for the proper
functioning of the digital ecosystem, to the benefit of all users and consumers. Today,
technology platforms and search engines have an enormous impact on which press content
is visible and accessible to citizens on the Internet.
Publishers of newspapers and news media believe that fair competition and equal search are
indispensable conditions for the proper functioning of the digital ecosystem, to the benefit of
all users and consumers. Today, technology platforms and search engines have an
enormous impact on which press content is visible and accessible to citizens on the Internet.
In this context, it is essential that search engines act in a neutral way to ensure that all press
content can be found without any discrimination.
From the press perspective, we would also like to underline that net neutrality guarantees the
same quality of service and the same possibility to reach digital users for all content,
applications and service providers, regardless of a company’s financial capacity. Proposals
currently under discussion at EU level, which would allow for content discrimination, would be
seriously detrimental to innovation, press diversity and ultimately democracy.
