      A. Introduction


ECIS is an international non-profit association founded in 1989, which endeavours to promote a
favourable environment for interoperable ICT solutions.            It has actively represented its
members regarding issues related to interoperability and competition before European,
international and national fora, including the EU institutions and WIPO. ECIS’ members include
large and smaller information and communications technology ("ICT") hardware and software
providers. More information on ECIS is available at www.ecis.eu.

ECIS welcomes the discussion encouraged by the Commission's consultation on the review of
EU copyright rules, and supports the Commission's goal to understand better the conditions
that are currently hindering innovation and the provision of services that benefit consumers.

ECIS has been a champion of interoperability for more than 25 years, helping for example to
push through the interoperability provision of Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 (today
restated as Directive 2009/24/EC of 23 April 23 April 2009) (the "Software Copyright Directive"),
and to ensure that interoperability has been firmly on the agenda in the discussions over
various legislative debates on intellectual property and ICT-related matters.

Consistent with its long-standing position supporting interoperability as an enabler of vigorous
competition on the merits, and of diverse consumer choice, ECIS respectfully submits the need
to preserve the carefully crafted and balanced interoperability-related provisions of the
Software Copyright Directive. In parallel, and in view of recent technological developments,
ECIS cautions the Commission that text and data mining activities should remain outside the
scope of copyright protection. Finally, we fundamentally oppose the idea of expanding the
copyright levy system to cover cloud computing services.

      B. The importance of promoting innovation and growth in the ICT sector by
           safeguarding interoperability

                                                                                        1
The Commission noted in its 2010 Europe’s Digital Competitiveness Report                    that while
representing five per cent of GDP, the ICT industry drives 20 per cent of overall productivity
growth. Additionally, the ICT manufacturing sector, which accounts for one per cent of GDP, is
responsible for one quarter of total R&D investment. However, the European Commission's
                           2
2012 PREDICT Report prepared by its R&D unit also showed "a clear leadership of the US

versus the EU," pointing out that the US clearly leads on all figures when comparing
performances.

Data-driven innovation and increased interoperability are widely perceived as the fundaments
for the growth of the European information society and, more generally, the European
economy. To that effect, ECIS submits it is imperative to maintain the balance struck in the
current EU copyright framework between the interests of the various stakeholders at issue in
relation to the protection of computer programs. ECIS therefore stresses the importance of
safeguarding what has been already achieved (including in particular the exceptions associated
with reverse engineering).

Against this background, the exceptions for reverse engineering embedded in Articles 5 and 6
of the Software Copyright Directive should not be compromised in any reform of the EU
copyright rules.    The importance of safeguarding the carefully struck balance between the
various stakeholders' interests was underscored in the legislative debate preceding the
adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC of 22 May 2001 (the "Information Society Directive"). The EU
                                                                                                          th
legislature made sure that the balance would not be compromised by introducing the 50
Recital of the Information Society Directive, which acknowledged that "Articles 5 and 6 of [the
Software Copyright Directive] exclusively determine exceptions to the exclusive rights
applicable to computer programs." Both the Commission and the General Court of the EU in
                      3
the Microsoft case        have acknowledged the necessity of balancing intellectual property
considerations and interoperability considerations in the software industry, including with
respect to non-dominant players.

In relation to the review of EU copyright rules, ECIS acknowledges that there is another area
which requires the Commission's attention and focus in order to prevent copyright from
hindering further technological developments and growth of the ICT industry. This area is text
                                                                                                              4
and data mining services. In the UK, in the 2011 Review of Intellectual Property and Growth
("2011 Report"), Professor Ian Hargreaves acknowledged that "the law can block valuable new
technologies, like text and data mining, simply because those technologies were not imagined
when the law was formed." ECIS cautions the Commission that text and data mining should
remain outside the scope of copyright protection.

As a final point, ECIS strongly opposes the expansion of the copyright levy system to cover

and has been a source of legal uncertainty and lack of harmonisation. Therefore, we strongly
believe that replicating this system in the cloud services sector would harm growth of the sector
in the EU, and would result in EU cloud computing services lagging behind their US
counterparts.

    C. Reply to the questionnaire


ECIS has provided answers only to questions 11, 21 to 24, 26, 53, 55 to 57, and 66.

11.     Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject
to the authorisation of the rightholder?

 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

X NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of
communication to the public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a
copyright exception)


Hyperlinks, links from one resource to another, are a fundamental building block of the web and
the Internet. A hyperlink is basically a reference to another resource expressed by the Uniform
Resource Locator ("URL") of that resource. When a user selects a hyperlink available on a
web page, a web browser sends a request to the web server hosting the resource to which the
hyperlink is linked. The request follows the HTTP specification, and includes the address of the
                                   5
resource that contains the link.       This can be compared to a footnote in a document, or any
other references.

Introducing a requirement to receive authorisation from the rightholder before publishing a
hyperlink to the rightholder´s website would have severe negative effects on the development
of the Internet – the infrastructure European businesses, governments, consumers and citizens
rely on every day.

It is common practice for Internet users globally to share and publish links on services such as
Facebook and Twitter, on blogs and more. To make such practice subject to the rightholders'
approval would be contrary to widely held public understanding and perception as to what is
reasonable and permissible, and would undermine the legitimacy of copyright legislation, and
disproportionately interfere with the freedom to share and access information that is otherwise

freely available on the web.        If the provision of hyperlinks were to be covered by the
rightholder's exclusive right of communication to the public, this would be in conflict with the
common perception of what is regarded as reasonable. The law would become out of line with
fundamental public perceptions of how society should be governed.           Indeed, the ability to
reference to publicly accessible information – essentially how hyperlinking operates – is a
manifestation of the freedom of speech.

First, a hyperlink is only a reference to a resource on the Internet. When a user selects a
hyperlink, the browser connects directly to the server that hosts the resource. The referring
webpage that publishes the link is not involved in the transmission between the server and the
end user. Thus, the act of hyperlinking cannot be understood in general to be part of the
transmission of the content from the server to the end user, and consequently hyperlinking is
not an act of communication to the public. On a technical level, this is true regardless of how
the hyperlink is construed.

Second, the rightholders have at their disposal a wide variety of tools to control access to the
content they make available themselves. In particular:


       The hyperlink will work only as long the content is available at the URL used in the
        hyperlink;


       A server can easily be configured to redirect any inbound deep links to, for example,
        the front page of the servers (or any other URL at the rightholders’ discretion); and


       Robots.txt is a well-established and well-functioning tool for rightholders to control how
        spiders and crawlers access their website.

Third, making hyperlinking subject to the rightholders' authorisation is not an appropriate
measure to prevent unauthorised use of protected works. Rightholders can request the host
provider to block access to infringing material. When the infringing material is taken down, any
inbound hyperlinks will not work.

Finally, and most importantly, very recently, on 13 February 2014, the Court of Justice of the
European Union ("CJEU") in Case C-466/12 Svensson held that hyperlinking to websites that
are freely accessible to all Internet users does not constitute copyright infringement.         The
CJEU's judgment that hyperlinks do not breach rightholders' exclusive right to communicate
their works to the public is to be welcomed as hyperlinks are indispensable on the Internet for
communication of the existence and location of content as we explained above. It also aligns
EU law with established case law in other jurisdictions, including the United States. While the
CJEU judgment is a significant step forward, it also raises difficult questions for the future that
would need to be closely monitored.




                                                                                                 5
As noted above, making hyperlinking subject to the rightholders' authorisation would interfere
with European citizens' fundamental freedom of speech, and would have severe implications
for the functioning of the Internet as we know it. On the other hand, rightholders already have
sufficient mechanisms to control access to their content online. Therefore, we welcome the
CJEU judgment in Svensson, and we underscore the importance of striking the proper balance
between copyright protection and the development of technology with regards to hyperlinking.


21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X NO – Please explain
As noted above, ECIS has been a champion of interoperability, and was heavily involved in the
legislative debate that led to the formulation of exceptions to the legal protection of computer
programs allowing reverse engineering in order to achieve interoperability.

Because such reverse engineering requires acts of reproduction and translation that are among
the exclusive rights of copyright owners, Articles 5 and 6 of the Software Copyright Directive
provide for exceptions to such rights. Those exceptions are the key to the Directive's real
impact as they ensure the lawfulness of reverse engineering, and hence prevent powerful
players from hindering competition and innovation. The significance and necessity of these
exceptions are underscored by the fact that they were adopted by the European Parliament on
the Directive's first reading.

First, Article 5 permits black box analysis, which generally involves some of the acts for which
only the right holder has the exclusive right. These include for instance displaying object code
on a screen or on paper in order to study it. While for certain acts it may be unclear whether
they can be considered a reproduction or not, Article 5 permits any acts comprising the process
of black box analysis apart from decompilation. For instance, a software engineer is allowed to
observe, study, or test the functioning of the program while "loading, displaying, running,
transmitting or storing the program." As a result, legitimate interoperable product developers
would face no barrier to analysing a copy of the program by observing, studying, or testing the
functioning of the program, even if it is in the legitimate possession of someone else, provided
that they have been granted the right to use the program.

Article 6 permits decompilation for purposes of developing competing as well as attaching
programs. Decompilation is permitted solely if it is the only way to obtain the information
necessary to achieve interoperability with other programs.

Both Articles 5 and 6 "embody a simple rule: Reverse engineering to study functionality is fine,


                                                                                             6
but reverse engineering to study program code, internal structure, and other expressive
aspects of the literary character of programs is forbidden, except when indispensable to
                     6
interoperability."

Finally, it is possible for rightholders to use technolοgical protective measures ("TPMs") to
"lock" computer programs in various ways that prevent reverse engineering. Thus it may be
necessary to circumvent such TPMs in order to be able to undertake lawful reverse
engineering. Therefore, in order not to diminish the effectiveness of the exceptions of the
Software Copyright Directive provided under Articles 5 and 6, the provision in that Directive
addressing circumvention of TPMs was made subject to the following exception – Article 7 of
the Directive – i.e., the provision in that Directive addressing the circumvention of TPMs in
relation to computer programs – states that it is "without prejudice" to the reverse engineering
exceptions, Articles 5 and 6 of the Software Copyright Directive.

When the Information Society Copyright Directive was proposed some six years later, its
original text did not make clear whether the Software Copyright Directive's anti-circumvention
regime or its own anti-circumvention provision (in its Article 6) applied to TPMs used in
connection with computer programs.          Had the latter applied, it could have prohibited
circumvention of such measures necessary to facilitate lawful reverse engineering.             This
uncertainty was ultimately addressed by the inclusion of Recital 50 of the Information Society
Copyright Directive, which was added after an intense battle to ensure that reverse engineering
necessary for interoperability was not prevented. Thus, Article 6 of the Information Society
Copyright Directive on circumvention of TPMs does not apply to circumvention of TPMs used in
connection with computer programs.

         "Such a harmonised legal protection [i.e., the legal protection of technological
         measures] does not affect the specific provisions on protection provided for by
         Directive 91/250/EEC. In particular, it should not apply to the protection of technological
         measures used in connection with computer programs, which is exclusively addressed
         in that Directive. It should neither inhibit nor prevent the development or use of any
         means of circumventing a technological measure that is necessary to enable acts to be
         undertaken in accordance with the terms of Article 5 (3) or Article 6 of Directive
         91/250/EEC. Articles 5 and 6 of that Directive exclusively determine exceptions to the
         exclusive rights applicable to computer programs."

In short, because of the special nature of computer programs, the European Union retains a
special regime governing circumvention of TPMs used in connection with computer programs,
which is different from the regime provided by Article 6 of the Information Society Copyright

engineering. It is therefore key that this carefully-crafted compromise is maintained, and that it
remains lawful to circumvent TPMs applied to computer programs if necessary to facilitate
                              7
lawful reverse engineering.

Both Articles 5 and 6 of the Software Copyright Directive provide for mandatory exceptions to
the protection of computer programs by copyright.             ECIS has not identified any problems
associated with the mandatory nature of these provisions.

ECIS therefore opposes any reform which would be a step back from the balance carefully
struck in the current copyright rules, and strongly believes that any initiative by the Commission
in the field of copyright should avoid altering the mandatory nature of the exception for reverse
engineering.

  Recently, in Case C-355/12 Nintendo v PC Box, the CJEU held that for a rightholder to rely on a TPM
would need to prove that (a) the use of the TPMs is proportionate, (b) other TPMs allowing software not
originating from the manufacturer to run on the consoles could not reasonably be used, and (c) the TPMs
do not have any commercially significant purpose other than to circumvent the technical protection.
Moreover, the question whether the protection of video games falls within the scope of protection afforded
to computer programs, or whether video games are protected under general copyright law as audiovisual
materials is the subject of Case C-458/13 Grund and others, which is currently under consideration by the
CJEU. Developments on this front should be carefully monitored in order to ensure that software
developers can circumvent TPMs applied to computer programs if necessary to facilitate lawful reverse
engineering.

[Open question]
The market for text and data analytics software relies on text and data mining.                   Certain
questions exist about whether text and data mining may involve some interference with the
exclusive rights of a copyright holder. Article 5 (1) of the Information Society Directive provides
for a mandatory exception with respect to temporary copies. Nevertheless, there is a view from
some quarters that data and text mining may still infringe copyright calling for significantly
tighter controls on what is permissible under European law with respect to text and data mining.

Data and text mining, or data analytics, is the computer-based extraction of excerpts of data
from digital content. Its goal is to discover hidden facts or patterns and subtle relationships in
data and inferring rules and behaviours. A key element is the linking together of the extracted
information to form entirely new, hitherto unsuspected facts or new hypotheses to be explored
further. The potential and benefits of text and data mining are very significant. McKinsey
International reports that the power of "big data" in the sphere of public sector information alone
                                                                          8
could create Euros 250 billion annual value to Europe's economy.              It is the view of ECIS that
text and data mining does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work due to its "non-
consumptive" nature. Indeed, as Professor Ian Hargreaves noted in his Report, the fact that
this use "happen[s] to fall within the scope of copyright regulation is essentially a side effect of
how copyright has been defined, rather than being directly relevant to what copyright is
                        9
supposed to protect."

ECIS cautions the Commission that text and data mining should fall outside the scope of
copyright protection.

                                                                                           10
57.      Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use
of text or data mining methods?

[Open question]

See above.



66.     How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services
(e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on
different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on
the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]
ECIS is of the opinion that cloud computing services should not be subject to copyright levies.

Applying copyright levies would have adverse consequences for the development of cloud
services in Europe, and on innovation in general. The market for cloud services is global, and
imposing a levy would put European cloud services on an unequal footing compared to cloud
services provided in the United States or in Asia.

Second, imposing copyright levies may cause imbalances even within the EU. Imposing such
levies would also hamper the digital single market, and would be at odds with the EU Treaties
and the Commission's objectives. Copyright levies are raised on a national basis by collecting
societies whereas cloud services are global.         As proven in other circumstances in which
copyright levies are imposed, the lack of harmonisation as regards the amount of levy charged
across Europe would affect competition on the merits within the internal market. It is therefore
unlikely to be any benefit from extending a system that has been proven highly problematic to
cloud services.

Finally, the imposition of a copyright levy on cloud services would raise the cost for the
provision of these services, which are on a number of occasions available for free. This would
reduce the competiveness of the economy, especially vis-a-vis the United States, which would
