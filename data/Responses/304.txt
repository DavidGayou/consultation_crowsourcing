1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than  the
one in which you live?
Ξ NO We would have welcomed the public consultation seeking  input  on  the
range, quality and attractiveness of the more than 3000 services  currently
available in the European Union[1]. The offer of online content services at
national level is plentiful and in  our  experience,  for  example  in  the
context of cable and satellite services, European  consumers  favour  their
national content options first as evidenced in  multiple  presentations  in
Working Group 1 of the Licences for Europe Stakeholder Dialogue in 2013[2].

Empirical observations of the companies active in our sector  (often  SMEs)
suggest that the obstacles to developing  an  EU-wide  presence  have  very
little to do with legal infrastructure. Rather, these obstacles are due  to
the rich cultural and linguistic diversity of  Europe  and  the  particular
economic model dictated by a European market made up of multiple languages,
cultures, local tastes and societal  preoccupations.  In  addition,  strong
regional differences  in  terms  of  broadband  infrastructure,  speed  and
preferred payment systems create further barriers which any  market  player
would need to overcome in order to build a successful EU- wide presence  in
the online environment.

Film and audio-visual content is fundamentally different from  other  types
of creative content, both from a consumer perspective and from  a  business
perspective. It is well documented that the consumption pattern  of  audio-
visual content online  in  any  national  European  culture  today  broadly
replicates the patterns  seen  with  legacy  media  such  as  cinema,  home
entertainment on digital media and  linear  television:  roughly  speaking,
consumer preference is for national  content  first,  international  non-EU
blockbusters second, and anything else  third,  including  non-national  EU
content.

In addition, a full understanding of the interlinked business relationships
which underpin the European audio-visual industry's financing,  production,
marketing and distribution practices is  critical  to  the  development  of
appropriate future policies and  legislation  in  this  area.  Unlike  many
manufactured goods, film escapes standardization and each film is a  unique
work, a prototype - each film has  its  own  business  model  in  terms  of
financing, production, marketing and distribution to audiences.  Given  the
level of financial investment required in film and audio-visual production,
marketing and distribution, most European  audio-visual  entities  seek  to
share, or outsource, the financial risk involved  in  film  production  and
distribution. This is often done  by  pre-selling  distribution  rights  by
platform, language and/or territory to entities  specialised  in  marketing
and distributing audio-visual content in the various exploitation  channels
and countries. This system serves as an elaborate  form  of  "peer-review",
and investment partners are attracted  by  the  sheer  creative  force  and
commercial potential of the audio-visual project.  Indeed,  in  many  cases
this process takes place even before the actual production/shooting of  the
film.


For further substantiation of the indispensable role in  the  financing  of
European films  played  by  pre-sales  of  future  distribution  rights  by
distribution channel and linguistic versions, see the evidence submitted to
the Licenses for Europe Stakeholder Dialogue, Working Group  1[3].  In  the
case studies presented by FIAPF/IFTA/IVF, the  contribution  to  the  total
film production budget from pre-sales  ranges  from  31  to  66  %[4].  The
contractual freedom to organize the financing and  future  distribution  of
each film in accordance with its specific business model makes it  possible
to finance European films and ensure their best possible promotion  to  the
future audience in each individual market.

As evidenced by the EU  MEDIA/Creative  Europe  programme,  European  films
often find it difficult to find an audience beyond  their  national  market
and therefore require local, specialized marketing and distribution efforts
tailored to the specific distribution channel and targeted foreign audience
to attract attention.  The  current  copyright  system  provides  no  legal
barriers to  offering  services  covering  several  territories.  But  many
elements other than copyright play a role in the degree of  development  of
online audio-visual services and their  availability  in  different  Member
States: relevant hardware penetration, broadband infrastructure and  speed,
taxation, micro-payment facilities, rules on protection  of  consumers  and
minors. The degree of availability of illegal  content  and  services  also
plays an important role in the development of a strong, sustainable  audio-
visual online offer.

Film producers are increasingly pursuing  new  opportunities  presented  by
technological developments and convergence, be it by offering  audio-visual
works online directly to end users or in cooperation  with  third  parties.
These services are bringing greater choice to consumers, both in  terms  of
content on offer and in the variety of platforms and  ways  to  access  and
consume audio-visual content. We are seeing  rapid  growth  in  the  online
market for audio-visual works in Europe, with consumer spending on  digital
online video increasing by a phenomenal  97.1%  in  2012  compared  to  the
previous year[5]. Given the  challenging  economic  circumstances  for  the
European  audio-visual  sector,  these  new  revenue  streams  are  clearly
welcome. However, the gains in revenue from digital online  video  are  not
yet able to compensate for the continued  reduction  in  revenue  from  the
physical video market.  Annual  consumer  spending  on  physical  video  is
estimated to have contracted by over €3600m compared to pre-crisis  levels,
whereas European consumer spending on digital online video amounted to just
a fraction of this in 2012, at €673.7m[6]. These  fluctuations  in  revenue
streams affect producers' capacity to finance, produce and disseminate  new
audiovisual content: less funds are available to pre-purchase future  video
publishing rights (offline and online) prior to the actual  making  of  the
film, thus affecting producers' ability to close production budgets.  There
is also a  negative  effect  on  revenues  flowing  back  into  production,
distribution  and  publishing  activities.  The  adverse  impact  of  these
developments is further reinforced by  infringement  of  producers'  rights
both in the physical and in the online environment.


Film producers do not consider online distribution of audio-visual  content
to be merely a potential future revenue stream or  as  a  way  to  amortize
investments. They are  increasingly  looking  to  new  online  distribution
channels to contribute to the advance financing of films  and  audio-visual
content in a manner similar to that already provided  by  the  pre-sale  of
rights  to  theatrical,  home  entertainment  and  television  distribution
channels. In other words, they are looking to online distribution platforms
and services to share in the financial risk of  production,  marketing  and
distribution. This is a strategic necessity in order  to  ensure  that  the
widest possible choice in terms of platforms, titles and  price  points  is
offered to consumers.

Film producers continue  to  invest  in  and  experiment  with  the  online
distribution of audiovisual content. At present, many  different  varieties
of models,  content  and  delivery  modes  are  being  explored  by  market
operators in the European Union and it remains to be seen  which  modes  of
consumption will be favoured by consumers going forward.

Many of these topics were discussed and presented in the meetings that took
place as part of the Licences for Europe structured  Stakeholder  Dialogue.
The  Joint  Statement  on  Crossborder  Portability  of  lawfully  acquired
Audiovisual Content[7] recalled that market-led initiatives are  already  a
reality in addressing demand for away-from-home  consumption  of  different
types of content, with the signatories affirming their  continued  interest
in  the  development  of  cross-border  portability  of  lawfully  acquired
audiovisual content through relevant services when  travelling  abroad  and
their willingness to continue to work towards its further development where
economically sustainable. Participants in  the  Audiovisual  Subgroup  also
held discussions on how  to  foster  cross-cultural  outreach  through  the
availability of multiple language versions of audiovisual content within  a
given territory, noting the role that EU funding programmes could  play  in
overcoming the high costs involved. It was agreed that public funding could
also play a positive role by supporting the roll-out of online  tools  that
promote the discoverability of online offers.[8]

2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have  you  faced  problems
when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?
0 JNO
The issue is one of lack of actual, sustainable consumer demand  for  cross
border  services.  Consumer  demand  focuses  on  access  to  content,  not
platforms. At present, commercial demand for  licences  to  provide  online
services across borders is negligible. Platforms and aggregators appear  to
focus on national or regional markets, assessing these to be the  pertinent
markets, at least at this stage of market development.
3. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences?
Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year  and  provide
examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the  type  of  content
concerned.


[Open question]

As mentioned above, actual demand  for  cross-border  or  multi-territorial
licences  is  extremely  limited  at   this   stage,   especially   outside
linguistically connected countries/regions. Successful online licensing and
distribution of audio-visual content depends on offering a  wide  range  of
attractive content  in  a  manner  which  is  linguistically  relevant  and
culturally attractive to local audiences. Thus, platforms  and  aggregators
focus on national or regional markets, assessing these to be the  pertinent
markets, at least at this stage of market development.

4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any  of  the  questions
above - what would be the best way to tackle them?

[Open question]

We take the view that the market is capable of finding solutions to meeting
sustained, demonstrable consumer demand for specific services.

5. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all  the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still  find
it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on  a  service
provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain  content
is not possible in certain European countries)?
Ξ YES - As set out above,  there  are  objective  reasons  for  territorial
licensing. First and foremost, this is the most efficient way to respond to
local demand which tends towards national content first and  non-EU  and/or
non-national content second, with  language  playing  a  significant  role.
Second, market and regulatory conditions vary from country to country,  de-
facto imposing territorial licensing in certain circumstances. In addition,
European audio-visual  content  is  predominantly  financed,  produced  and
disseminated in models of  joint  ventures  (co-productions)  and/or  risk-
sharing between  partners  from  different  distribution  platforms  and/or
territories.

Unlike many manufactured goods, film escapes standardisation and each  film
is a unique work, a prototype - each film has its  own  business  model  in
terms of  financing,  production  and  distribution.  Given  the  level  of
financial  investment  required  in  film  and   audio-visual   production,
marketing and distribution, most European  audio-visual  entities  seek  to
share, or outsource, the financial risk involved  in  film  production  and
distribution. This is often done  by  pre-selling  distribution  rights  by
platform, language and/or territory to entities  specialised  in  marketing
and distributing audio-visual content in the various exploitation  channels
and countries. This system serves as an elaborate  form  of  "peer-review",
and investment partners are attracted  by  the  sheer  creative  force  and
commercial potential of the audio-visual project. Indeed,  in  many  cases,
this process takes place even before the actual production/shooting of  the
film.

For further substantiation of the indispensable role in  the  financing  of
European films  played  by  pre-sales  of  future  distribution  rights  by
distribution channel and linguistic versions, see

the evidence submitted to the Licences  for  Europe  Stakeholder  Dialogue,
Working Group 1[9]. In the case studies presented  by  FIAPF/IFTA/IVF,  the
contribution to the total film production budget from pre-sales ranges from
31 to 66 %[10]. The contractual  freedom  to  organise  the  financing  and
future distribution of each film in accordance with its  specific  business
model makes it possible to finance European films  and  ensure  their  best
possible promotion to  the  future  audience  in  each  individual  market.
Focusing marketing and distribution efforts by territory enhances access by
ensuring that the widest possible range of content  is  marketed  and  made
available  at  national  level  by  specialized  entities  expert  in  each
country's specific cultural, linguistic and other specificities.

There is currently no other way in which the required  level  of  financing
can be raised in the marketplace.

For instance in regards to cross boarder portability; an online service for
The Netherlands which you have paid for in The Netherlands can be blocked
by GEO blocking when you want to access this in another EU country when
travelling. From a producers'point of view, there is a continued interest
in the development of cross-border portability as well as a willingness to
continue to work towards further development in that field. We do not
believe that it is up to the EU legislator to undertake measurements or
legislation to enforce this service for consumers or public convenience,
but to the economic operators - eg. VOD platforms- to assess whether such
business models are sustainable in light of consumers'demand.
Producers and authors, along with financiers of creative content need to be
able to recoup their investments on the creative content they invested in.
Interference of the EU will not enlarge the financing possibilities of
creative content. It will reduce the amounts which investors are willing to
pay for single territories and specifically for arthouse content in the
singe territories. It will give more possibilities for big financing
parties who are interested in content for larger audiences. This will
endanger the financing position of the arthouse content and thus threatens
Europe's cultural diversity.
It is up to the market to develop an extra service for people travelling to
be able to reach the content they want to see also while travelling.

   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?

0 N/A

   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market- led solutions) are needed at EU  level  to  increase
      the cross-border availability of


      content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate
      level of protection for right holders?

0 NO - In the absence of evidence of market failure,  there  should  be  no
legislative  or  policy  intervention  in   the   audio-visual   industry's
commercial and  contractual  freedom  with  regard  to  territoriality  and
exclusivity provisions. Imposed business models and distribution  practices
do not promote a sustainable audio-visual industry. The industry  needs  to
be  able  to  adapt  -  without  legislative  intervention  -  to  changing
commercial  and  market  conditions.  Where  there  is   demonstrable   and
sustainable consumer demand, the market will respond.

As evidenced by the EU  MEDIA/Creative  Europe  programme,  European  films
often find it difficult to find an audience beyond  their  national  market
and therefore require local, specialised marketing and distribution efforts
tailored  to  the  specific  distribution  channel  and  targeted   foreign
audience. The current  copyright  system  provides  no  legal  barriers  to
offering services covering several territories.  But  many  elements  other
than copyright play a role in the degree of development  of  online  audio-
visual services and their availability in different Member States: relevant
hardware penetration, broadband infrastructure and speed, taxation,  micro-
payment facilities, rules on protection of consumers and minors. The degree
of availability of illegal content and services  also  plays  an  important
role in the development of a strong, sustainable audio-visual online offer.

B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to
be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]

1. The act of "making available"

8. Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations
      - i.e. when content is disseminated across borders - sufficiently
      clear?

0 YES

The exclusive right of "making  available",  as  established  by  the  WIPO
Copyright Treaty and implemented in the EU by the Copyright  Directive[11],
extends to the  offering  to  the  public  of  a  work  for  individualized
streaming or downloading as well as the actual transmission of  a  work  to
members of the public - from a place and at a time individually  chosen  by
them, irrespective of the technical means used for  making  available.  The
very nature of the making available right for copyright works is such  that
it takes place both where it is offered and where it is  capable  of  being
accessed by consumers. This is a reflection of the interactive

nature of the right. This is crucial both to the licensing of  content  but
also to determining the jurisdiction and/or the applicable  law  for  right
holders  to  enforce   their   rights   against   infringers   and   online
intermediaries.

In our view, the scope  of  the  making  available  right  in  cross-border
situation is sufficiently clear,  in  particular  as  clarified  by  recent
jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)[12].  In
fact, film producers rely on the making available right on a daily basis as
a tool for licensing their content on the basis of  different  distribution
channels, linguistic versions, etc. They also rely on the making  available
right to enforce their rights online.

Any approach to the making available right that  would  artificially  alter
the inherent interactive nature of this right would  risk  undermining  its
utility as a licensing and enforcement tool. Indeed, a limitation, such  as
through the so-called "country of origin" approach, of the  scope  of  this
exclusive right would seriously diminish its value and therefore amount  to
an expropriation of a valuable property right protected  as  a  fundamental
right by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as well as
international copyright treaties. Finally, any limitation on scope  of  the
exercise of exclusive rights must also meet the conditions enshrined in the
three-step step  pursuant  to  international  copyright  treaties  and  the
Copyright Directive[13].

   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could  a  clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the "making available" right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?

Ξ YES - Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

As noted above, a "clarification"  limiting  the  scope  of  the  exclusive
making available right is neither necessary nor justified.

In the audio visual sector, the rights necessary to  finance,  produce  and
exploit a film or TV programme are generally consolidated with the producer
- the question of who is considered to be among the authors of the film  as
well as how remuneration is organised is dealt with by national law  and/or
practices. The exercising of the making  available  right  does  not  raise
issues in this connection. However, it is crucial that the producer be able
- through commercial and contractual freedom - to manage and authorise  the
distribution of the work concerned, including the distribution channel  and
the territorial scope of the rights licensed, in the optimal manner both in
terms of the exploitation of the work itself and also to the benefit of all
right  holders  in  the  collaborative  work.  As  mentioned  above,   this
commercial and contractual freedom is  fundamental  to  the  European  film
industry's financing model. European film  makers,  be  they  producers  or
authors, need to secure financing prior to the shooting of the actual film.


For further substantiation of the indispensable role in  the  financing  of
European films  played  by  pre-sales  of  future  distribution  rights  by
distribution channel and linguistic versions, see the evidence submitted to
the Licences for Europe Stakeholder Dialogue, Working Group 1[14].  In  the
case studies presented by FIAPF/IFTA/IVF, the  contribution  to  the  total
film production budget from pre-sales ranges  from  31  to  66  %[15].  The
contractual freedom to organise the financing and  future  distribution  of
each film in accordance with its specific business model makes it  possible
to finance European films and ensure their best possible promotion  to  the
future audience in each individual market.

As regards enforcement, a "country  of  origin"  approach  could  seriously
hamper right holders' ability to take legal action to address  structurally
infringing websites which are based in other Member States  or  outside  of
the EU itself (note that the operators of such sites are usually  anonymous
and thus cannot be identified or located). As a result, legal action in the
form  of  proceedings  for  injunctive  relief  is  generally  directed  at
intermediaries based on Article 8(3) of the Copyright Directive. There  are
two important conditions which must be fulfilled before a court  will  have
jurisdiction to rule under this provision (1) the subject of the  order  is
an intermediary (a very broad notion which includes access providers);  and
(2) a third party uses the intermediary's service to infringe. Once a court
has established that these criteria are met, it will then  consider  issues
related to proportionality, freedom of  expression  and  other  fundamental
rights.

Article 8(3) has become a crucial tool for right holders  to  fight  online
copyright infringements - particularly due to the  fact  that  structurally
infringing sites rarely operate openly in the EU (see the AG Opinion in the
kino.to case[16]). With respect to peer-to-peer sites, the nature  of  such
sites is that the access provider's subscribers (end-users)  will  use  its
services to infringe (since they are uploading and  downloading  infringing
content) and the structurally-infringing peer-to-peer site, which  will  be
operating  offshore  and  anonymously,  will  also  be  using  the   access
provider's service to infringe (since it  is  making  available  infringing
content)[17]. If the making available right  were  to  be  subject  to  the
country of origin doctrine, it could be difficult to show that the  website
is infringing copyright in another country where the injunction is sought -
but the damage is nevertheless significant - and therefore meets the  above
stated condition, i.e. that the site is using the intermediary's service to
infringe.  While  action  could  still  be  based   on   the   subscriber's
infringements, right holders would find their options and scope for  action
against infringing activities seriously limited.

As regards streaming sites, it would become much  more  difficult  to  show
that the end user is infringing (right holders would have to  invoke  their
reproduction right and  issues  related  to  the  possible  exceptions  for
temporary and private copies would arise - both issues are currently before
the CJEU. The potential impact of a  limitation  on  the  making  available
right is thus more pronounced.

2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

Ξ NO

It is not unusual for a single act  of  economic  exploitation  to  involve
several rights.

On-demand services generally  implicate  the  making  available  right  and
reproduction  rights.  The  reproduction  right  enters  into  play   where
platforms need to make copies to offer the protected content to the  public
(upstream), copies made on services and on users' devices as well as  where
the platform's service  involves  the  licensing  of  subsequent  permanent
copies to consumers (downstream). As  noted  above,  several  thousand  on-
demand services operate in the EU and license content on a daily basis[18].
We see this as evidence that the fact that several rights are  involved  in
individual models does not cause problems. As mentioned above, this is also
the case in the off-line environment and has not caused problems  for  film
producers who often act both as licensors of film/TV content and  licensees
of music used in the film (where applicable).

Any legislative intervention which would limit  the  scope  of  the  making
available and/or reproduction rights and  thereby  hinder  the  ability  of
audio-visual right holders to license their works would raise  issues  with
the EU's obligations under international copyright norms.

As long as all  relevant  rights  to  acts  of  economic  exploitation  are
concentrated in one hand, namely that of the producer, online  exploitation
and making available to the consumer of films is not hindered. We refer  to
a Dutch study 'Digital Obstacles' (Digitale Drempels. SEO , June 2012, page
35 http://dare.uva.nl/document/462186) which reveals that fragmentation  of
rights  with  several  parties  including  collective   rights   management
societies hinder online exploitation of film works.

 3. Linking and browsing

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

Ξ YES - Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general,
or under specific circumstances, and why

EU copyright legislation and jurisprudence generally provides the requisite
clarity on the matter of linking and browsing. National  courts  have  made
important contributions to the

understanding of the communication to the public right. The CJEU  has  also
recently provided clarification on several important fact patterns[19]. The
importance that hyperlinking plays with regard to content  delivery  online
means that a broad exclusion  from  copyright  protection  would  not  only
undermine basic licensing practices online  but  it  would  also  seriously
hinder the ability  of  right  holders  to  fight  copyright  infringements
online.

Question 11 is somewhat unclear and the answer depends to a large extent on
whether the provider of the link performs a material intervention  to  make
the content available to a new audience. The parameters are already largely
defined by CJEU judgements and this already substantial body  of  case  law
has been clarified by way of the Svensson case.[20]. Two further  decisions
are  expected   in   2014   (BestWater   International[21]   and   C   More
Entertainment[22]referrals) .

Further legislative action is not needed in this area. It is vital that the
courts retain the possibility to respond to specific fact patterns. In this
area, any legislation attempting to establish specific or inflexible  rules
for when a particular technical operation online amounts to a communication
to the public risks being outdated quickly and could remove the ability for
the courts to consider the specific circumstances  of  a  given  case.  The
complexities  and  constantly   evolving   nature   of   online   copyright
infringement are such  that  this  could  have  the  unintended  effect  of
hindering enforcement efforts - or indeed certain forms of licensing  which
operate by means of linking.

   12. Should the viewing of a web-page where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user's
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

0 YES - Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general,
or under specific circumstances, and why

For reasons similar to those stated above in the  context  of  linking,  we
take  the  view  that  current  legislation  and  the  courts  can  provide
sufficient clarity to address cases arising from specific circumstances. As
a general matter, the exclusive right of reproduction in Article 2  of  the
Copyright Directive extends to temporary reproductions. Beyond the text  of
Article 2, the CJEU has already confirmed this point[23]. The courts should
retain the possibility to consider specific circumstances to determine  for
example whether or not  the  exception  for  certain  temporary  copies  in
Article 5(1) is applicable. There may be cases  where  the  copies  on  the
screen or in the cache memory are fully covered by Article  5(1).  However,
in the event those copies  are  made  from  illegal  sources  (see  Article
5(1)(b)) the exception may not  apply[24].  This  can  be  crucial  to  the
application of Article 8(3) - it is crucial not to immunise

infringing sites from potential legal action on the basis that their  users
are not infringing copyright - even  though  the  site  is  clearly  making
available infringing copies of protected works.

4. Download to own digital content

   13. [In particular if you are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

Ξ NO

The EU  doctrine  of  exhaustion  of  rights  is  well  established  in  EU
legislation and jurisprudence - Article  3.3  of  the  Copyright  Directive
provides that the communication to the public and making  available  rights
are not exhausted. Thus, the direction of the question is somewhat  unclear
to us: the acts listed in the question are not authorized by legislation.

Licensing terms governing  on-demand  transactions,  based  on  the  making
available right and agreed contractual terms, that grant usage  rights  and
prohibit the resale of digital files - particularly where the  consumer  is
made aware of these terms in advance before purchase - are transparent  and
necessary to sustain such business models.

There is an important link between the making available right  and  Article
6(4)(4) of the Copyright Directive. Where  a  work  is  made  available  on
demand on agreed contractual terms, Member States cannot intervene to limit
- including  exhaust  -  the  exclusive  right.  In  the  absence  of  this
provision, many business models would not be sustainable. The current legal
framework is an enabler of multiple online  business  models,  specifically
designed to the online environment, including  the  economic  viability  of
offering films in this distribution channel.

   14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.

The EU  doctrine  of  exhaustion  of  rights  is  well  established  in  EU
legislation and jurisprudence and has  played  an  important  role  in  the
development of the single market with regard to  tangible  copies  and  the
distribution right. While the CJEU has provided some further  clarification
in the UsedSoft[25] and TV Catchup[26] decisions, the concept  of  "digital
exhaustion"  presents  radically  different  issues  that  go  well  beyond
tangible copies and the distribution right. Instead, both the  reproduction
and making available rights are at issue, none  of  which  are  subject  of
exhaustion under EU law. The ruling in UsedSoft cannot be extended directly
to making available of works other than computer  programs,  since  it  was
issued under the


Computer Programs Directive[27]. Moreover,  Usedsoft  "cannot  remedy  that
there is no exhaustion of the reproduction right"[28]. Providing  otherwise
would  raise  serious  issues  under  international   copyright   treaties,
including the three steps test.

There is an important link between the making available right  and  Article
6(4)(4) of the Copyright Directive. Where  a  work  is  made  available  on
demand on agreed contractual terms, Member States cannot intervene to limit
- including  exhaust  -  the  exclusive  right.  In  the  absence  of  this
provision, many business models would not be sustainable. The current legal
framework is an enabler of multiple online  business  models,  specifically
designed to the online environment, including  the  economic  viability  of
offering films in this distribution channel.

If the online market place is to  thrive,  right  holders  must  retain  an
ability to manage new business  models  based  on  creative  licensing  and
innovative new offers. Despite good faith intentions, it is not possible to
verify and/or manage transfers of digital content.  A  regime  of  "digital
exhaustion" based on a concept of "forward and  delete"  is  unworkable  in
practice. Indeed, digital exhaustion has no place in an environment that is
increasingly based on licensing access to protected works and  cloud  based
services.

C Registration of works and other subject matter - is it a good idea?

   15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?

0 NO

Considerable  progress  has  been  achieved  by   industry   and   relevant
stakeholders in the  development  of  publicly  accessible  registries  and
databases of information about works,  authors/related  right  holders  and
other data that make it significantly faster, cheaper and easier accurately
to identify right holders in a wide range of works.

Our organizations support the aims behind various international initiatives
to  embed  data  into  audiovisual  works  in  order  to  facilitate  their
identification. Identifiers such as the International Standard  Audiovisual
Number (ISAN - www.isan.org) is now an ISO standard in this  area  and  may
provide  useful  shorthand  to  identify  works,   thus   adding   to   the
technological tools to facilitate  back-catalogue  management  and  content
protection efforts. ISAN and the other identifier, Entertainment Identifier
Registry  (EIDR  -  www.eidr.org)  prove  there  is  already  advanced  and
constructive efforts across the audiovisual sector  in  making  information
about the identity and contact points for right holders  more  broadly  and
expeditiously available, and in facilitating identification  and  licensing
of works in the digital environment.


Most important however: In the audiovisual sector,  the  centralisation  of
rights with the producer means that there is less demand for  the  creation
of a repository of ownership and license information compared to some other
copyright industries. In any event, any registration system and/or database
must remain voluntary, both for practical reasons and in  order  to  be  in
line with international norms.

  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

We do not believe that  an  EU  level  registration  system  could  provide
advantages over and above current audiovisual industry efforts in the field
of identifiers. Irrespective of the nature of  registration  systems,  they
must be cost-effective, robust and  secure,  subject  to  being  constantly
updated, deploy state of the art technology and have  effective  anti-fraud
measures in place.

  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

In the absence of robust fraud detection and a means of constantly updating
information to ensure its accuracy and legitimacy, registration systems can
be used to infringe or misappropriate rights or simply mislead.

  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

Any incentives to right holders would have to flow from  benefits  inherent
in the registration system itself. Incentives linked to  protection  and/or
enforcement of rights will not be compatible with  international  copyright
norms.

D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

  19. What should be the role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption  of
      identifiers in the content sector, and in  promoting  the  development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

As mentioned above, two main identifier systems are currently used  in  the
audiovisual sector: the  ISO-labelled  International  Standard  Audiovisual
Number (ISAN - www.isan.org)  and  the  Entertainment  Identifier  Registry
(EIDR - www.eidr.org).

Our organisations appreciate the efforts  of  the  European  Commission  in
promoting a joint declaration on the role of identifiers and  the  inherent
value  of  interoperability  between  the  two   identifiers   [29].   This
declaration has been discussed and adopted  within  the  framework  of  the
Stakeholder Dialogue Licences for Europe. It is a strong  signal  from  the
industry  concerned  to  promote  further  dissemination  of  the  use   of
identifiers as well as interoperability between the two main identifiers.


The role of the EU should be to  continue  to  facilitate  discussions  and
encourage marketplace solutions to interoperability  as  suggested  by  the
declaration.

Given the efforts and progress in the private sector achieved in particular
thanks to Licenses for Europe, we do not believe the case has been made for
any further EU intervention in this space other than the promotion  of  the
use of identifiers for  works  benefiting  from  support  of  the  Media  /
Creative Europe programme that was recommended by the Joint Declaration.

E. Term of protection - is it appropriate?

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
   digital environment?

Ξ YES

We see no reason why terms of copyright protection should be  different  in
the digital environment. Irrespective of  whether  the  copyright  work  is
produced for and disseminated in the analogue or the  digital  environment,
the costs of developing, creating, producing,  marketing  and  distributing
the work are such that an adequate period of time is required to recoup the
investment. Creative contributors' efforts are the same as are the economic
risks involved in  the  production,  marketing  and  dissemination  of  the
protected work.

The current terms of protection are appropriate. We oppose  any  initiative
to shorten or even modify terms of protection.  Such  efforts  would  raise
serious issues under the EU Charter  on  Fundamental  Rights  and  Freedoms
where the right to private property, as well as the right to protection  of
intellectual property (Art. 17), is guaranteed.

At the time of  the  adoption  of  the  Directive  extending  the  term  of
protection for the related rights of music performers and producers[30], we
were opposed to a similar  initiative  in  the  audio-visual  sector.  This
remains our position. At the time, the Commission's impact  assessment  had
not considered the audio-visual sector, even in  passing.  It  acknowledged
that the two sectors are fundamentally different and respond  to  different
cultural and commercial imperatives: "Audio-visual performers and producers
are not considered, as their economic and legal situation is  significantly
different. This concerns their legal status as well as the  assignment  and
transfers of their rights." We believe that the situation has  not  changed
and no term extension is required for audio-visual works.

III Limitations & Exceptions in the Single Market

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and
   exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the
   Member States?


0 NO. The Copyright Directive sets  forth  an  exhaustive  list  of  twenty
exceptions and  limitations.  The  current  regime  of  one  mandatory  and
otherwise optional exceptions allows for a flexible and  proportionate  use
of protected works  and  an  adequate  degree  of  harmonisation  has  been
achieved. This legislative approach of optional exceptions with some  scope
for  Member  State  flexibility  in  the  national  implementation  is  the
appropriate legislative choice in a time of rapid technological development
and everyday launch of new models for  distribution  of  protected  content
online. This approach is also in line with the principle  of  subsidiarity.
We are not aware of any practical problems that have arisen with respect to
the optional nature of the exhaustive list of exceptions.

With  the  current  options,  EU  Member  States  may,  in  line  with  the
subsidiarity  principle,  decide   themselves   which   limitation   and/or
exceptions they believe are best  suited  to  serve  the  public  interest,
foster economic growth and preserve cultural heritage and diversity.

At the same time, a significant degree of  convergence  between  the  legal
systems of the Member States has developed due to EU legislation. Moreover,
the CJEU  plays  an  important  clarifying  role  by  providing  a  uniform
interpretation of exceptions. The application of the three-step test  is  a
key element in ensuring that a fair  balance  is  achieved  between  users'
interests and right holders' exclusive rights.

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is
   there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

0 NO - The current structure offers flexibility and represents an effective
working compromise. If limitations and exceptions were made mandatory, many
Member States which do not provide for certain exceptions in their national
law, would be required to implement new exceptions, many of which would  be
alien to their current legal system, culture and  traditions.  Furthermore,
as the  Member  States  would  then  be  required  to  transpose  mandatory
limitations and  exceptions,  they  would  also  need  to  implement  those
limitations and exceptions, where the CJEU has not yet provided  a  uniform
interpretation. At present, EU and international law gives EU Member States
the vital  and  necessary  degree  of  flexibility  which  is  particularly
important in view of the different legal systems and traditions of  the  28
Member States.

We continue to question the evidence of the need  to  make  exceptions  and
limitations mandatory - the case for mandatory exceptions  has  simply  not
been made. In fact, the current EU  Copyright  framework  -  including  the
optional approach for exceptions and limitations - provides  the  necessary
flexibility for  promoting  both  creativity  and  innovation  as  well  as
important protection of the resulting works. This is evidenced by the sheer
volume of new works available -  and  the  abundance  of  new  devices  and
delivery systems through which works can be accessed and enjoyed throughout
the European Union.


23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from
   the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

0 NO - There is no need to add or to remove  any  of  the  limitations  and
exceptions in the Copyright Directive. The case for new exceptions has  not
been made. Copyright has and continues to evolve in Europe. Where there  is
evidence of market failure or regulatory  flaws  and  there  is  sufficient
consensus, solutions have been found (e.g. the Orphan  Works  Directive[31]
and the forthcoming Directive on Collective Rights Management).  Periodical
evaluations of copyright law and how it is functioning to achieve its  aims
are important. However, evidence for the need to change must be provided by
those who seek such change. We do not believe that such evidence  has  been
produced.

Copyright should  continue  to  serve  the  public  interest  by  fostering
incentives to create, finance, market and distribute new works and to  make
those works available to the public in new and innovative, compelling ways.
The three-step[32]  test  remains  a  flexible  and  pragmatic  legal  tool
providing legislators and courts with the necessary room for manoeuvre when
framing and interpreting exceptions and limitations.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
   a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for
   limitations and exceptions?

0 NO - As mentioned above, flexibility is already an important component of
the EU Copyright Acquis. In between national copyright systems and  the  EU
Copyright Acquis, there exists a fair amount of margin  to  manoeuvre.  The
Copyright Directive, underpinned by recent jurisprudence of  the  CJEU,  is
itself innovative. In the field of online search and social networks, which
has experienced massive growth in recent years, it should be noted that  no
EU legislation or judicial decisions have undermined, let alone  prevented,
the launch and/or sustainability of such services and  activities.  The  EU
legal framework, including the Copyright and the E-Commerce Directives[33],
has provided sufficient scope to allow new Internet companies and platforms
to thrive economically without specific regulation.

Given the flexibility afforded to Member  States  by  the  current  system,
where national copyright systems and the Copyright  Directive  coexist  and
are underpinned by the jurisprudence of the CJEU, there  appears  to  be  a
more than  sufficient  amount  of  flexibility  to  foster  innovation  and
accommodate developments in technology,  new  uses  and  changing  consumer
demand.

25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility?
   (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions
   of the directives, interpretations by


   the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a  fair-use  or
   fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what
   would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as
   well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

See above in Question 24.

Although it is often asserted that a 'fair use' doctrine could provide more
flexibility  than  the  European  system  of  predefined   exceptions   and
limitations, 'fair use' has its own disadvantages, including in  particular
legal uncertainty. Fair use is determined on a case-by-  case  basis,  each
case being examined on its merits thereby making a priori analysis hard  to
predict. Courts are required to consider each of the four statutory factors
relevant to establishing 'fair use'[34], but Congress and  the  US  Supreme
Court have made it  clear  that  "no  generally  applicable  definition  is
possible" [35]. Each case must be determined on its own facts.

The European system of pre-defined exceptions and  limitations  corresponds
better to the legal tradition of the great majority of European  countries.
Indeed, even the  UK  system,  which  is  underpinned  by  the  common  law
tradition, tends toward more specificity in the statute. In  addition,  the
three-step test (as mentioned above) also grants a measure  of  flexibility
to national legislators and  the  courts.  This  is  borne  out  by  recent
judgments of the CJEU.

26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in   your
   experience, constitute a problem?

0 NO - Due to the territorial nature of copyright, the question of  whether
or not a particular limitation or exception is relevant to a  specific  act
of exploitation is a matter for the law of the country where protection  is
sought (generally where the use in question is taking place).  This  system
brings a significant degree of clarity - recent decisions of the CJEU  have
also played a role in this area.

We are not aware of problems in this area. The  production  of  audiovisual
content is dealt  with  by  contract,  licensing  arrangements  and  rights
clearances, which can  take  account  of  differences  in  limitations  and
exceptions in different territories. Indeed, multiple local law  variations
are accommodated by the market place on a daily basis.

27. In the event that limitations and  exceptions  established  at  national
   level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of  "fair
   compensation" be  addressed,  when  such  compensation  is  part  of  the
   exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)


Based on international norms and EU law, such  uses  would  be  subject  to
compensation by the user in the country of where the use takes place.
A. Access to content in libraries and archives 1. Preservation and
archiving
28. (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
   experienced specific problems when trying to use an exception to preserve
   and archive specific works or other subject matter in your collection?
   (b) [In particular if you are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
   problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments, museum or
   archives of the preservation exception?

0 NO. Film producers are committed to the  preservation  of  Europe's  film
heritage and to providing  access  to  it  for  cultural,  educational  and
research purposes. Film producers deposit film and film materials in all EU
Member States, either by way of legal (mandatory) deposit  rules  or  under
voluntary deposit arrangements with film  heritage  institutions.  In  this
connection, we would like to draw attention to the framework  agreement  on
voluntary  deposit  with  film  heritage  institutions,  which  FIAPF  (the
International Federation of Film Producers' Associations) entered into with
European film heritage institutions already in 1972, and which was recently
updated to take into account the digital environment[36]. More recently, in
the context of the Commission's "Licences  for  Europe"  initiative,  FIAPF
worked  together  with  representatives  of  film  heritage   institutions,
audiovisual authors and collective management organisations to agree upon a
Statement of Principles and Procedures[37] which will  be  recommended  and
promoted by its signatories as a tool  to  facilitate  discussions  on  the
relevant terms for digitisation  and  access  to  European  cinematographic
heritage works conserved in European film heritage institutions.

We  note  that  many  right  holders  commit  important  resources  to  the
preservation, restoration and digitization of their works with  a  view  to
providing access to the film heritage,  be  it  of  European  or  of  third
country origin. It is important to recognize  right  holders'  intellectual
property rights, i.e. private property rights, in their  works  and  ensure
coordination of efforts by right holders and film heritage institutions  to
avoid duplication and to ensure the optimal deployment of resources.

29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved? (Open question)


As mentioned above, right holders and cultural heritage institutions have a
long-standing practice of identifying  and  addressing  issues  related  to
preservation, archiving and access in close cooperation  through  framework
agreements and other voluntary initiatives.

30. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
   its main elements?  Which  activities  of  the  beneficiary  institutions
   should be covered and under which conditions? (Open question)

There is no need for a legislative solution.  Right  holders  and  cultural
heritage institutions have a  long-standing  practice  of  identifying  and
addressing issues related to preservation, archiving and  access  in  close
cooperation through framework agreements and other voluntary initiatives.

31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would  it  be?
   (Open question)

Right holders and  cultural  heritage  institutions  have  a  long-standing
practice of identifying and  addressing  issues  related  to  preservation,
archiving and access in close cooperation through framework agreements  and
other voluntary initiatives.

2. Off-premises access to library collections
32. (c) [In particular if you are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
   agreements with institutional users that  enable  those  institutions  to
   provide remote access, including across borders, to the  works  or  other
   subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private
   study? (Open question)

   The 2010' FIAPF-ACE Framework Agreement on Voluntary Deposit of Films  in
   European  Preservation  Archives  provides   for   the   possibility   of
   negotiating remote access to works  subject  to  voluntary  deposit  with
   European film archives who are members of ACE [38]

33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved? (Open question)

   Right holders and cultural heritage  institutions  have  a  long-standing
   practice of identifying and addressing issues  related  to  preservation,
   archiving and access in close cooperation  through  framework  agreements
   and other voluntary initiatives.

34. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
   its main elements?  Which  activities  of  the  beneficiary  institutions
   should be covered and under which conditions? (Open question)


See above: There is no need for a legislative solution. Right holders and
cultural heritage institutions have a long-standing practice of identifying
and addressing issues related to preservation, archiving and access in
close cooperation through framework agreements and other voluntary
initiatives.

35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would  it  be?
(Open question)

See above: Right holders and cultural heritage institutions have a long-
standing practice of identifying and addressing issues related to
preservation, archiving and access in close cooperation through framework
agreements and other voluntary initiatives.

3. E-lending

36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced  specific
   problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the  electronic
   lending  (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  of  books  or   other
   materials held in your collection?

b) [In particular if you are an end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
   specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books  or  other  materials
   electronically (e-lending), including across borders,  from  institutions
   such as public libraries?

c)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
   agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or other materials
   electronically, including across borders?

In our view, there is no need for legislative intervention  in  this  area.
Indeed, there is a need to proceed  with  the  utmost  caution,  given  the
experience with public libraries' lending of copyright content on  physical
carries. In some instances, such public lending - especially  when  offered
at no fee - could seriously impede exploitation  of  the  same  content  in
commercial channels. We favour contractual arrangements negotiated  between
right holders and public libraries so that all relevant aspects,  including
the potential impact on commercial exploitation, may be taken into  account
and be addressed satisfactorily.

We note that there may also be  examples  in  the  market  place  of  right
holders wishing to make their collections or catalogue  directly  available
for the public[39].

37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]


We favour contractual arrangements negotiated  between  right  holders  and
public libraries so that all  relevant  aspects,  including  the  potential
impact on commercial  exploitation,  may  be  taken  into  account  and  be
addressed satisfactorily.
38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:]  What  differences  do
   you see in the management of physical and online  collections,  including
   providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

      N/A

39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference  do  you  see
   between   libraries'   traditional   activities   such   as   on-premises
   consultation or  public  lending  and  activities  such  as  off-premises
   (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending?  What  problems  have
   you encountered?

[Open question]

Currently we have not seen problems in  daily  practice.  However,  caution
should be given  that  public  libraries'  new  activities  (online,  at  a
distance) could seriously  impede  exploitation  of  the  same  content  in
commercial channels.

Mass digitisation

40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting  to
   engage in mass  digitisation  projects,  a  right  holder,  a  collective
   management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to  enact
   legislation to ensure  that  the  results  of  the  2011  MoU  (i.e.  the
   agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have  a
   cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed  across
   the EU?
N/A to audiovisual works.

41. Would it be  necessary  to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
   agreed for other types  of  content  (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
   collections, broadcasters' archives)?
We do not believe that the approach developed for print works in  the  2011
MoU referenced in  Question  40  is  appropriate  for  audio-visual  works.
Therefore, FIAPF has worked together with representatives of film  heritage
institutions, audio-visual authors and collective management  organisations
to agree upon a Statement of Principles and Procedures[40]  which  will  be
recommended and promoted  by  its  signatories  as  a  tool  to  facilitate
discussions on the relevant terms for digitisation and access  to  European
cinematographic  heritage  works  conserved  in  European   film   heritage
institutions.


We are therefore supportive of initiatives which foster the  conclusion  of
voluntary licenses which  can  enable  cultural  heritage  institutions  to
fulfil their public interest missions. This benefits all  stakeholders  and
society as a whole. The use of the presumption of all  rights  vested  with
the producer, and equitable remuneration for the creators,  has  proven  in
The Netherlands a helpful means for mass digitisation  of  old  film  works
(Filmotech Netherlands).

Teaching

42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an  institutional
   user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or
   other subject-matter for  illustration  for  teaching,  including  across
   borders?
   (b) [In particular if you are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
   specific problems resulting from the way in which works or other subject-
   matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

We support the educational use of film  materials  in  particular  for  the
study of film in schools and note that the use of copyright  works  in  the
context of teaching and education is already dealt with in Articles 5 and 6
of the Copyright Directive. These trike the appropriate balance -  both  by
allowing the Member States the  flexibility  to  implement  exceptions  for
illustration for teaching purposes as  well  as  by  encouraging  licensing
solutions negotiated  with  right  holders[41].  The  necessary  limits  to
protect this balance and ensure the incentive create new works  is  set  by
three-test step at the EU and international levels.

Thus,  In  the  audio-visual  sector,  the  EU  Copyright  Acquis   permits
educational  institutions  to  reproduce  and  communicate  to  the  public
materials in the context  of  both  face  to  face  teaching  and  distance
learning. The limitation of the use of materials  to  "illustration"  means
that the generalised making available of copyright  materials  to  distance
learners needs to be supplemented by licensing agreements. While film clips
could be used to illustrate teaching materials, it would not be permissible
to make a complete feature films available to remote students in a  course,
for  example,  on  film  history,  except  where  such  an  arrangement  is
authorized/licensed  by  the  relevant  right  holders.  Apart   from   the
limitative effect of the reference to "illustration", the  three-step  test
would not be satisfied. Such use would not amount to a "special  case"  and
would conflict with the normal exploitation of the film through  commercial
online services or other home entertainment distribution channels. However,
institutions which require  broader  use  of  such  materials  can  explore
licensing alternatives with  the  relevant  right  holders.  The  scope  of
Article 5(3)(a) reflects the need for right holders to be in a position  to
negotiate  at  arms-length  with  entities  that  are  making  their  works
available online - such negotiations include  a  wide  range  of  important
terms, for example concerning robust technological protection measures.

Apart from that, we are not aware that in practice problems  have  occurred
for end users or institutional users for educational purposes.  We  believe
and know that there is good

practice and that this is dealt with between rights owners  and  end  users
via schools/universities and/or film  festivals  (e.g.  International  Film
Festival  Rotterdam,  The  Netherlands  Film  Festival,  the  International
Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam and Cinekid). Also public  broadcasters
investing in film and audio-visual work usually stipulate that these  works
can be used for educational purposes.  So  no  examples  of  problems  have
occurred to our knowledge.

C. Research

47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an  institutional
   user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or
   other subject matter in  the  context  of  research  projects/activities,
   including across borders?
   (b) [In particular if you are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
   specific problems resulting from the way in which works or other subject-
   matter are used in the context of research projects/activities, including
   across borders?

   a and b NO

   The EU Copyright  Acquis  provides  the  necessary  scope  for  important
   research activities and achieves the appropriate balance with the need to
   encourage and incentivise the creation of new copyright works.
   We support national  exceptions  that  further  the  public  interest  in
   promoting academic studies and, in particular, film  studies.  Again,  we
   must stress the importance of licensing

   schemes. Such arrangements permit  right  holders  to  address  important
   issues  such  as  security  of  the  copyright  content  subject  to  the
   arrangement.

48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

   Not applicable

  49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of
      content for research purposes? How successful are they?
   No examples known D. Disabilities

50. (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
   organisation  representing   persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you
   experienced problems with  accessibility  to  content,  including  across
   borders, arising from Member States' implementation of this exception?
b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for  persons
   with    disabilities:]    Have    you    experienced    problems     when
   distributing/communicating works published in special formats across  the
   EU?
c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced  specific
   problems resulting from the  application  of  limitations  or  exceptions
   allowing for the distribution/communication of works published in special
   formats, including across borders?

We support the need to provide practical solutions to facilitate the access
to audio-visual content for users with disabilities. Special subtitling and
audio description tools are increasingly  made  available  for  audiovisual
content. The Copyright Directive contains several  provisions  relevant  to
promoting access to users with disabilities, for example,  Article  5(3)(b)
allows for different kinds  of  uses  and  illustrates  that  the  flexible
approach taken by the Directive can be adapted to the various categories of
copyright works, forms of distribution, and especially  to  the  particular
needs of disabled persons and their individual disability. Any new separate
mandatory provision, for  example  providing  for  an  obligation  to  make
available content  in  a  particular  format  would  be  incompatible  with
technological developments over time and would be ill  adapted  to  meeting
the different current and future needs of  individual  disabled  users.  In
general, individual and flexible contractual solutions are best  suited  to
achieve the objective of better accessibility of audio-visual  content  for
users with disabilities.


It is our view that the EU Copyright Acquis is already compliant  with  the
recently adopted WIPO Marrakech Treaty for the Visually-Impaired. [42]  The
Copyright  Directive  provides  the  necessary  flexibility  to  enable  EU
signature and ratification.

51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

In general, individual and flexible contractual solutions are  best  suited
to achieve the objective of better accessibility  of  audio-visual  content

[Open question]

JOINT ANSWER TO QUESTIONS 53 TO 57
We recognise that non-commercial data-mining would appear to  be  a  useful
tool particularly in the field of research. It is already  permitted  under
the Copyright Directive which provides for exceptions for research (Article
5(3)(a)).

However, an exception for commercial data-mining  would  not  be  permitted
under the Copyright Directive and for good reason. Such an exception at  EU
level would raise serious issues and potentially  conflict  with  licensing
schemes developed in particular by publishers. Moreover, to the extent that
any exception might encompass search  engine  and  indexing  activities  in
general, there is a risk  that  it  could  become  a  defence  deployed  by
infringing sites.

C. User-generated content

58.  (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
   experienced problems when trying  to  use  pre-existing  works  or  other
   subject matter to disseminate new  content  on  the  Internet,  including
   across borders?
b) [In particular if you are  a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
   problems when users publish/disseminate new content  based  on  the  pre-
   existing works or other subject-matter through  your  service,  including
   across borders?

c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced  problems
   resulting from the way the users are using pre-existing  works  or  other
   subject-matter to disseminate new  content  on  the  Internet,  including
   across borders?
0 NO

The EU Copyright Acquis provides sufficient flexibility  for  users  to  be
able to generate  and  disseminate  new  content,  including  incorporating
protected content. Various mechanisms exist which have been put in place by
stakeholders (such as content-sharing platforms  as  well  as  increasingly
micro-licensing possibilities). We are supportive of efforts  and  industry
initiatives for industry-led solutions to issues arising in  this  context.
Industry initiatives exist

in this field[43], and there are multiple sites offering content created by
users operating unimpeded in the EU at mass market levels.

Discussions within the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue confirmed
that usergenerated content services  are  thriving  under  the  flexibility
offered by the EU Copyright Acquis. The existing legal framework was  shown
to provide effective solutions for  the  user-  case  scenarios  that  were
presented to the Working Group,  and  there  is  an  increasing  number  of
licensing schemes and agreements[44]. Indeed, film producers have  embraced
many of the tools offered by social media and social networking sites, with
many offering content such as film clips and stills which users  can  post,
edit (e.g. movieclips.com) or embed on websites.

59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a  right  holder:]
   Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure  that  the  work  you
   have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) is properly  identified
   for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?
   (b) [In particular if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
   possibilities for users that are publishing/disseminating the works  they
   have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service to
   properly identify these works for online use?

N/A

60. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right  holder):]
   Have you experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for  the  use
   of the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
   (b) [In particular if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
   remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating  the  works  they
   have created (on the basis of preexisting works) through your service?

N/A
62. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
   its main elements? Which activities should  be  covered  and  under  what
   conditions?
We do not consider that there is a need for  further  legislation  in  this
field. Copyright  is  the  driving  force  behind  innovation  and  the  EU
Copyright Acquis provides a sufficient degree of  flexibility  for  a  wide
range of technological developments.  However,  opponents  of  the  current
system  of  exceptions  and  limitations  argue   that   their   need   for
"flexibility" is such that they need to be able to operate businesses based
on the exploitation of the copyright

works of others without having to obtain licenses (i.e., for free or  under
wide-ranging  exceptions),  allowing  those  services  and  businesses   to
monetize advertising and users' data without paying the customary price for
the content that drives the traffic to the  service.  This  results  in  an
unjustified and  detrimental  transfer  of  wealth  that  deprives  content
producers and distributors  of  a  fair  return  on  their  investment  and
consumers of compelling content as decreased revenues for content producers
and distributors invariably result in less investment, including  the  jobs
and tax revenues stemming from that investment.

According to some, this alleged lack of flexibility is the explanation  for
a deficiency in European Internet companies - when in reality  a  range  of
other important factors are at play and may better explain  the  situation.
These include varying degrees of access to venture capital, risk  aversion,
R&D expenditure, social legislation,  taxes,  and  bankruptcy  laws,  among
others. Moreover, the EU Copyright Acquis has not  prevented  international
Internet companies from enjoying, in a number of  prominent  cases,  market
shares in the EU that are even higher than those achieved elsewhere in  the
world.

63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
   In our view, there is no evidence of problems which require a legislative
   solution. There are multiple industry initiatives - developed with a view
   to addressing issues arising in different content sectors - which involve
   new services and options while at the same time respecting copyright.

IV Private copying and reprography

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
   application of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the
   digital environment

0 NO
The language of the Copyright Directive itself is clear and recent case law
has provided additional clarification.  Article  5.2(b)  provides  that  on
condition that the following conditions are met, acts  of  private  copying
may be covered by the exception: "reproductions on any medium by a  natural
person for private use and for ends that are neither directly or indirectly
commercial, on condition that the rightholders  receive  fair  compensation
which takes account of the application or non-application of  technological
measures...". Specific reference is made to copies undertaken "by a natural
person for private use". As a result, copies made by a third party, or  for
a third party, are excluded from the scope of the private copy exception as
set out in Article 5.2(b) as are reproductions  made  by,  for,  or  within
legal entities. Finally,  appropriate  legal  protection  of  technological
measures as required by Article 6 of the Copyright Directive must  be  made
available  under  national  law.  Appropriate  legal  protection   includes
protection  for  access  and  copy  controls,  prohibition   of   acts   of
circumvention  and  preparatory  acts  of  circumvention   accompanied   by
effective sanctions.


The digital distribution of copyright works can be effectively  managed  at
source through technology or content management solutions, and payment  can
be made directly. This presents a vast range  of  opportunities  for  right
holders to engage in direct  licensing.  As  DRM-enabled  licensing  offers
greater efficiency and reduced costs, it benefits electronic  commerce  and
end-users. An example is cloud-based technologies, or  digital  lockers  in
the cloud, which have boosted the  direct  exercise  of  exclusive  rights.
Because legal copies in the cloud will invariably be licensed copies, there
is no basis to apply levies. To  the  extent  that  technological  measures
permit the direct exercise of the exclusive  right  of  reproduction,  this
benefits not only all right holders  and  licensees  (authors,  performers,
producers, distributors and publishers), but  also  the  market  place  for
copyright works in general and the end-users,  who  benefit  from  a  wider
choice of business propositions at different price points (no  copies,  one
copy, multiple copies, etc.).

65. Should digital copies made by end users  for  private  purposes  in  the
   context of a service that has been licensed by  rightholders,  and  where
   the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be  subject  to  private  copying
   levies?

0 NO

As mentioned above, the digital distribution  of  copyright  works  can  be
effectively managed at source  through  technology  or  content  management
solutions, and payment can be made directly. This presents a vast range  of
opportunities for right holders to engage  in  direct  licensing.  As  DRM-
enabled licensing offers greater efficiency and reduced costs, it  benefits
electronic commerce and end-users. An example is cloud-based  technologies,
or digital lockers in the cloud, which have boosted the direct exercise  of
exclusive rights. In such cases copies in the cloud are licensed copies and
then there is no basis to apply levies. To the  extent  that  technological
measures permit the direct exercise of the exclusive right of reproduction,
this  benefits  not  only  all  right  holders  and   licensees   (authors,
performers, producers, distributors and publishers), but  also  the  market
place for copyright works in general and the end-users, who benefit from  a
wider choice of business propositions at different price points (no copies,
one copy, multiple copies, etc.).

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the  application  to  online
   services (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for  instance,
   users to have copies on different devices)  impact  the  development  and
   functioning of new business models on  the  one  hand  and  rightholders'
   revenue on the other?

As mentioned above, legal copies in the cloud will invariably  be  licensed
copies, and there is therefore no basis to apply levies. To the extent that
technological measures permit the direct exercise of the exclusive right of
reproduction, this benefits  not  only  all  right  holders  and  licensees
(authors, performers, producers, distributors and publishers), but also the
market place for copyright works in general and the end-users, who  benefit
from a wider choice of business propositions at different price points  (no
copies, one copy, multiple


copies, etc.).

67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible  on  the  invoices
   for products subject to levies?

0 NO - Although transparency is generally the preferred approach,  any  new
"display" obligation must also take into account the cost-effectiveness  of
the proposition. Any  new  obligation  should  avoid  placing  unreasonable
burdens on the market system as the application of  such  requirements  may
ultimately result in additional costs being passed on to  retailers  and/or
end-users.

It is probably undesirable to require vendors by law to display the  amount
of the levy, not only because it will increase costs for vendors, but  also
because users may be led to think that in some sense they have paid for the
"right" to use the equipment for making  copies  from  any  source.  It  is
important to  safeguard  the  principle  that  the  private  copy  levy  is
compensation for use which falls within  the  scope  of  the  private  copy
exception and where the relevant conditions are met (see  above  under  our
reply to Question 64).

68. Have you  experienced  a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
   resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same  levy,
   or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

   N/A

69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to  persons  other
   than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to  private  copying?
   Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please explain  in
   detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of  transaction,
   stakeholders, etc.).
   (Open question)

   N/A

70. Where such undue payments  arise,  what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
   affect?  To  what  extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
   reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help to  remedy  the
   situation?
   (Open question)

71. If you have identified specific problems with  the  current  functioning
   of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?

V Fair remuneration of authors and performers

72. [In particular if you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
   mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that  you  receive  an
   adequate  remuneration  for  the   exploitation   of   your   works   and
   performances?

Remuneration of relevant right holders is a legitimate  concern  and  there
are understandable preoccupations as to how remuneration models may operate
under  an  audio-visual  value  chain  in  which  online  distribution  may
eventually play a more important role.  Any  future  policy  in  this  area
should be  evidence-based  and  designed  on  the  basis  of  finding  real
solutions  to  real,  evidenced  problems,  thus  avoiding  upsetting   the
remuneration mechanisms evolved over many years through negotiation between
producers and authors or performers at national level.

The virtue of the current model, in which economic rights are vested in the
producer or representative agent, is  that  it  allows  for  the  licensing
process to  remain  streamlined  and  expedient.  This  practical  economic
dimension  should  be  borne  in  mind  before  considering  any  statutory
modification  to  what  is  a  delicate  equilibrium  based  on   pragmatic
adjustment to business realities,  national  traditions  and  long-standing
collective bargaining arrangements in some countries.

Though important in its own right, remuneration  of  all  contributors,  be
they creators or other contributors to the collective work, is only one  of
the strategic issues pertaining to online distribution and the  adjustments
it will require. Of equal importance is the question of  how  transactional
online distribution and publishing  can,  in  the  long  run,  develop  the
economic capability to  be  actively  involved  in  the  financing  of  new
creative content.

A for instance mandatory remuneration model for authors and performers  for
future online distribution would fail to acknowledge the need for a broader
return  on  investment  necessary  to  make  the  audio-visual  production,
financing and exploitation sector sustainable and to support the very  high
costs attached to the development, production, marketing  and  distribution
of new audio-visual content.

The establishment  of  an  EU-level  "national"  remuneration  right  -  if
subjected to mandatory collective licensing - would create  yet  a  further
layer of collective management  and  administration  fees.  The  uptake  of
online distribution services will be  handicapped  by  such  an  additional
layer of administration. Such a system would serve further to undermine the
value of copyright  online  by  fuelling  the  current  misconception  that
copyright is a mere right to remuneration, leaving the weight of  the  film
production pre-financing responsibilities  on  the  "classic"  distribution
channels (theatrical, physical carriers, TV).

As a general matter, no right  holder  should  be  forced  into  collective
management/licensing except in cases where exclusive rights are subject  to
mandatory collective administration for  reasons  of  practicability  under
relevant international law. Such cases are the exception (as in the case of
cable retransmission), not the rule.


At  EU  level,  the  list  of  film  authors  is  harmonised  by  the  Term
Directive[45]  which  provides  that  the  principal  director   shall   be
considered as the author or one of  the  authors  (with  a  list  of  other
authors for the purposes of measuring term of  protection).  Member  States
can designate other authors (in Germany, the list is open  and  depends  on
the level of creative contribution). Member States can also designate legal
entities as the author (e.g., UK and Ireland). This of  course  raises  the
question of which authors  would  benefit  from  a  statutory  remuneration
right: would it be the  principal  director,  just  the  list  of  possible
authors in the Term Directive, or should the question be  left  up  to  the
Member States? Any action limiting the scope of the making available  right
would in our view raise  questions  about  the  legality  of  the  European
Union's implementation of the WIPO treaties. A statutory remuneration right
subject to mandatory collective licensing would also greatly  diminish  the
value of the exclusive right centralised with the producer by operation  of
law and/or contract. The  end  result  is  a  limitation  on  the  author's
exclusive right - and a diminishing of the value of the rights  the  author
can  transfer  to  producers  -  which  is  potentially  inconsistent  with
international norms. Collecting societies administrating  the  remuneration
rights will seek payment from the platforms (not the production companies).
This takes money out of the marketplace. Producers and  distributors  would
find that the platforms were willing to pay less for the content -  and  to
the extent residuals (supplementary payments over  and  above  the  initial
lump sum remuneration) were already being paid pursuant  to  individual  or
collective agreements, authors  and  performers  would  be  getting  double
payments. Measures to avoid double payment  risk  further  diminishing  the
value of the author's exclusive right.

73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit
   certain clauses in contracts)?

0 NO - see our reply above to Question 72.

Basically the current legal framework of vesting the ecomomic  rights  with
the producer works sufficiently. It is crucial that measures on EU level do
not hinder or frustrate the  present  existing  legal  presumption  of  the
transfer of these rights to the producer (as confirmed by  the  EU  CoJ  in
Luksan/Van der Let), in order the keep the business of film &  televisision
making healthy.'

74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would
   you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

We consider the current rules as  effective.  They  allow  film  producers,
authors and

performers alike to be flexible, innovative  and  act  in  accordance  with
their national traditions, employment cultures, and industry structures.

VI Respect for rights

75. Should  the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
   efficient for infringements of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
   purpose?

As a general matter, we support strict and  efficient  enforcement  options
against commercial scale infringements.

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow  for
   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet  service
   providers, advertising brokers, payment service  providers,  domain  name
   registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online  copyright  infringements  with  a
   commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to  foster  the
   cooperation of intermediaries?

0 YES - Though on the whole Article 8(3) of the Copyright Directive  is  an
effective  tool  in  achieving  cooperation  from  intermediaries   against
copyright infringement, a critical problem is that some Member States still
have not implemented this provision and the corresponding provisions in the
Enforcement Directive[46] in a correct manner.

A  second  point  is  that  right  holders'   cooperation   with   Internet
stakeholders in the  fight  against  online  infringements  is  also  often
frustrated by the fact that Internet intermediaries generally do not record
client data or they record inaccurate client data. Internet  intermediaries
such as domain name providers, hosting providers,  payment  providers,  and
online ad-brokers should be subject to  "know  your  customer"  obligations
(see Article 5 of the  Enforcement  Directive)  and  the  money  laundering
Directives. In particular, right holders should have  the  legal  means  to
identify and locate commercial scale infringers. The CJEU has confirmed  in
LOreal v. eBay [47]that infringers operating in the course of trade must be
identifiable. See paragraph 142 in L'Oreal v. eBay. The existing  EU  "know
your customer" (KYC)  legislation  (see  3rd  Money  Laundering  Directive)
applies to banks, lawyers, real estate agents, casinos and we suggest  that
it should also be made applicable  to  Internet  intermediaries.  Anonymous
businesses prevent the legal system from working in  a  fair  and  balanced
manner.

77. Does the current civil  enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
   balance is achieved between the right to have one's  copyright  respected
   and other rights such as the protection of private life and protection of
   personal data?


0 Yes. The CJEU has clarified in several recent decisions (Promusicae, [48]
LOreal v. eBay and Sabam v. Netlog [49]) as well as  the  AG  to  the  CJEU
(Kino[50]) that national courts shall apply the proportionality  test,  and
that they have to weigh all fundamental rights before coming to a fair  and
balanced decision. In doing so, the courts  shall  take  into  account  the
rights and interests of the parties and stakeholders concerned.

Given the breath of case law on this  topic  and  the  fact  that  national
courts are effectively  applying  the  required  balancing  of  fundamental
rights, including the right to property, there are sufficient safeguards in
place to ensure fair and balanced decisions.

VII A single EU Copyright Title

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU  Copyright  Title,
   as a  means  of  establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
   exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework  for
   enforcement?

0 NO. - The introduction of  a  European  Copyright  Code  or  an  optional
Unitary Copyright Title is very unlikely to produce  the  intended  results
and might in fact take decades to achieve given the differing views  across
the EU. Copyright is protected as part of the fundamental right to property
under the EU legal order. As a result, proposals to  reform  the  copyright
framework in this way could raise a number of complex issues. For  example,
there could be a possible conflict of laws were an  EU  Copyright  Code  to
result in expropriation  of  property  that  is  protected  under  national
constitutions.

It is our view that introducing a new Regulation on a "Community  Copyright
Title"  alongside  national  titles  would  add  an  unnecessary  layer  of
complexity. Simply replacing  current  national  systems  with  a  European
Copyright Title would appear premature and too complex for the reasons  set
out above.

79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the  EU?
   Does the current level of difference among the Member  State  legislation
   mean that this is a longer term project?

The option to replace national laws by an EU Copyright Code would  probably
take years, if not  decades,  to  achieve.  The  EU  Acquis  is  extensive,
flexible and perfectly sufficient. Any action is only justified where there
are evidence-based, proven negative  effects  on  the  functioning  of  the
internal market, of which there are none. European and international law

gives EU Member  States  the  necessary  degree  of  flexibility  which  is
particularly  important  in  view  of  the  different  legal  systems   and
traditions of the 28 Member States.

VIII Other issues

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework
   for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be
   addressed.
Final remark: we are not convinced that there  is  sufficient  evidence  of
need for a substantial change or review of  the  EU  Copyright  Rules.  The
conclusion that such need exists seems to  have  been  reached  before  the
consultation has been carried out and all contributions assessed.
