QUESTIONS 1 a 7



        1.  [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced
           problems when trying to access online services in an  EU  Member
           State other than the one in which you live?


        2.  [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have  you  faced
           problems when seeking to provide online services across  borders
           in the EU?


           BNE: NO
           Comments: No problems have been encountered  since  the  digital
           objects available at our  digital  library.  We  only  face  two
           exceptions:


               ▪ Sound recordings, which are only  allowed  to  be  listened
                 in streaming. This kind of availability  is  linked  to  an
                 agreement  with  authorised  collective  rights  management
                 association.


               ▪  Collection  of  contemporary  engravings  donated  to  the
                 Library. Such collection is  protected  under  intellectual
                 property rights; hence it  can  only  be  accessed  at  the
                 library facilities.


        3. [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder  or  a  collective
           management organisation:]How often are you asked to grant multi-
           territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible,  the  number
           of requests per year and provide examples indicating the  Member
           State, the sector and the type of content concerned.


           BNE comments:
           So far, request haven´t been related to the granting  of  multi-
           territorial licenses. The most similar case  which  is  becoming
           more usual day would be the request of reuse of digital  objects
           available at digital library:


               ▪ Submitted  by  individuals  either  for  personal  purposes
                 (educational sites, lessons; personal blogs…) or publishing
                 (either printed or online formats)


               ▪  Submitted  by  commercial  providers  (online  editors  or
                 distributors) to offer our content through their  platforms
                 and/or apps. Most of them leave on the library’s  side  the
                 decision of offering this content for free  or  charging  a
                 fee. So far, it seems that library’s position would  always
                 be the free option.


        4. If you have identified problems in the answers  to  any  of  the
           questions above – what would be the best way to tackle them?

        5. In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder  or  a  collective
           management organisation:]  Are there reasons why, even in  cases
           where you hold all the necessary rights for all the  territories
           in question, you would still find it necessary or  justified  to
           impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order,
           for instance, to ensure that access to certain  content  is  not
           possible in certain European countries)?


        6. [In particular if you  are  e.g.  a  broadcaster  or  a  service
           provider:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where  you  have
           acquired all the necessary rights for  all  the  territories  in
           question, you would still find  it  necessary  or  justified  to
           impose territorial restrictions on  the  service  recipient  (in
           order for instance, to redirect  the  consumer  to  a  different
           website than the one he is trying to access)?


           BNE: YES
           Comments: By this answer  we  want  to  convey  not  that  these
           restrictions are necessary but  that  this  is  a  reality  that
           libraries are dealing  with very often.
           In fact, libraries are  facing  agreements  with  third  parties
           which in exchange of supporting digitisation  oblige  to  impose
           territorial  restrictions.  Although  those   restrictions   are
           limited in time, such agreements are considered polemic  because
           they   are   limiting   access   to   public   domain   material
           (contradicting the guidelines outlined at the Comité  des  Sages
           Report).These limits our role as cultural public institutions to
           open up access to Heritage. Anyway, it might be  understandable,
           to a certain extent that these partners need  to  recover  their
           investments


        7.  Do  you  think  that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-
           legislative, including market-led solutions) are  needed  at  EU
           level to  increase  the  cross-border  availability  of  content
           services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate  level
           of protection for right holders?


QUESTION 8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border
situations – i.e. when content is disseminated across borders –
sufficiently clear?

BNE comments:
The targeting approach is too vague and dependent on market decisions.

Once technologies or agreements have been set up in  order  to  provide  for
the “making available” right the situation might have already change.  Right
holders (or at least those in charge of its management)  should  put  up  in
place a data base where the target country was publicly known,  as  well  as
its conditions. Arrow and OIHM databases projects are examples of, at  least
apparently, overlapping approaches.

Some limits should be considered when restricting public access to  specific
countries. Once access is opened up, conditions of access should be  similar
amongst countries which have access to the content.


Rights clearance for different right holders of  the  same  work  should  be
eased, especially for public cultural institutions.  It  should  be  avoided
the need for putting in place several agreements for a single kind  of  work
(E.g.: right clearance of a sound recording could entail the setting  up  of
three different agreements one for authors, one for performers  and  finally
one for phonogram producer. EU legislation should  work  for  achieving  the
“bundling of rights”, especially in the online/digital environment.













QUESTION 9.  [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a
clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have
an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are
considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the
enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief )


QUESTION 10.  [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:]
Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation
in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

BNE: Yes
Comments: “Bundling of rights” should be definitely achieved, avoiding the
need of applying for several licences.

Digital preservation activities undergone by public cultural/heritage
institutions should be specifically mentioned among the exceptions to right
holders. The activities needed for preserving a single work could imply
several actions, and possibly some of them are still unknown. Being this
the situation, it might be recommendable that whenever these processes were
to be included in legislation they should be distinguished by their aim,
considering them just as one with just one aim: preservation (e.g.:
reproduction=safety copy, communication and distribution=transmission among
servers, transformation=migration of format…)


QUESTION 11.     Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or
other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under
specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


QUESTION 12.     Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the
temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under
copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer,
either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
authorisation of the rights holder?


QUESTION 13.  [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you
faced restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have
purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

BNE: NO
Comments: Have not tried so. Maybe the “2nd hand market” is  something  that
should not be applied to digital  environment  as  in  the  analogical  one.
Firstly, the original rights should be expired to allow doing  so;  if  not,
maybe an specific licence for reselling should be  issued,  a  request  that
should be addressed to the right holder.
What it should be assured is the permanent access to a  purchase.  Once  the
purchase of a digital content has taken place, access should  be  permanent.
Once seller, distributor, cannot provide for this it should allow  purchaser
to take all actions necessary for assuring permanent access.



QUESTION 14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service
provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework
enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify
per market (type of content) concerned.


BNE comments:
If  we  sold  our  content  to  a  third  party  with  higher  technological
abilities, access to our content through our platforms could be affected  in
a negative way, especially if such party performs better. Agreements  should
be put up in place to reassure a win-to-win relationship.


QUESTION 15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level
help in the identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?



QUESTION 16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]

BNE comments:
Some of advantages could be; transparency and a easier management of right
Clearance tasks, especially if this is accompanied by a bundling of rights.
The amount of  information  about  right  holders  available  to  all  users
including cultural heritage  institutions  will  increase,  ad  it  will  be
easier to check the copyright status of works (Europeana position).


QUESTION 17.  What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]


QUESTION 18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be
envisaged?


[Open question]


BNE comments:
One of the most obvious would be: direct and real time access to the
conditions of exploitation of their works.


QUESTION 19.     What should be the role of the EU in promoting the
adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the
development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions
databases?
[Open question]

BNE comments:
The main role could be the creation of a single  point  for  retrieving  and
linking these identifiers. In order to get this it should coordinate and  be
responsible for having updated information  about  all  theses  initiatives;
limiting the appearance of new ones, promoting the use of just  a  selection
and/or reassuring that new ones are mapped to the already existing ones.
It should be highly recommendable avoiding the reinvention of the wheel,  as
mentioned before, e.g: Arrow database for orphan works  and  OHIM  database.
It is not clear enough if such projects will be fused  into  one;  at  first
sight seems obvious, although don’t know if feasible



QUESTION 20.     Are the current terms of copyright protection still
appropriate in the digital environment?


BNE: NO
Comments: As LIBER states the terms of protection in  Europe  (currently  70
years) should be reduced to the minimum established by the Berne  Convention
(life of creator plus 50 years).
Longer copyright terms exacerbate the issue of orphan works, generated  when
owners cannot be founded or identified.
Terms of protection must be shorter especially  in  the  audiovisual  sector
-50 years- after the first performance/broadcasting/recording  in  order  to
improve benefits for performers and producers.
It might be fair that producers were not considered  equal  to  authors  and
performers with regards to the length  of  terms  of  protection.  Producers
should have shorter terms of protections.
There should be limits to the continuously extension of term of  protection,
especially because this should protect author rights, not his/her heirs.
Sometimes  collective  management  associations   have   more   restrictions
regarding the management of copyright  than  original  right  holders  have.
E.g., we  have  experienced  this  problem  when  dealing  with  photographs
collections, as heirs and the collective right management association  offer
different agreements: although heir allowed us to  open  up  access  to  the
images  through  our  digital  library,  once  management  of  rights   were
transferred to collective right management association the situation  became
more difficult and unclear.
Contracts must have more advantageous terms for the cultural institutions
in order to avoid prevailing rights clauses of collective right management
entities.

QUESTION 21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations
and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the
Member States?



QUESTION 22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if
so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?



QUESTION 23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or
removed from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to
specific cases.

BNE: YES
Comments: Digital preservation should be specifically added.
Separate pictorial, drawings, prints, graphic, and photographs works etc .,
should also be included in legislation on orphan works.


QUESTION 24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to
provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework
for limitations and exceptions?.






QUESTION 25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for
flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic
revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in
flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative
advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible
effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.


QUESTION 26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your
experience, constitute a problem?

BNE: YES
Comments: It leads to lack of harmonisation, misinterpretation  and/or  gaps
of legislation. This results in a weakness  position  for  those  which  are
poorly advised (in legal terms), in general this is  the  position  cultural
institutions have.


QUESTION 27. In the event that limitations  and  exceptions  established  at
national level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question  of
“fair compensation” be addressed, when such  compensation  is  part  of  the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

BNE comments:
Rights   management   collective   associations   should   have   a   single
international voice so to ease  cross-border  management.  But  such  single
voice shouldn’t be taken as an  empowered  role.  The  entity  or  institute
which tries to access  should  pay  to  this  single  representation;  there
should be a system of a balance distribution of this compensation.  Cultural
institutions should do have a privileged role, and have the right  to  lower
fees of compensations in order to reassure access.


QUESTION 28.  (a) [In particular if you are  an  institutional  user:]  Have
you experienced specific  problems  when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
preserve and  archive  specific  works  or  other  subject  matter  in  your
collection?
(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?



BNE: YES
Comments: Digital Library has not faced this issue as is mainly  focused  on
public domain. Although no problems  were  encountered  in  the  collections
with copyright as contemporary  engravings,  or  out-of-commerce  works,  at
least  in  relation  with  digital  preservation,  when  these   items   are
digitalized, as a part of cultural  projects  or  for  the  conservation  of
originals, only thumbnails or access in Library premises is allowed.

It is  true  that  we  haven’t  faced  yet  digital  preservation  tasks  of
materials that include TPM/DRM measures (software,  audiovisual  materials).
Our current IP legislation includes a very weak  exception  for  this  issue
(article 161, 1 f), it should be checked the applicability

Web harvesting: some right holders might have not  allowed  harvesting.   In
the National Library of Spain we have not  had  any  problems  with  rights,
because actually we only  track  what  is  public  on  the  web.  Only  were
received two or three complaints that have nothing to do  with  intellectual
property, but with interference that the performance of the robot  collector
caused in the operation of the crawled servers,   or  other  incidents,  but
not related to rights. It is not necessary to ask  permission  for  tracking
webs because we are protected by the law and the  collected  items  have  no
rights at all. When Electronic Legal deposit legislation becomes effective


QUESTION 29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]


QUESTION 30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what
would be its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary
institutions should be covered and under which conditions?
[Open question]


BNE comments:
Exceptions for digitalization and open access to orphan  works  and  out  of
commerce works have to be included.

Separate pictorial, drawings, prints, graphic, and photographs  works  etc.,
should also be included in legislation on  orphan  works.  Legal  regulation
will avoid  that  digitalization  and  access  became  costly  for  cultural
institutions.


QUESTION 31.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what
would it be?
 [Open question]

QUESTION 32. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
rights holders that enable you to provide remote access, including across
borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of research
and private study?

BNE YES
Comments:
Although obviously our public mission, amongst others, is giving  access  to
our collections (digital or analogical), we are  not  very  sure  about  the
feasibility of broadening the exception 5.3.n  regarding  licensed  content,
opening remote access to it. Specially, because this could end in  library’s
liability  of  copyright  infringement  or  it  might   go   against   Berne
convention.

Some examples: Contemporary engravings  (IP  rights  management  bodies  are
trying to hinder off-premises access, even to thumbnails).  Currently  users
can access to a lower image just if they are  within  library  premises;  if
they’re not they would only have access to thumbnails. The collective  right
management associations want to charge the library a fee, even  for  showing
the thumbnails at  the  library  facilities.  Unbalanced  conversations  are
being held;  by  “unbalanced”  we  want  to  convey  the  fact  that  always
regarding legal issues cultural institutions are in  a  weak  position  when
discussing with these entities.

The problem is also  extended  to  modern  press  collections    and  out-of
commerce  works  whose  consultation  is  highly   demanded,   as   heraldic
collections







QUESTION 33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

BNE comments:
            Although showing thumbnails  of  a  specific  digital  protected
collection might entail  reproductions  and  public  communications  rights,
those should be considered as an exception e.g with aim of illustration.
Generally speaking we would need broader exceptions.

QUESTION 34.     If your view is that a legislative solution is needed,
what would be its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary
institutions should be covered and under which conditions?
[Open question]


QUESTION 35.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what
would it be?
[Open question]



QUESTION 36 (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the
electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or other
materials held in your collection?

BNE Comments:
Although the library hasn’t faced yet this issue  we  find  there  would  be
uncertainty about  our  rights  to  lend  a  digital  work  entered  in  our
collection through legal deposit.


QUESTION 37.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]




QUESTION 38.     [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What
differences do you see in the management of physical and online
collections, including providing access to your subscribers? What problems
have you encountered?
[Open question]


QUESTION 39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do
you see between libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises
consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises (online,
at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you
encountered?
[Open question]



QUESTION 40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or
wanting to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a
collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country
to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a
cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across
the EU?


BNE: YES
Comments: Legislation which eased the endeavouring of such a digitisation
project would be welcome, following examples as those encountered in France
and Germany.


QUESTION 41..    Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those
already agreed for other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual
collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

BNE: YES
Comments: Legal frameworks, agreements similar to those mentioned  regarding
out of commerce works; following French example.
Also a more ambitious  regulation  for  orphan  works:  separate  pictorial,
drawings, prints, graphic, and photographs works etc., should  be included.


QUESTION 42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an
institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to
use works or other subject-matter for illustration for teaching, including
across borders?


QUESTION 43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]


QUESTION 44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the
use of content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are
they?

BNE comments:
Initiatives  such  as  Creative  Commons  licences,   Wikipedia,   MOOC   at
universities  or  other  educational  /research  institutes,   open   access
initiatives, institutional repositories; all these tools are proving  to  be
crucial for teaching purposes.
Sources such as online  databases  of  images,  sounds  are  also  a  really
valuable tool. However sometimes they use  confusing  concepts,  definitions
which might imply doubts about the right to use or  not  a  digital  content
e.g :clearanced right content, managed right images on internet …In the  end
sometimes is not clear when you have to pay or not,  and  above  all  if  no
fair use/exceptions could be claimed


QUESTION 45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what
would be its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary
institutions should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]

BNE:
Our comment would be similar to that expressed for question 32.

QUESTION 46.  If your view is that a different solution is needed, what
would it be?


QUESTION 47.  (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an
institution user: ] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to
use works or other subject matter in the context of research
projects/activities, including across borders?



QUESTION 48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?




QUESTION 49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the
use of content for research purposes? How successful are they?

BNE comments:
Initiatives  such  as  Creative  Commons  licences,   Wikipedia,   MOOC   at
universities  or  other  educational  /research  institutes,   open   access
iniciatives, institutional repositories.
They do help and will prove to be more useful everyday. However the  effects
of them are too incipient to conclude their success.




QUESTION 50. [In particular if you are an organisation providing services
for persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems when
distributing/communicating works published in special formats across the
EU?


BNE: YES
Comments:
At our digital library is offer  Readspeaker  software.  Such  functionality
produces a sound archive from the OCR text of a modern print book.  Although
is quite a good tool, dissimilar quality of OCR content hinders  its  global
implementation…Our lack of resources hinders  the  retrospective  generation
of pdf and OCR to improve the situation.
We also experience lack of resources so to implement  specific  policies  to
open up content to persons with disabilities  (e.g  at  digital  library  we
should launch an specific project focused on complying with a minimum  level
of accessibility)

QUESTION 51. if If there are problems, what could be done to improve
accessibility?


BNE comments:
Implement an specific project for accessibility (human and economic
resources needed for that purpose). Such a project would entail (in a very
synthetic manner):
   1. Validation with WCAG utilities so to gather all needs and improvements
      needed.
   2. Accomplish developments to comply with a minimum level of
      accessibility ans implement those developments and/or improvements.
   3. Retrospective generation of OCR files to improve accessibility.

QUESTION 52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate
accessibility to content? How successful are they?


BNE comments:
Some of them: WCAG validators? OCR software? Software specially developed
for disabled people e.g. Screen readers, Readspeaker?
We just have experience with Readspeaker. Our own level of satisfaction is
quite high, but is true that we are aware of its limitations, and we have
not conclusive satisfaction indicators

QUESTION 53.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an
institutional user:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to copyright,
when trying to use text or data mining methods, including across borders?

BNE: NO
Comments:
Still haven’t faced this issue, anyway our legislation regarding reuse of
public information is still too young to have properly tackled this issue.


QUESTION 54.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

BNE comments:
As CENL recommends, given this  computer-based  technology  offers  enormous
potential  to  speed   up   life-changing   scientific   discovery,   create
significant organisational savings for libraries and private  companies,  as
well as to create many other forms of economic value,  existing  limitations
and exceptions should be extended to explicitly cover the technique of  data
mining. Without this the innovation, productivity and growth that  can  come
from harnessing the full potential of big data will never be realised.

Anyway we still have no  experience  if  our  technological  infrastructures
would  be  ready  for  being  targeted  by  these  technologies.  Biblioteca
Nacional de  España  (BNE)  meets  the  National  Security  Scheme  (Esquema
Nacional  de  Seguridad,  ENS)  (RD.3/2010,  which  regulates  the  National
Security Scheme in the e-Government Scope).

The ENS purpose is to define the security policy on the  use  of  electronic
means and consists of basic principles and minimum  requirements  to  ensure
suitable protection of information

QUESTION 55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what
would be its main elements? Which activities should be covered and under
what conditions?

BNE comments:
Although we don’t disagree 100% with the opening  up  posture  of  Europeana
regarding all type of digital content independently of the  aims  of  reuse;
we would like to highlight that, currently, the library  hasn’t  decided  if
commercial,  non  commercial   purposes   should   be   distinguished   when
authorizing reuse o digital content. Policies are still under study.

QUESTION 56.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what
would it be?

QUESTION 57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that
constitute barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

58. a 60  No answer

QUESTION 58. (b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you
experienced problems when users publish/disseminate new content based on
the pre-existing works or other subject-matter through your service,
including across borders?

QUESTION 59. (b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you
provide possibilities for users that are publishing/disseminating the works
they have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service
to properly identify these works for online use?

QUESTION 60. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide
remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?

QUESTION 61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?.


BNE comments:
Our legislation should be more flexible so to allow  us  the  generation  of
income reassuring us that we could put up in place win to win agreements.
.
QUESTION 62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what
would be its main elements? Which activities should be covered and under
what conditions?


BNE comments:
Legislation should convey us with enough autonomy and legal entity so to
generate income and be able to use as part of our own budget.
.
QUESTION 63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what
would it be?


QUESTION 64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the
scope and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions  in
the digital environment?


BNE comments:
The  Member  States  have  different  legal   approaches   –exceptions   and
limitations-. Increased level of harmonisation is required.

Spain, for example, is waiting for the approval of a reformed  text  of  the
IP law that provides a complete revision of private copying.

The draft also rejects the current system of compensation based in  a  canon
for equipment and storage media. The decision has been widely criticized  as
produce a distortion in the internal market  as  in  Spain  rates  for  this
concept will be 0.  IP rights compensation will  be  charged  to  the  Stage
Budget. The new regulation  clarifies  that  only  private  copying  may  be
carried out by individuals and not by professionals or companies .Also  adds
that work from which private  copy  is  taken  has  to  be  acquired  always
through commercial sale.


QUESTION 65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes
in the context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and
where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying
levies?

BNE: NO
Comments:
When it comes to on line services based on licensed agreements it  does  not
seem justified make consumers pay a second time, in form of levies.
Double payment has to be avoided, especially where  thre  is  no  commercial
use. (According to Antonio Vitorino recommendations 31/1/2013)


QUESTION 66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application  to
 online services (e.g. services based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the  development
and functioning of new business models on the  one  hand  and  rightholders’
revenue on the other?




QUESTION 67. Would you see an added value in making levies  visible  on  the
invoices for products subject to levies?




BNE comments:
Levies should be made visible for the final customer.  It  would  be  easier
for collecting societies to  collect  the  correct  amount  of  levies  from
retailers. Such a measure would also make the system  more  transparent  and
raise awareness among consumers.
(According to Antonio Vitorino recommendations 31/1/2013)


QUESTION  68.  Have  you  experienced  a  situation  where  a   cross-border
transaction resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the
same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?



QUESTION 69 a 71


BNE comments: No information available


                 69.   What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold
                 to persons other than natural persons for purposes clearly
                 unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
                 result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the
                 example you provide (type of products, type of transaction,
                 stakeholders, etc.)
                 70.   Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of
                 trade do they affect? To what extent could a priori
                 exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in
                 some Member States help to remedy the situation?
                 71.   If you have identified specific problems with the
                 current functioning of the levy system, how would these
                 problems best be solved?



QUESTION 72. [In particular if you are an author or/performer:] What is  the
best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive  an
adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?




QUESTION 73. Is there a need to  act  at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to
prohibit certain clauses in contracts)?



BNE: YES
Comments:
EU should support with stronger signs the open access which sometimes  might
be hindered by the agreements between authors and  scientific  publications.
The transfer of rights should take into account the rights of the author  to
deposit his/her work at institutional repositories. Anyway, remuneration  to
authors shouldn’t be responsibility of public cultural  institutions,  their
role is reassuring the access to culture and knowledge so to avoid  cultural
gap among the society.





QUESTION 74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what
would you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?




QUESTION 75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered  more
efficient  for  infringements  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
purpose?.




QUESTION 76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to
allow for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
service providers, advertising brokers, payment  service  providers,  domain
name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would  be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries?



BNE: YES
Comments:
 LIBER states that  any  legislation  dealing  with  intermediaries  on  the
Internet has to be extremely clear and well thought-through.

Any  organisation  with  a  public  policy  function  like  a   library   or
educational establishment should not be treated as an  intermediary  of  any
description.


QUESTION 77. particular, is the current legal  framework   clear  enough  to
allow for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
service providers, advertising brokers, payment  service  providers,  domain
name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would  be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries?



QUESTION 78.  Should  the  EU  pursue  the  establishment  of  a  single  EU
Copyright Title, as a means  of  establishing  a  consistent  framework  for
rights and exceptions to copyright across  the  EU,  as  well  as  a  single
framework for enforcement?



BNE: YES
Comments:
The implementation of an EU single legal framework would  ensure  a  minimum
of rights to all authors in all member states, and  would  have  a  positive
effect for the unification of the European legal regulation.

It  might  ease  rights  clearance  and  minimize   the   need   for   legal
interpretation, but  uneven  economic,  legislative,  and  awareness-raising
level of users, authors and managing collective  entities  relating  to  the
respect of rights in the EU countries  would  make  difficult  harmonisation
proposals and also delay the adoption of a single EU copyright title.


QUESTION 79. Should this be the next step in the  development  of  copyright
in the EU? Does the current level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
legislation mean that this is a longer term project?



BNE: YES
Comments:
Yes, it would likely take decades to develop. The project  to  achieve  such
uniformity should be planned on  a  long  term  basis  to  facilitate  their
implementation.

Cultural organizations would have great interest on  the  development  of  a
single EU Copyright Title, considering the proposal as  a  priority  subject
in order to clarify the legal framework at European Level.

Other collectives as European publishers (FEP) are most  interested  in  the
enforcement of existing rules, and other solutions such as the  MOU  on  Key
Principles on the  Digitisation  and  Making  Available  of  Out-of-Commerce
Works signed by all stakeholders concerned. Users  and  consumers,  e.g.  in
Spain, are more concerned about the  reduction  of  the  limits  of  private
copying and to avoid any cost associated to contents  on  line,  since  they
benefit  of   the  legal  ambiguity  of  the   transposition   of   European
Directives.



QUESTION 80. Are there any other important matters related to the  EU  legal
framework for copyright?  Please  explain  and  indicate  how  such  matters
should be addressed



BNE: YES
Comments:
LIBER  recommends  raise  this  issue   and   express   the   opinion   that
education/research/library exceptions  cannot  be  “trumped”  by  individual
contracts.

Contracts/licences agreements with publishers should never  be  the  way  of
avoiding compliance with IP legislation, specially in  terms  of  exceptions
and fair use.
