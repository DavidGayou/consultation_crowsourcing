   I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[1].

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[2] should significantly facilitate the delivery of  multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for   online   services[3];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue  “Licences  for  Europe”[4]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[5].

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[6].

Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level  in  the  medium  term[7]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.

                                1.  [In  particular  if  you  are  an   end

                                   across borders in the EU?

                                   to  grant  multi-territorial   licences?
                                   Please indicate, if possible, the number
                                   of  requests  per   year   and   provide
                                   examples indicating  the  Member  State,
                                   the  sector  and  the  type  of  content
                                   concerned.

In the book sector, the issue of territoriality is  fundamentally  different
of the other sectors. The author gives a licence directly to  the  publisher
for the commercial exploitation of a book. Publishers  usually  acquire  and
manage worldwide exclusive rights for books in a specific  language  (except
for European publishers from  English  speaking  countries  who  acquire  at
least pan-European licenses). For example, a Lithuanian publisher  can  sell
the book in Lithuanian to readers of Lithuanian all over Europe  because  no
other publisher will get a licence for  the  same  language.  As  a  result,
publishers can sell books  through  online  or  brick-and-mortar  retailers,
across the whole internal market without  limitations.  For  sales  of  both
physical books and e-books the current practice is individual management  of
rights, as European publishers generally acquire the digital rights as  well
as the analogue ones. There are no issues of  split  rights  in  publishing.
When a collective work  is  concerned,  publishers  are  considered  as  the
authors and gather all rights. In  principle,  any  European  reader  should
therefore be able to buy any e-book sold by any e-distributor
                                4. If you have identified problems  in  the

                                   them?

                                   even in cases where  you  hold  all  the
                                   necessary rights for all the territories
                                   in question, you  would  still  find  it
                                   necessary   or   justified   to   impose
                                   territorial restrictions  on  a  service
                                   provider (in  order,  for  instance,  to
                                   ensure that access to certain content is

Some technical issues due to a very  nascent  market  (less  than  1%  in  a
majority of EU countries, 13% in the UK,  3%  in  France  and  Germany)  can
occur which can limit the licence to some regions, however this is  not  the
rule and rarely occurs in the print sector. In anticipation  to  forthcoming
new VAT rules which foresee that from January 2015 VAT should  be  collected
in the country of consumption, we  foresee  some  difficulties  due  to  the
need to identify where the sales will take place. FEP  is  willing  to  work
together with booksellers on this issue and wishes to get  the  Commission’s
support. In Spain 3,6€

                                7.  Do  you  think  that  further  measures
                                   (legislative     or     non-legislative,
                                   including  market-led   solutions)   are
                                   needed at EU level to increase the cross-
                                   border availability of content  services
                                   in the Single Market, while ensuring  an
                                   adequate level of protection  for  right
                                   holders?

NO

FGEE does not expect particular measures needed  at  EU  level  to  increase
cross-border availability of books, print and  e-books,  within  the  single
market,  however,  it  encourage  the  Commission  to  support  in   finding
technical solutions to identify the country of sales for VAT  purposes  (see
question 5) and the interoperability of devices, platforms and  content.  We
would expect the Commission to impose a must  carry  obligation  on  devices
and platform to provide for interoperable services.



Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]

The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established  by  Directive  2001/29/EC[8]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection  of  software[9]
and databases[10].
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[11] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.

The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[12],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[13].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[14]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.

                                8. Is the scope of the  “making  available”
                                   right in cross-border situations –  i.e.
                                   when  content  is  disseminated   across
                                   borders – sufficiently clear?

NO


We consider that clarity is required as  to  what  constitutes  a  copyright
relevant act and where it is produced (whether the  country  of  destination
or country of origin principle should apply to the making available  right).


                                9.  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right
                                   holder:] Could  a clarification  of  the
                                   territorial   scope   of   the   “making
                                   available” right have an effect  on  the
                                   recognition of your rights (e.g. whether
                                   you are considered to be  an  author  or
                                   not, whether you are considered to  have
                                   transferred your rights or not), on your
                                   remuneration, or on the  enforcement  of
                                   rights (including  the  availability  of
                                   injunctive relief[15])?

YES

We consider that the determination of the territorial scope of the right  of
making available will produce an evident effect on the enforcement  of  this
right, in order to avoid the need to take legal action  in  every  territory
in which the work is made accessible to recover  the  damage  caused  by  an
online infringement.


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.

                                   or a right holder:] Does the application

                                   environment  (e.g.  a  download)  create
                                   problems for you?

Linking and browsing

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[16]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[17] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                               11. Should  the  provision  of  a  hyperlink
                                   leading  to  a  work  or  other  subject
                                   matter protected under copyright, either
                                   in    general    or    under    specific
                                   circumstances,   be   subject   to   the
                                   authorisation of the rightholder?

YES, under specific circumstances

Hyperlinks are essential tools for online content delivery and form  a  part
of the communication process. Specifically, where a hyperlink  is  comprised
of or includes text protected as the whole or part of a copyright work  (see
The Newspaper Licensing Agency Ltd &  Ors  v  Meltwater  Holding  BV  &  Ors
[2011] EWCA Civ 890), the ‘provision’  of  a  hyperlink  would  involve  the
reproduction  of  the  whole  or  part  of  a  copyright   work.   In   such
circumstances, the authorisation of the rights-holder would be  appropriate.
This is especially  relevant  to  the  provision  of  paid-for  services  to
business  users,  which  would  otherwise  substitute  for  services   which
currently generate important income streams for content owners.

We understand the purpose  of  the  question  as  being  that  of  providing
relevant user access to copyright works. There are licensing  mechanisms  in
place to enable legal user access, so there is no reason to exempt  the  act
of hyperlinking to a  copyright  work  or  other  subject  matter  from  the
requirement of rightsholder authorisation. This view was also  held  by  the
District Court of The Hague  when  it  ruled  in  the  case  of  Buma/Stemra
against  the  operator  of  radio  streaming  websites  ‘Nederland.fm’   and
‘Op.fm’, that a website, which is  embedding  or  linking  to  radio-streams
without a licence, infringes copyright[18].

Nevertheless,  not  all  linking  should  necessarily  be  made  subject  to
authorisation. There might be an implied licence to link in a  loyal  manner
to other websites, as long as the material that is being linked to has  been
made available with the consent of the copyright holder.


                               12. Should the viewing of a  web-page  where
                                   this implies the temporary  reproduction
                                   of  a  work  or  other  subject   matter
                                   protected under copyright on the  screen
                                   and in the cache memory  of  the  user’s
                                   computer, either  in  general  or  under
                                   specific circumstances,  be  subject  to
                                   the authorisation of the rightholder?

YES, under specific circumstances

Reproductions that are both temporary  and  incidental  should  not  require
additional consent from the copyright holder. This does not  mean  that  all
“cache”  memory  copies  are  to  be  considered  “temporary”  or   strictly
“incidental” ones.

Technological development has had  the  effect  that  copyright  content  is
increasingly viewed or listened to (“streamed”)  through  computer  browsers
rather than by the making  of  downloaded  copies.  The  increasing  use  of
streaming is documented, for example, in a report  prepared  for  Ofcom[19],
which tracked digital behaviours and attitudes among persons  aged  12+,  in
the United Kingdom. The report noted that the incidence of streaming  of  TV
programmes was  much  more  common  than  downloading  (33%  for  streaming,
compared to 9% for downloading). Streaming services are one variety of  “on-
demand” service,  which  is  specifically  referred  to  in  Recital  10  to
Directive 2001/29/EC as requiring protection.

It would not be compatible with common sense  of  justice  that  essentially
the same act – making a copy of the monitoring report  for  the  purpose  of
reading its content – should  not  require  a  licence  in  one  case  (when
accessed online), while it does in the other (when accessed by  e-mail).  If
viewing and streaming were not subject to  rightholder  authorisation,  this
anomaly would exist in the online environment generally, where  the  problem
of piracy is notorious.

Accessing the same content by the easy alternative of visiting  the  website
of an unlicensed website (claiming to avoid the payment of  a  licence  fee)
obviously  conflicts  with  the  normal  exploitation  of  the   works   and
unreasonably prejudices the legitimate interests of the  copyright  holders,
thereby infringing the three-step test  in  international  conventions  that
the EU Member States are party to, as  well  as  Article  5(5)  of  European
Union Copyright Directive (EUCD). The computer user deliberately  creates  a
copy of the work on his computer screen. It is his very purpose  in  opening
his browser and going to a webpage for a book or article,  and/or  streaming
a sound recording or film. The end user must therefore be obliged to  obtain
a licence to access the underlying work. This does not prevent a  user  from
reading,  viewing  or  listening  to  content  that  has  been  made  legaly
available on the web with the consent of the copyright holder.  Any  further
use is, however, subject to authorisation or licensing.


Download to own digital content

Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[20].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[21].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
€ YES – Please explain by giving examples
€ NO
€ NO OPINION
  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.

Bearing in mind that a digital transmission requires the copy  of  the  work
and the reproduction right is involved in  such  transmission,  we  consider
that there is a need to be established that,  since  there  is  no  physical
storage to possess and the transferred file would be fixed  on  a  different
storage, the first sale doctrine (principle of exhaustion) doesn’t apply  to
digital files.
An important consequence of enabling the resale of digital content would  be
that the rightsholders couldn’t ensure or prevent that the reseller  doesn’t
retain the transferred file or transfer it to a  plurality  of  transferees.
Consequently, such an extension would be an invitation to infringement.

Moreover, since digital files are perfect  copies,  resellers  will  compete
with content retail industries forcing prices down.

Large scale digital retailers, Apple and Amazon, have both obtained  patents
for systems of resale for digital  items[22],  which  indicates  that  these
retailers may be thinking about setting up their own marketplace or  lending
library for the transfer of user-owned digital content.  These  marketplaces
should allow original content creators to benefit from the resale  of  their
goods and implement mechanisms to prevent people from making digital  copies
of  their  purchased  files  and  selling  those  again,  otherwise  reduced
earnings  prospects  could  seriously  reduce  the  creators’  incentive  to
create.

The ownership of digital files and  the  possibility  of  their  resale  are
linked  to  the  application  of  the  principle  of   exhaustion   to   the
distribution of tangible copies of works.  The  answer  provided  by  CJEU’s
case law in the Oracle vs. UsedSoft decision, Case C-128/11[23], is  limited
only to the specific case of software.

According to the German Regional Court of  Bielefeld,  the  CJEU’s  UsedSoft
decision is not applicable to the resale of other digital content.[24]  More
specifically, the German court held that,  because  of  the  nature  of  the
Software Directive 2009/24/EC as lex specialis to Directive 2001/29/EC,  the
reasoning in UsedSoft could not be applied to other subject-matter. In  this
vein, the Landgericht Bielefeld concluded that the EUCD does not permit  the
application of the principle of exhaustion to works in non-analogue form.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?

Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[25]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[26].
  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level  help  in  the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?

NO OPINION

  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

Under current international copyright legislation,  registration  cannot  be
made  compulsory  or  constitute  a  precondition  for  the  protection  and
exercise of rights. Possible advantages  of  registration,  provided  it  is
established on a voluntary basis, include the identification  and  proof  of
rights and the facilitation of copyright  licensing.  However,  authors  and
publishers cannot be required or expected to monitor  notifications  in  the
EU and its Member States.

  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[27], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[28]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[29]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[30] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.
  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?



Identifiers  are  crucial  for  the  efficiency  and  transparency  of   CMO
operations. EC-sponsored projects such  as  ARROW  and  ARROW  Plus  include
references to the desirability of using international  identifier  standards
such as ISNI (International Standard Name Identifier, ISO  27729)  and  ISTC
(International Standard text Code, ISO 21047).  This  could  be  facilitated
by the transposition of ISO 21047 and ISO 27729 into European standards.

EC support could also be given for  projects  to  populate  vital  databases
being  used  by  EU  Projects  with  agreed  international  standards.    In
particular the TEL (The European Library) database, used also for the  ARROW
project, could be funded to acquire ISNIs and ISTCs, for the free  use  also
by other databases, such as those of CMOs and Books in  Print.  There  is  a
need  for  CMOs  to  be  able  to  use  such  standards  to  optimise  their
distribution  activities,  as  required  under  the  EU  CRM  Directive.   A
feasibility study is desirable to see how the international  standards  ISNI
and ISTC can be interfaced with the  private  databases  of  the  CMOs,  for
instance, in the text and data field, so that distribution  of  revenue  can
be better automated. Such a study could be financed, totally  or  partially,
by the European Commission.


Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[31]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

YES

Whether the  environment  is  digital  or  analogue  is  irrelevant  to  the
question of term of protection and we  believe  that  the  current  term  of
copyright protection is appropriate.

  II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[32].

Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[33].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[34], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[35],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.


In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[36].

The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

           21.  Are  there  problems  arising  from  the  fact  that   most
               limitations and exceptions  provided  in  the  EU  copyright
               directives are optional for the Member States?

YES

           22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and,  if
               so, is there a need for a higher level of  harmonisation  of
               such exceptions?

YES

We are of the opinion that flexibility  is  important  to  ensure  that  the
copyright framework is fit to the  need  of  the  individual  Member  State.
Nevertheless, we consider that, in some  cases,  more  mandatory  exceptions
will minimize differences and eliminate  discrimination  among  citizens  of
the EU member states  (users  and  rightholders).  Harmonization  will  also
reinforce authors’ rights across European States and will  ensure  certainty
for users and beneficiaries of the exception.

Finally, as part of the copyright  incentive  scheme  we  advocate  for  the
implementation  of  harmonized  compensation  schemes  in  order  to   avoid
differences and discrimination among citizens of the EU.


           23. Should any new limitations and exceptions  be  added  to  or
               removed from  the  existing  catalogue?  Please  explain  by
               referring to specific cases.

Rather than considering whether to remove or add to the  current  exceptions
and limitations focus should be on the harmonization  and  clarification  of
the existing ones.

           24. Independently from the questions above, is there a  need  to
               provide for a  greater  degree  of  flexibility  in  the  EU
               regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

X NO

           25. If yes, what would be  the  best  approach  to  provide  for
               flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the
               ECJ, periodic revisions of the  directives,  interpretations
               by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of
               a fair-use or fair dealing provision  /  open  norm,  etc.)?
               Please  explain  indicating  what  would  be  the   relative
               advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well  as
               its possible effects on  the  functioning  of  the  Internal
               Market.
[Open question]

           26. Does the territoriality of limitations  and  exceptions,  in
               your experience, constitute a problem?

X YES



As stated above, we consider that the  harmonization  and  clarification  of
the  territorial  scope   of   certain   limitations   is   necessary.   The
territoriality of limitations and exceptions implies that  an  act  that  is
covered by an exception in one member state  may  not  be  covered  by  such
exception in another member state, also the same act can  be  subject  of  a
compensated limitation in one member state and subject of a  non-compensated
limitation  in  another  member  state.  Therefore,  a   higher   level   of
harmonization of limitations and exceptions is required.

In this regard, we need to mention  the  new  private  copying  compensation
system introduced in Spain where the amount of the compensation for  private
copying depends on some  pre-existing  amounts  allocated  in  the  National
Budget and not  on  the  actual  damage  caused  to  the  rightholders.  The
consequence of this new system is  that  Spanish  rightholders  and  foreign
rightholders in  Spain  do  not  receive  adequate  remuneration  for  their
creative activity while in  other  countries  an  adequate  compensation  is
recognized.


           27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at
               national level were to have cross-border effect, how  should
               the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when  such
               compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays  whom,
               where?)

 With respect to rights administered by RROs remuneration must  be  paid  by
the organism that signs the agreement with/is authorised  by  the  RRO,  and
the remuneration should be collected by the RRO granting  the  authorisation
or collecting the compensation. In cases of cross-border uses, the  question
of fair remuneration may raise difficult questions in this period of  public
deficits and, in particular, for the big linguistic areas.





Access to content in libraries and archives


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[37] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[38].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[39].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.


Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.
           32.  (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:]  Have
               you experienced specific problems when trying  to  negotiate

           33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

In  general,  problems  are  best  solved  through  stakeholder   dialogues.
Organisations representing  libraries,  archives,  authors,  publishers  and
CMOs have a proven track record in developing solutions  for  libraries  and
archives through stakeholder  dialogues.  Examples[40]  are  principles  for
rights clearance and registries of orphan works and  out-of-commerce  works;
model licensing agreements  for  the  making  available  of  out-of-commerce
works in closed and open networks; the Memorandum of  Understanding  on  Key
Principles on the  Digitization  and  Making  Available  of  Out-of-Commerce
Works  by  libraries;  and  the  development  and  deployment  of  ARROW  to
facilitate and reduce costs in rights information management[41].

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

           36.  (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you
               experienced  specific  problems  when  trying  to  negotiate
               agreements to enable  the  electronic  lending  (e-lending),
               including across borders, of books or other  materials  held
               in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?
(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

X NO
According to Spanish Intellectual Property Act the distribution right  shall
be construed as the making available to the public of  the  original  or  of
copies of the work, in a tangible support,  by  means  of  sale,  rental  or
lending or any other manner.

Therefore, e-lending in Spain is not  covered  by  law.  This  new  business
model should be based on licenses to deliver content between  the  libraries
and the rightholders or its representatives.

               do you see between libraries’ traditional activities such as
               on-premises consultation or public  lending  and  activities
               such as off-premises (online, at  a  distance)  consultation
               and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?

E-lending is a part of the publishers’ business model. As selling access  to
copyright works, rather than physical copies, is an essential  part  of  the
business model in the  digital  environment,  in  particular  in  trade-book
publishing, library e-lending will more  easily  conflict  with  the  normal
exploitation of the work and unreasonably prejudice the legitimate  interest
of the rightholder and could jeopardize the development of the digital  book
market.

E-lending can take place on the  basis  of  contractual  agreements  between
copyright holders or their representatives and libraries.

One should also note that the e-book market is only at a nascent stage,  and
that sales to consumers represent the majority of the trade-book market.



Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[42].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[43].

           40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or
               wanting to engage in mass  digitisation  projects,  a  right
               holder, a collective management organisation:] Would  it  be
               necessary in your country to  enact  legislation  to  ensure
               that the  results  of  the  2011  MoU  (i.e. the  agreements
               concluded between libraries and collecting  societies)  have
               a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be
               accessed across the EU?
           41. Would it be necessary to develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those
               already agreed for other types of content (e.g.  for  audio-
               or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[44]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.

           42. (a) [In particular if you are an  end  user/consumer  or  an
               institutional user:] Have you experienced specific  problems
               when  trying  to  use  works  or  other  subject-matter  for
               illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

X YES

The current concept of “illustration for teaching” in  Spanish  Intellectual
Property  Act  is  very  unclear  and  causes   several   uncertainties   to
rightholders and beneficiaries of the exception.

Sometimes, perhaps due to this reason, many  educational  institutions  have
claimed that “illustration  for  teaching”  includes  multiple  copying  and
other forms of uses which, in fact, need to be licensed, or made subject  to
remuneration. On this basis, they refuse to take up a licence.

FGEE finds it very difficult to convince teaching  institutions  to  sign  a
licence  for  the  uses  that  they  made  and  to  verify   compliance   of
intellectual property laws by such institutions.

In the second  half  of  2013  Spanish  courts  ruled  against  two  Spanish
universities, ordering them to take  up  a  licence  with  FGEE  and  remove
copies that they had made  of  copyright-protected  material.  However,  the
illustration for teaching was not invoked by the defendants in view  of  the
fact that current exception in Spain only covers face-to-face  teaching  not
digital copies an online education.

We understand the exception in Article 5(3)(a) as being a  narrow  exception
to the exclusive rights,  aimed  at  enabling  exactly  what  it  reads:  to
illustrate; which is far  from  being  the  same  as  planned  producing  of
teaching  material.  The   underlying   rationale   for   the   concept   of
“illustration for teaching” is to cover minor acts of copying that does  not
conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and  does  not  unreasonably
prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholders.  This  understanding
of the concept is in accordance with its wording as well as of the  opinions
expressed by the foremost experts  on  it.  Teaching  material  in  whatever
format, including multiple copying for classroom  use,  cannot  and  is  not
destined to be made under this exception, as it would  definitely  undermine
the normal exploitation of these works.

Nevertheless, the Spanish current exception is going to be amended, since  a
draft bill on the partial reform of the Intellectual Property Act is in  the
process of being adopted.  The  new  text  doesn’t  solve  the  problem  and
establishes  a  tricky  limit  in  which  the  payment   of   an   equitable
remuneration and the volume that can be reproduced depends on  the  type  of
work and the type of educational institution and the use of the copy.

           43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Clarification on both Community and national levels that  “illustration  for
teaching”  does  not  comprise  the  reproduction,  making   available   and
distribution of copyrighted works, such as in the form of arranged,  planned
or structured multiple copies for classroom  use,  compilations,  e-reserves
and the sort would be appropriate.  Such  access  to  works  is  offered  by
authors and publishers directly, or through rights  administration  by  RROs
and other CMOs.

The exception should cover  all  kinds  of  books,  journals  and  magazines
without distinction  even  though  certain  categories  of  works  could  be
excluded, and be subject  of  an  equitable  remuneration  for  authors  and
publishers. Moreover, a supervisory power should be conferred  to  the  CMOs
in order  to  verify  compliance  with  the  license  terms  by  educational
institutions  and  if  the  uses  of  copyrighted  material  made  by   such
institutions are really covered by the exception.

           44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate  the
               use of content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How
               successful are they?


Most of the publishers are currently developing  innovative  offers  in  the
field of educational publishing to now include digital uses  of  educational
material  for  example  for  white  boards.  Educational  publications   are
nowadays coming together with versatile and flexible  mechanism,  which  are
also possibly  accessible  cross-border.  Educational  publishers  are  also
increasingly licencing modules and part of books,  rather  than  the  entire
book. It is in the interest for them to tailor their offer on new  needs  of
their users.


ADD: WIZWIZ in France, Knooppunt in  Flanders,  In  several  countries,  the
exception  for  illustration  for  teaching  is  actually   served   through
collective licence managed by a RRO which remunerate rightsholders  for  the
use of their material in class.


We are aware that there is an  issue  for  distance  learning  and  what  is
referred to as VLE (Virtually learning  environment).  If  the  material  is
accessible under an exception, it  can  cause  issue  to  be  accessed  from
across borders, whereas it is not if accessed under a licence and  within  a
closed network. French publishers are asking to have  compulsory  management
with remuneration  for  the  works  covered  by  the  educational  exception
(digital uses). However, funding seems to  be  missing  to  remunerate  this
exception.


We ought to remind on this point that educational  publishing  represents  a
large part of the trade book publishing  market  (about  50%)  which  cannot
afford  to  be  put  at  risk  by  a  broad  exception.uropean   educational
publishing is a guarantee of freedom of expression and plurality of views.


           45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed,  what
               would  be  its  main  elements?  Which  activities  of   the
               beneficiary institutions should be covered  and  under  what
               conditions?

As we mentioned in questions 42 and 43  the  main  elements,  among  others,
needed in the exception of “illustration for teaching” are:

-The uses should be limited to non relevant excerpts.
-The exception should apply to all kinds of books, magazines  and  journals,
even though some kind of works could be excluded.
-Limited to both university and pre-university levels.
-A supervisory power should be conferred to the CMOs.
-An equitable remuneration should be paid to authors and publishers.

46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

The preferred option is to encourage solutions and to  protect  market-based
offers by ensuring that: any limitation  for  the  benefit  of  teaching  is
limited to small parts; copies made  under  the  limitation  remain  in  the
hands of the teacher; rightholders are named and receive fair  remuneration;
certain  categories  of  works  can  be  excluded  from  the  limitation  or
exception;  educational  material  is  promoted  as  crucial  to   a   sound
education,   providing   cultural   vitality   and   economic    prosperity;
interoperability is an important  criterion  when  providing  for  e-reading
possibilities and/or e-reading material in education.

The EC’s and EU Member  State’s  support,  as  required  by  national  legal
traditions and requirements, to individual and collective rights  management
schemes would be appropriate  and  welcome.  Entering  into  individual  and
collective  licensing  schemes  offered  to  educational  establishments  by
rightholders and RROs is what provides the broadest and most adequate  legal
access to intellectual property to the teaching  and  research  communities.
In a fast changing world, where  technologies  move  with  an  unprecedented
speed,  regulations  do  not  have  the  ability  to  offer   the   required
flexibility. Licensing agreements do. They offer  comprehensive  tailor-made
solutions to access scientific and literary  works  to  meet  the  needs  of
educational institutions.  This  is  the  safest,  simplest,  fastest,  most
innovative, most convenient and most cost efficient way to  seamless  access
to high quality teaching material  from  multiple  authors  and  publishers.
What’s  more,  flourishing  local  cultural   industries   and   a   healthy
educational  system  with  broad  access  to  local  resources   contributes
significantly to the nation’s economy and employment.



Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[45]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

           46. (a) [In particular if you are an  end  user/consumer  or  an
               institutional user:] Have you experienced specific  problems
               when trying to use works or  other  subject  matter  in  the
               context of research  projects/activities,  including  across
               borders?
(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

X NO

Even though, we have not experienced problems  resulting  from  the  way  in
which works are used in the context  of  research  activities,  the  Spanish
Intellectual Property Act includes a wide  exception  that  stipulates  that
the author’s license shall not be required for the communication of  a  work
or making available to specific persons for research purposes  when  carried
out  through  a  closed  an  internal  network  via  specialized   terminals
installed for such purposes on the  premises  of  certain  institutions  and
provided such works appear in the institutions own collection  and  are  not
the object of licensing and purchase conditions.

           47. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

An equitable remuneration should be  paid  and  the  acts  covered  by  such
exception should be clarified.

           48. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the
               use of content for research  purposes?  How  successful  are
               they?

The use of copyright material for research purposes  is  commonly  comprised
in the licences offered by publishers. Training opportunities  for  teachers
and professors regarding the inclusion of digital content  in  the  national
curriculum,  in  addition  to  support  for  public  funding  for   academic
libraries, could be further promoted.




Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [47].
The Marrakesh Treaty[48] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

           49. (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability  or
               an organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]
               Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
               including  across  borders,  arising  from  Member   States’
               implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?
(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?

X NO

           50. If there  are  problems,  what  could  be  done  to  improve
               accessibility?

Even  though,  we   have   not   experienced   problems   related   to   the
exception/limitation  for  the  benefit  of  people  with  a disability,  we
consider  that  the  cross-border  exchange  of  accessible  format   copies
permitted under article 5 (1) of Marrakech Treaty could involve  a  risk  to
rightholders who will have to bear  the  first  access  of  their  works  in
certain territories where they haven’t introduce their works.  In  the  case
of Spanish written books the likelihood  of  loosing  the  control  over  it
destination is higher, since the dissemination  of  Spanish  language  could
increase  the  number  of  exchanges  in  the  whole   of   Spanish-speaking
countries.

           51. What mechanisms exist in  the  market  place  to  facilitate
               accessibility to content? How successful are they?

Publishers are increasingly publishing books in the e-Pub format, which  can
be directly converted  into  files  accessible  to  persons  who  are  print
disabled.[49] Those files can be sold to users directly or  to  institutions
serving the community of the print disabled.



Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[50] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).
Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[51].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

           52. (a) [In particular if you are an  end  user/consumer  or  an
               institutional user:] Have you experienced obstacles,  linked
               to copyright,  when  trying  to  use  text  or  data  mining
               methods, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services  based  on  text  or
data mining methods, including across borders?
(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

X NO

There are no  impediments  to  Text  and  Data  Mining  (TDM).  Authors  and
publishers are not blocking  access  for  TDM.  Rather,  they  are  offering
solutions, and, to this end, for instance, the International Association  of
Scientific, Technical and Medical publishers (STM) has  issued  a  statement
and a sample  licence[52].  Through  this  statement,  signatory  publishers
commit to granting the necessary copyright licences to permit the  text  and
data  mining  of  copyright-protected  works  and  other  subject-matter  on
reasonable terms for non-commercial scientific research purposes in the  EU.
They  will  work  with  rights  clearance  agents  as  necessary,  implement
licensing systems to facilitate  easy  “one-to-many”  rights  clearance  and
platforms, and continue  to  develop  relevant  technological  solutions  to
facilitate the access in an efficient way.

Licensing solutions exist  both  for  commercial  and  non-commercial  uses,
offered by copyright holders directly, or via collective rights  management.


           53. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

           54. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed,  what
               would be its  main  elements?  Which  activities  should  be
               covered and under what conditions?

There are problems linked to Text and Data Mining (TDM)  from  the  side  of
the copyright holders and their representatives. The main ones are the  need
for clear and agreed definitions of text mining and data  mining;  right  of
the copyright holder  to  control  access  to  their  databases;  protection
against unfair competition linked to commercial  exploitation  of  text  and
data mining; and the lack  of  constructive  dialogue  with  some  key  user
groups, in particular those  who  walked  out  of  the  European  Commission
Licences for Europe stakeholder dialogue initiative. The  preferred  way  to
solve this is to clarify that there will be no exception for TDM.

           55. If your view is that a different solution  is  needed,  what
               would it be?
           56.  Are  there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that
               constitute barriers to  the  use  of  text  or  data  mining
               methods?


User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[53]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[54].

           57. (a) [In particular if you are an  end  user/consumer:]  Have
               you experienced problems when  trying  to  use  pre-existing
               works or other subject matter to disseminate new content  on
               the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?

X YES

New technologies  have  encouraged  the  re-use  of  pre-existing  protected
material  in  the  creation  of  new  material   uploaded,   including   the
modification of that material or the addition  of  it  to  a  new  piece  of
content (pictures, poems, articles in blogs or websites).

It is very difficult to detect such re-uses in new works  and  therefore  to
claim remuneration for it.

           62. If your view is that a different solution  is  needed,  what
               would it be?


-Solutions for the identification of rightholders,  their  agents  or  other
representatives (such as CMOs) from whom permission can be sought;

-Solutions  to  give  users  information  about  licensing   and   licensing
conditions: how the licensing process works and what users  can  do  with  a
work under a chosen licence;

-Streamlined  one-click/click  through/accessible   and   easy   pay-per-use
transactional systems that make the licensing process quicker and easier.




 III. Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[55]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[56][57].
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

           63. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the
               scope and application of the private copying and reprography
               exceptions[58] in the digital environment?

X YES

There is a need for  clarification  that,  in  respect  of  text  and  image
levies,  “rightholders”  eligible  for  “fair  compensation”  comprise  both
authors and publishers.

Since  divergent   national   systems   could   involve   inequality   among
rightholders of different countries,  we  consider  that  clarification  and
harmonization is needed.

Moreover,  it  is  also  needed  a  European  framework  guaranteeing   that
rightholders obtain an equitable remuneration.

In the digital environment, copies made  via  web  sites,  intranets,  cloud
services… could be included in the  private  copying  exception  if  certain
conditions  are  fulfilled.  In  that  case,  rightholders   should   obtain
remuneration for those copies. Applying the  private  copying  exception  to
copies made via web sites, intranets, and cloud  services  could  mean  that
those copies would be taken into account by usage studies which  assess  the
harm caused.

           64. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes
               in the context  of  a service  that  has  been  licensed  by
               rightholders, and where  the  harm  to  the  rightholder  is
               minimal, be subject to private copying levies?


The CJEU decided in the VG Wort case (C-457/11 to C-460/11) that a  possible
consent by the copyright  holder  to  the  copying  of  his  work  or  other
protected material in the context of the exceptions or limitations  provided
for in EUCD Article 5.2 and 5.3 has no effect on fair  remuneration  payable
under the exception. This means that remuneration  paid  to  the  author  or
publisher under  a  licence  does  not  preclude  from  receiving  the  fair
compensation for the exception or limitation. Such copies may  therefore  be
covered by the levies

           65. How would changes in levies with respect to the  application
               to online services (e.g. services based on  cloud  computing
               allowing, for instance, users to have  copies  on  different
               devices) impact  the  development  and  functioning  of  new
               business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on
               the other?

Where authors and publishers are remunerated for certain uses on  the  basis
of copyright levies, the device and  storage  medium  remuneration  is  also
payable if protected works are copied in  connection  with  online  services
(e.g. cloud computing).  That  is,  for  example,  the  case  if  works  are
downloaded from a cloud portal and stored on a PC or storage medium.

           66.  Would you see an added value in making  levies  visible  on
               the invoices for products subject to levies?[59]

X YES

We  must  point  out  that  on  30th  December  2011  the  private   copying
compensation system  was  overhauled  in  Spain.  From  that  date  onwards,
manufacturers, importers or distributors of reproduction equipment,  devices
or appliances do not  pay  any  compensation  for  private  copying  to  the
collective management societies as a result  of  marketing  them  in  Spain.
That compensation was replaced by a  payment  of  5million  euros  from  the
National Budget.

Moreover,  the  Royal  Decree  1657/2012,  of  7  December  regulating   the
procedure for the payment of fair compensation  for  private  copying  under
the National Budget does not base the  amount  to  be  paid  on  the  actual
economic  damage  caused  by  the  establishment  of  the  private   copying
exception.

As this amount was greatly reduced and the  same  can  be  considered  as  a
merely symbolic amount, FGEE filed a complaint before the EU Commission  and
filed  an  appeal  against   the   Royal   Decree   1657/2012   before   the
Administrative Division of the Supreme  Court.  Both  procedures  are  still
pending.

Nevertheless, for reasons of transparency we have always argued in favor  of
making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies.

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[60].

           67. Have  you  experienced  a  situation  where  a  cross-border
               transaction resulted in undue levy  payments,  or  duplicate
               payments of the same levy, or other obstacles  to  the  free
               movement of goods or services?

           68. What percentage of products subject to a  levy  is  sold  to
               persons other than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly
               unrelated to private copying? Do any of  those  transactions
               result in undue  payments?  Please  explain  in  detail  the
               example you provide (type of products, type of  transaction,
               stakeholders, etc.).

In  respect  of  text  and  image  (reprography)  levies,  the  question  is
irrelevant, as noted also in  the  report  from  the  EC-appointed  mediator
António Vitorino. Unlike the scope of the private  copying  exception  under
EUCD Article  5.2(b),  which  is  limited  to  reproductions  that  serve  a
specific purpose ("for private use") regardless of the type  of  device  and
method,  the  reprography  exception  under  EUCD  Article   5.2(a)   covers
reproductions on a specific medium (paper), using a  specific  method  ("any
kind of photographic technique"), regardless of its purpose,  which  may  be
for professional, educational, private and other uses.  This means that  the
reprography levies cover both private and professional uses.

Consequently, when it comes to analyzing the impact of  reprography  levies,
it is not relevant to make a distinction between  private  and  professional
uses, since both of them are subject to the payment of a levy. Against  this
background, it is also unnecessary to distinguish between sales  of  devices
in the private and business sectors. The point is that copies are  permitted
by law in both the private and business spheres. The – unified – device  and
storage medium remuneration can therefore be justified  both  for  sales  to
private persons and sales to business end users.

Moreover, surveys show that personal copying of  copyrighted  works  at  the
workplace is a common practice.

           69. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do
               they affect? To what extent could a priori exemptions and/or
               ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States
               help to remedy the situation?

           70. If you have identified specific problems  with  the  current
               functioning of the levy system,  how  would  these  problems
               best be solved?

In  Spain,  as  we  have  mentioned  before  the  copying  levy  system  was
overhauled and was replaced by a payment charged to the National Budget.

The EU could contribute to clarification through  sensitizing  EC  officials
and EU policy makers and institutions that text and image (reprography)  and
private levies are different, and ensure consistency in their  dealing  with
the two different levy schemes.

Also it should be considered to what extent the handling of cases of  export
could be facilitated by a central European agency, and  the  obligation  for
exporters to pay  the  levy  according  to  the  rules  of  the  country  of
destination should be regulated.


  IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[61] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[62]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

           71. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is  the
               best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that
               you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of
               your works and performances?

For secondary uses administered by RROs, fair compensation  is  ensured  via
the  RROs’  distribution  rules   and   the   requirement   of   appropriate
representation  by  both  authors  and  publishers  on  its  decision-making
bodies. Nevertheless, equitable compensations are needed to compensate  uses
made without the control and authorisation of rightholders.


           72. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to
               prohibit certain clauses in contracts)?

X NO OPINION

           73. If you consider that the current rules  are  not  effective,
               what would you  suggest  to  address  the  shortcomings  you
               identify?
[Open question]

   V. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE[63] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[64].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[65]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[66].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

           74. Should the civil enforcement system in the  EU  be  rendered
               more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with
               a commercial purpose?

X YES

Wider legal access  to  works  can  only  be  achieved  through  appropriate
mechanisms which include direct licensing  by  authors  and  publishers  and
collective  management  of  rights,  combined  with  financial   incentives,
protection  against  infringement  and  copyright   enforcement,   including
efficient combating of piracy and other forms of unauthorized  reproduction,
including  online  infringements.  RROs  play  an  indispensable   role   in
assisting authors and publishers to  enable  wider  legal  access  to  their
works and in awareness raising and enforcement of rights.

           75. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear  enough
               to allow for  sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such
               as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,  payment
               service  providers,  domain  name   registrars,   etc.)   in
               inhibiting online copyright infringements with a  commercial
               purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the
               cooperation of intermediaries?

Collaboration with Internet Service Providers (ISPs)  to  address  copyright
infringement  and  enforcement  issues  is  welcome.  The  Commission  could
facilitate initiatives in this respect through  financial  contributions  to
awareness-raising campaigns. The use of filtering technologies by  ISPs  and
others as well as systems to  inform  about  authorised  use  (e.g.  through
search engines  using  the  ACAP[67])  are  highly  welcome  and  should  be
encouraged. These are mechanisms which help in enforcing  contractual  terms
and preventing  the  networks  from  being  used  to  infringe  intellectual
property.

The Commission should also encourage the investment in new business  models.
The establishment of a sustainable  legal  offer,  reflecting  the  cultural
diversity of the  European  written  sector,  can  only  take  place  in  an
environment ensuring the full respect of copyright  and,  therefore,  the  –
financial – independence of creators. Against this  background,  we  request
that the Commission maintains a  stable  and  predictable  legal  framework,
promoting its rationale and its enforcement by all players.


           76. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the
               right balance is achieved between the right  to  have  one’s
               copyright respected and other rights such as the  protection
               of private life and protection of personal data?

X NO

The balance of protection of copyright with other fundamental  rights,  such
as privacy and protection of personal data, needs to be found on  the  basis
of the principle of proportionality, in  the  discretion  of  Member  States
(see the cases Productores de Música de España (Promusicae) v Telefónica  de
España  SAU  (C-275/06[68])  and  LSG-Gesellschaft   zur   Wahrnehmung   von
Leistungsschutzrechten GmbH v Tele2 Telecommunication GmbH  (C-557/07[69])).
However,  recent  cases  in  Spain  show  that   service   providers   don’t
collaborate in the identification of infringers. Consequently,  rightholders
need to be able to identify the owner of an infringing website or a  service
provider client that is using the web to share or upload  copyrighted  works
without authorization.

  VI. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

           77. Should the EU  pursue  the  establishment  of  a  single  EU
               Copyright Title, as a means  of  establishing  a  consistent
               framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across  the
               EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

X NO OPINION


Work on a single EU Copyright Title would require substantial resources  and
unnecessarily distract focus from the important work on  an  overall  EU  IP
strategy. Also, it is difficult to see how it could be  established  on  the
basis of Article 118 of the Lisbon Treaty (TFEU).  Nevertheless,  we  insist
on the need of  a  higher  degree  of  harmonization  in  order  to  prevent
differences among rightholders from different member states  and  to  ensure
certainty for users.

           78. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright
               in the EU? Does the current level of  difference  among  the
               Member State legislation mean that this  is  a  longer  term
               project?

 VII. Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

           79. Are there any other important  matters  related  to  the  EU
               legal framework for copyright? Please explain  and  indicate
               how such matters should be addressed.

We suggest that the creation of a specialized panel of  judges,  responsible
for copyright legal matters, is created at the CJEU. More and more cases  on
copyright  issues  are  decided  by  the  CJEU.  This  requires   a   stable
institution with copyright experts.

of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

[25] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[26] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[27] E.g. the International  Standard  Recording  Code  (ISRC)  is  used  to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number (ISBN)  is  used
to identify books.

Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii)  Article  5(1)  in
the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
[36] Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive  (a
mandatory exception to copyright and related rights in the  case  where  the
rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has  been  given  a  cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary  work  –  for
instance a novel – is considered an orphan work  in  a  Member  State,  that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States  and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.

[43] France and  Germany  have  already  adopted  legislation  to  back  the
effects of the MoU. The French  act  (LOI  n°  2012-287  du  1er  mars  2012
relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe  siècle)
foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher  in  question
opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption  of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are  not  members
of the collecting society.

one's own video to a pre-existing sound  recording),  or  adding  one's  own
text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are  “mash-ups”  (blending
two sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic  work  (report,
review etc.) in a blog.
