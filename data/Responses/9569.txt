Introduction
Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content  -  for information, education or entertainment purposes  -  regardless of geographical borders. 
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative framework with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now. The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact that two groups  -  user-generated content and text and data mining  -  did not reach consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.: "territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council Conclusions "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy", the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" and "Content Online". These consultations provided valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders' remuneration, particularly in the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

About AKM
AKM is the collective management organisation of composers, lyricists and music publishers in Austria. AKM collects and distributes royalties for musical authors and music publishers when their music is played in concerts and other live-events, is used as background music in cafés, restaurants, hotels, shopping centres, boutiques, etc., is broadcast by radio- and tv-stations or is made available on the internet by music-on-demand services, streaming services, etc. 
AKM will thus answer, when applicable and appropriate, in its capacity as 1) representative of authors and composers, 2) representatives of music publishers and 3) representative of collective management organisations (CMOs). 
It is important to stress here, as it is underlined in the new directive on CMOs, that authors societies `are owned or controlled by its members' (the right holders), `are organised on a not-for-profit basis' and act `for the collective benefit of rightholders'. Therefore the interests of CMOs are not different than those of the authors and composers, as CMOs are formed and governed by them and work on their own interests. 

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
* Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?  
* [The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights  -  e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law. 
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet  -  e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online e-book seller  -  therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights Management should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-territorial licences in musical works for online services; the structured stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the "same" service is available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can only access their "national" service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence). 
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So far AKM has been asked once every two years by an online music service provider (MSP) to grant a multi-territory license. More MSPs have been interested in a license for their music online service covering the Territory of Austria. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above  -  what would be the best way to tackle them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The outcome of the stakeholder dialog "License for Europe" is that authors' rights do not constitute any problems as regards cross-border availability and portability of online music services. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The new CRM Directive aims at promoting cross-border licensing. Therefore, it would be premature to envisage any initiative before its implementation. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Collective management and voluntary aggregation of rights at authors' societies is the most effective way to address the rights' clearance for music online services across the EU.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reason why certain online music services are not available in all EU Member States lies  -  in almost all cases  -  in the business choice of the online music service provider (MSP). This choice is based on the diversity of EU culture and EU markets. Authors' rights do not constitute a problem here, notably since collective management societies (CMS) are obliged to address all licensing requests. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was also shown in the stakeholder dialog "License for Europe. The result of the "License for Europe" initiative is that the problems that have been identified as preventing cross-border availability and portability of online services are not related to authors' rights. This is why a prolongation of the discussion was considered not necessary by the EU Commission. The main issues that lead the commercial users to limit their services to a certain territory are:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Business choices for commercial users based on language, local marketing strategies focused on local interests, local advertising market, investment/return balance, etc. aspects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The applicable tax regime, including high VAT rates for digital content, which is probably the most burdensome layer of complexity for commercial users, including high VAT rates for digital content
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Problems related to cross-border internet/broadband connection and roaming when abroad
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Lack of efficient cross-border electronic payment structures, especially for young people combined with a lack of consumer trust in cross-border e-commerce. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally, high levels of piracy and unauthorised use of protected works discourage new players to invest in the market, as they find it difficult to recoup their investment when competing with wide availability of completely free unauthorised uses. Therefore, the above-mentioned issues should be addressed as a priority to encourage businesses to offer cross-border availability and portability of online services.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Furthermore, the Directive on collective management of copyright and multi-territorial licensing of online music (CRM Directive), which has been adopted by the Council of the EU on 20[th] February 2014, aims at facilitating multi-territorial and multi-repertoire licensing of author's rights in musical works for online uses in the EU/EEA. The Directive sets a legal framework that accompanies the development of the online market for the cross-border use of music and the solutions already provided by CMSs to organise rights clearance. Therefore, for the sake of efficiency, no new initiative should be taken before the first report on the implementation of the CRM Directive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As representative of rightholders, AKM aims at licensing as many online music services as possible. Collective management is the most efficient way to ensure the widest possible availability of as many repertoires as possible in the easiest way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by giving examples
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.............................................................................................................
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.............................................................................................................
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The continuous development of the online market and the stakeholder dialog "Licences for Europe" show that there is no need for a legislative change to increase the cross-border availability of online music services. Further reasons for that are, as stated in AKM's answer to question 4, that authors' rights are not an obstacle to the growth of online music services as well as their cross-border availability and that the CRM Directive aims at promoting cross-border licensing.
Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
* [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of software and databases.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.  
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the making of copies, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission  -  e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available  -  and at the users' end  -  e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.
The act of "making available" 
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of "making available" takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) suggests that a relevant criterion is the "targeting" of a certain Member State's public. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are "targeted" by the online service provider. A service provider "targets" a group of customers residing in a specific country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations  -  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  -  sufficiently clear? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  The scope of the making available right in cross-border situations is sufficiently clear.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  The "country of origin" approach is certainly not acceptable for rightholders, because it is fundamentally detrimental to them, notably as it encourages "forum shopping".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scope of the making available right:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As to the question of what is covered by the making available right, Article 3 Para 1 Info-Soc Directive and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) clarify that there are two cumulative elements required for the applicability of the making available right: i) the act of communication of a protected work and ii) the public that is addressed by that act of communication.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ECJ recently stated:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"It is thus apparent from that provision [Article 3(1) Directive 2001/29] that the concept of communication to the public includes two cumulative criteria, namely, an `act of communication' of a work and the communication of that work to a `public'. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[...] As is apparent from Article 3(1) Directive 2001/29, for there to be an `act of communication' is sufficient, in particular, that a work is made available to a public in such a way that the persons forming that public may access it, irrespective of whether they avail themselves of that opportunity" (ECJ Decision of 13th February 2014, Case C-466/12, Para 16, 19).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore, the act of uploading can be qualified as an "act of communication" in the sense that it affords the user of a website an access to the works that it contains. The availability to the public is an additional criterion for the application of the right of making available and such right is therefore implemented where such availability occurs, i.e. where the different potential users of the concerned website are situated. Thus, it is also clarified, where the act of `making available' takes place.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Country of origin" approach:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "country of origin" approach  -  which would localise the act of making available in one single Member State  -  is not an adequate means to localise the making available right. Concerns in this regard are raised as well in the study commissioned by the EU Commission to DeWolf & Partner ("DeWolf-Study")!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main danger of the "country of origin" approach is that it encourages "forum shopping": a service provider can choose the country where it will benefit from the most favorable conditions to exploit a work. Whatever criterion would be defined: i) where the act of the upload takes place (location of the server) or ii) the country where the uploader is established (location of the economic residence, location of the person uploading), such location can very easily be changed. The criterion is also deceptively simple and does not suffice with regard to companies with a complex and diversified structure and/or operations, e.g. if several servers are used in different countries. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Such criterion is therefore totally unsatisfactory  -  please also note that copyright was excluded from the general principle of the country of origin in the E-commerce directive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As for determining the making available right by taking into account the targeted public, this does not reflect the reality of the exploitation. Thus, it does not take into account the persons who access the works if they are not targeted. Right holders would be prevented from exercising their rights on the basis of a subjective criterion: the presumed intent of the service provider. The difficulty of implementation of such criterion must also be underlined: does a website in German target Germany? Switzerland? Austria?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The territorial scope of the making available right is sufficiently clear. The "making available" takes place, if there is an `act of communication' of a work and the communication of that work is directed to a `public' in such a way that the persons forming that public may access it, irrespective of whether they avail themselves of that opportunity. This has been clarified by the EJC (recently: Case C-466/12) and results from Article 3 (1) Info-Soc Directive (please refer to AKM's answer in question 8 above).
Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation 
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different persons/entities. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The licensing of two different rights for a certain type of exploitation has never created any problem in the past. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Linking and browsing 
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are pending before the CJEU in which the question has been raised whether the provision of a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder. 
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This question has been recently answered by the ECJ in its Decision of 13[th] February 2014, Case C-466/12, Svensson etc vs Retriever Sverige AB. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ECJ ruled that "the provision on a website of clickable links (in the sense of a reference in eg HTML, which functionally provides access to another part of the same or to another electronic document on the internet) to works freely available on another website does not constitute an `act of communication to the public' as referred to in Article 3 (1) Info-Soc Directive."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In his reasoning the ECJ recalled the two cumulative criteria for the application of the concept of communication to the public: "an `act of communication of a work and the communication of that work to a `public' (Para 16)". The ECJ specified further that to be covered by the concept of `communication to the public' a communication must be directed to a `new public' "that was not taken into account by the copyright holders when they authorised the initial communication to the public (Para 24)". 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nevertheless, the ECJ took care to specify that the authorisation of the right holders remains necessary where the link enables access to a public "which was not taken account by the copyright holders when they authorized the initial communication" (Para 31), which then constitutes a new public compared to that initially taken into account by the right holders.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus, the right holders retain the possibility to take measures restricting to a determined public access to a website, in which case any link enabling a larger public to access the content of such website must be authorized by them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It also follows from the decision that links to infringing content, and to sites whose terms and conditions prohibit or place restrictions on linking, as well as to sites behind paywalls or with technological protection schemes constitute an act of communication to the public according to Article 3 (1) Info-Soc Directive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user's computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The jurisprudence of the ECJ (notably, but not exclusively the rulings: Infopaq I + II, Cases C-5/08 and C-302/10 - in which the ECJ clarified the requirements of Article 5 (1) Info-Soc Directive) already provides answers which strike a balance between the different interests at stake and offers the market a solution that enables it to develop while safeguarding the rightholders' interests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recital 33 of the Info-Soc Directive provides some relevant elements on `browsing' after it first explains the conditions of the Art 5.1 exception: "(...) To the extent that they meet these conditions, this exception should include acts which enable browsing as well as acts of caching to take place, including those which enable transmission systems to function efficiently, provided that the intermediary does not modify the information and does not interfere with the lawful use of technology, widely recognised and used by industry, to obtain data on the use of the information. A use should be considered lawful where it is authorised by the rightholder or not restricted by law." 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It can be concluded that when those conditions are not met, for instance when a) the reproduction on a web-page is not only an integral and essential part of a technological process but the intermediary interferes with the use of technology in order to specifically make the protected content available to the end-user according to the data obtained from the user, or b) the sole purpose of it is not to allow a lawful use of the work but e.g. to enable an unauthorised making available, or c) when such reproduction has an independent commercial value because of the display of protected works on the website (visual arts, literary works, etc.) against the will of their rightholders, then the Art 5.1 of InfoSoc Directive would not apply.
Download to own digital content 
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article). The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy). This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have "re-sold" it  -  this is often referred to as the "forward and delete" question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

[In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The consequence of enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content would be significant harm to authors, publishers and to online services in terms of the impact on supply and value in the market, since the resold file would be identical to the original and prices for the original files would be driven down inexorably. As a consequence the market prices would be eliminated by second-hand markets.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Allowing free circulation of creative content in the single market upon its first sale would practically legalise all those uses on the Internet (as being a further distribution) which has been called piracy so far  -  like the circulation through certain P2P networks and BitTorrent platforms. Furthermore, even if a second-hand market emerges, determination of the legality of the copies, in a situation where already millions of illicit copies are circulating, would be extremely difficult and giving the holders of illicit copies the right to sell them would be rewarding piracy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. A legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content would be inconsistent with existing EU law, since it is very clearly regulated in Art 3(3) of the Info-Soc Directive that exhaustion does not occur in the case of the making available right and in Recital 29 of the Info-Soc Directive that the question of exhaustion does not arise in the case of services and online services in particular. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. The recent jurisprudence of the ECJ (Oracle vs UsedSoft, C-128/11) is in line with that, since the ECJ limited the applicability of its decision exactly to the scope in which the Software Directive applies and emphasised the difference in the wording of the respective exhaustion regulations in the Software Directive and the Info-Soc Directive.
Registration of works and other subject matter  -  is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being considered.  
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of works and other subject matter? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What would be the possible advantages of such a system? 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system? 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open questions]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answers to questions 16, 17 and 18 can be summarised as follows: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Collective management societies (CMS) are already maintaining voluntary registration databases, which are a source of comprehensive rights' information. CMS are constantly working on keeping the collected data up-to-date and addressing the evolving needs of the market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The creation of a registration system at EU level in addition to the CMS' databases has no benefit for the rightholders, if a static registry is established solely collecting the name of a work and its first owner. To be effective and functional for licensing a database needs to be dynamic and interoperable with the other metadata databases, reporting and dispute resolution processes used by the industry sector. This issue can be best dealt by the operating industry.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. The danger of a voluntary registration system at EU level in addition to the CMS' databases is that only major rightholders would provide for such parallel registration due to reasons of costs and organisation structure for further monitoring, which would be detrimental for smaller rightholders and which would lead to legal uncertainty.
How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers, collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed `identifiers'. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are specific to the sector in which they have been developed, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database should, once operational, provide a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition was established to develop building blocks for the expression and management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM)  -  a comprehensive data model for all types of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub is seeking to take such identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across different sectors. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AKM is working hard to implement the state of the art technologies and databases to deliver the best management solutions for its members.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Common industry standards have been developed over decades (ISWC, DOI, ISRC, ISBN, IPI, etc). Particularly for online exploitation of music, some standard formats for identifiers and data exchange are already in place resulting from voluntary industry initiatives and are used by societies, rightholders and music service providers. E.g. the DDEX format (Digital Data Exchange) has been developed and continuously adapted to meet the digital business needs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Such common standards require investment and ongoing costs to maintain. But more important than that such common standards need to be actively adopted and used by all participants. A clear commitment from producers, broadcasters and users of rights to use such standards is crucial for facilitating the handling of data and for ensuring good data quality.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Support of the EU Commission could be provided by welcoming and funding new initiatives for such common standards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Term of protection  -  is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US). 

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of protection. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Only service providers whose profit results from the exploitation of copyright protected works without contributing to creating new works would benefit from the shortening of the term of protection. Obviously, there is no benefit for the rightholders.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  In a large part of the world the protection period of 70 years after the author's death is established and only recently EU policy makers decided in keeping this period and even extending it for the protection of sound recordings. There is no qualified reason to deviate from this strategy at this point.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  The shortening of the term of protection would have a significant impact on EU economy, since copyright-intensive industries contribute 4.2% of EU's GDP according the a recent study of OHIM.
Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market 
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC. 
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international law. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders. 
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level), these limitations and exceptions are often optional, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market. 
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member State "B"). 
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member States' regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions? 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of "fair compensation" be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answers to questions 21-27 can be summarised as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The current EU law and international treaties provide the necessary flexibility for author's rights and exceptions and limitations thereto.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Most of those exceptions and limitations do not have a cross-border aspect and where they have, the market is capable of finding solutions that address the actual issues. Thus, there is no evidenced need for such a legislative change and no need to make any other exceptions and limitations mandatory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Collective licensing of rights is a better alternative to an exception since it provides users with an easier access to protected content, offers them with the needed legal certainty, while protecting the legitimate interest of rightholders. Thus, collective management societies provide the necessary solutions for widespread access to works through dedicated licensing for e.g. teaching, educational institutions, research, etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  AKM strongly objects to the introduction of a general `fair use' exception  -  as exists in the United States  -  in Europe, because the main beneficiaries of such a system would be huge non-EU companies, who can afford to engage in long costly court procedures with unpredictable outcome at the expense of authors. Further, such a system would create legal uncertainty, because a general fair use exception is not specific to a certain type of usage, so the end-user would always need to consider whether a certain usage would be covered by fair use or not.


* Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and archiving and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject matter in the collections of such institutions. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here. 
* Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films)  -  the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

E  -  lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across borders, from institutions such as public libraries?

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So far, no libraries have approached AKM and austro mechana to license music content for online renting. To our understanding, no such service is currently provided by libraries in Austria so far.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rentals in online video services on the market are currently provided as streams or tethered downloads (E.g. downloads that can be accessed only for a limited period of time). Thus, AKM and austro mechana in principle grant licenses for the making available and the reproduction rights for these rental services.

Mass digitisation
The term "mass digitisation" is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.  Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20[th] century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing authors and publishers on the other. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting society or the recognition of an "extended effect" to the licences granted). 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

Research
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States level.

Disabilities 
Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and facilitating their distribution across the European Union) . 
The Marrakesh Treaty has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics are different terms used to describe increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.  
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without restrictions on the internet, open access). 
Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain "access" to content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases). 
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe". In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the making of so-called "user-generated content". While users can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not "new" as such. However, the development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across different sectors as a result of the "Licences for Europe" discussions.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answers to questions 58c, 59a, 60a-63 can be summarised as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  There is no established definition of `user-generated content'. Thus, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to assess if there are any difficulties and, if there are, their scope and any possible solution. According to AKM's information, the lack of a common definition was probably the only common understanding in the UGC Working Group of the Licences for Europe initiative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Platforms that distribute UGC are major digital content services and are very fast developing with an evolving end-user interaction with copyright works.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Therefore as a principle AKM stresses that:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 	a) AKM wishes to enable UGC platforms to continue their activity and encourage the creativity of the public but this requires that the platforms accept their liability as digital service providers and license the relevant rights involved for full value for operating such services and do not try to avoid their liability by invoking the safe harbour provisions of the E-Commerce Directive;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	b) 	AKM and AUSTRO MECHANA already entered into agreements with some UGC platforms and licensed the rights that are entrusted to them, i.e. communication to the public, including making available (AKM), and reproduction rights (AUSTRO MECHANA). As the adaptation right is not held by collective management societies (CMS), it cannot be licensed by a CMS unless it is agreed by the relevant rightholders;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	c)	There is no clear definition of UGC on which to evaluate a clear policy line and European policy makers should refrain from dealing with issues until they have been defined;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	d)	There is no evidence - legal, economic or social - which indicates that the copyright framework creates an effect that might restrict people's exercise of freedom of speech or participation to public debate;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	e) The fact that members of the public engage with protected works with non-commercial purposes, is not relevant to justify an exception for UGC, since the platforms offering UGC services are clearly commercial. In fact those platforms are also used for commercial purposes and what a consumer might see as non-commercial can still have economic impact on the author. Furthermore such criterion does not take into account the evolving nature of exploitation of a protected work: a work created for non-commercial purposes may very quickly have a great success and tip into the commercial sphere. Moreover being commercial or not is not a relevant criterion in copyright law, since the use of exclusive rights requires an authorisation anyway.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  For all the above reasons, AKM believes that there is no need for legislation and, even if it were considered, an UGC exception would be unjustified and contrary to the objectives sought by a sound European Digital Agenda.

Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and photocopying. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers' licence fees. 
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  The ECJ has given the necessary interpretation and guidelines to clarify the application of private copying exception and since the interpretation of other substantive issues are currently pending with the Court, there is no need to deal further with the scope and application of the system at EU level.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Rightholders have provided all the necessary practical and operational solutions to implement those decisions for a smoother and more streamlined functioning of the Internal Market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently the only missing element is the willingness of the manufacturers and distributors of recording devices (almost all of which are non-EU companies) to comply with EU law.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Private copying remuneration schemes are a key element of the Digital Eco-System and of the European cultural and artistic scene. They constitute a win-win model for all stakeholders including Member States as long as everybody plays the game. They are fully compatible with new business models, the development of new products and services and contribute to the dynamism of the market. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AKM regrets that the introduction given by the Commission to this part of the questionnaire does not give any reference to the rulings of the ECJ, which has consistently clarified and emphasised important principles on the private copying exception and its accompanying compensation. The Court also justified, to a great extent, the existing implementation of the private copy remuneration schemes in those rulings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AKM therefore believes that since those recent decisions of the ECJ gave the necessary interpretation and guidelines to clarify the application of the private copying exception and since the other outstanding substantial issues are currently dealt with by the pending cases of the Court, there is no need to further deal with the scope and application of the system at EU level. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As regards the scope and application of private copying exception and accompanying fair compensation the Court ruled that:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- concerning copies made for professional uses:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In its Padawan ruling (C-467/08), the ECJ held that Article 5.2.b) of the Info-Soc Directive must be interpreted as excluding from the private copying remuneration media or devices which are not used for private purposes. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insofar as a company can purchase media or devices which will be used for private copying (such is in particular the case of mobile phones which are purchased by a company and given to its employees who will use it for both professional and private purposes), the ECJ subjected the non-applicability of the private copying remuneration both to the purchase of the medium or device by a person not acting for a private purpose and to the fact that these media and devices are clearly reserved for purposes other than private. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore it is the nature of the usage which is key in determining the applicability of the private copying remuneration and not the person buying the media or devices, as was confirmed by the Court in its Amazon ruling (C-521/11). 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As for the implementation of such principle, it was decided in the Amazon ruling that it is perfectly possible to subject legal persons to the private copying remuneration while excluding purely professional usages by organizing (i) an exoneration scheme when it is certain that the media or devices purchased by such legal persons are so for professional purposes only (eg DVDs purchased by a medical imagery office) or (ii) in other cases, to an effective reimbursement scheme upon justification of the usage of such media or devices where there are sufficient practical difficulties to determine the purpose of the use of the purchased medium or device.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is also possible to provide for a presumption of private copying use enabling the application of the remuneration for private copying when the media and carriers are purchased by private persons provided:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) there are sufficient practical difficulties to determine the purpose of the use of the media and carrier purchased;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) the presumption is rebuttable -  this to avoid imposing a remuneration outside of a situation of private copying.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2- concerning the payee of the private copying remuneration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given the practical difficulties in identifying private users and in obliging them to compensate rightholders, the Court ruled in its Padawan decision that it is open to the Member States to establish a `private copying levy' for the purposes of financing fair compensation, chargeable not to the private persons concerned but to those who have the digital reproduction equipment, devices and media and who make that equipment available to private users or who provide copying services for them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3- concerning the coexistence of a contractual authorization and the private copying exception
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In its VG Wort decision (C-457/11 to 460/11), the ECJ held that where a Member State has decided to introduce in its national law the private copying exception, the authorization granted by the rightholders to allow the making of private copies is devoid of any legal effect.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It also clearly stated that insofar as a contractual authorization to allow the making of private copies has no legal object, it cannot have any bearing on the fair compensation which constitutes its recompense.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4- concerning social and cultural actions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After stressing that the Info-Soc Directive does not impose on Member States the obligation to ensure to rightholders the payment of all of the private copying remuneration, the ECJ ruled, in its Amazon decision, that Member States enjoy a wide discretion and therefore could provide that part of that remuneration can be provided in the form of indirect compensation as long as the scheme implemented actually benefitted the rights holders and was not discriminatory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5- concerning the cross border trade of recording media and devices
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After recalling that Member States which introduced the private copying exception have an obligation to achieve a certain result in the sense that they must guarantee to the right holders the actual payment of a fair compensation to compensate the harm arisen on their territory (as held by the Court in its Opus ruling (C-462/09)) and that the harm to be compensated materializes not at the level of the transfer of the recording media or devices but with the reproduction carried out on such media or devices by a person for a private use, the ECJ held, in its Amazon judgment, that when the place of transfer of the media and the place where the reproduction on such media or devices occurs are not the same, it is the latter point of contact which must prevail.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fact that there has been a first payment of the private copying remuneration in the country of transfer cannot be an obstacle to the payment of an analogous remuneration in the country of destination of the medium or device as it is the place where the harm is characterized. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6/ concerning the DRMs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the VG Wort case (C-457/11 to 460/11), the ECJ specified that the existence of a technological measure is not intended to eliminate the exception for private copying when the national law of the concerned Member State recognizes such exception. Only the level of fair compensation can vary depending on the application of a DRM.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pending cases ACI Adam (C‑435/12), CopyDan (Case C-463/12) and Hewlett Packard Belgium (Case C-572/13) will clarify the outstanding issues, such as consideration of copies made from illegal sources and calculation of the amount of levies paid by the manufacturers and distributors of recording devices that are subject to private copy levies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CMS offer and promote solutions that implement the above-mentioned rulings and that would ease cross-border trade in the Single Market, however the manufacturers and distributors of devices, almost all of which are non-EU companies, reject and avoid any solutions in this respect and resist to comply with the EU law, since their primary objective is maximising their profits by not paying any levies at all at the expense of creators and European creative sector.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Licensing and application of the private copying levies co-exist and they are not mutually exclusive. This point of law has also been clarified by the ECJ in its VG Wort v. Kyocera ruling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The question is not very clear, since the concept of `minimal harm' is confused with the question of application of levies when a service is licensed. Therefore AKM's answer will focus on the impact of a contractual authorisation on the application of the private copying exception, which was also addressed by Mr Vitorino's report, as referred to in footnote 59.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By stating in the first Recommendation (in Part 1 "New Business Models, Licensed Services and the Private Copying Exception") that copies made by end-users for private purposes from a licensed service do not cause any harm (therefore not requiring the corresponding remuneration from private copying levies), Mr Vitorino basically suggested eliminating private copying levies, notably for so called "new business models in the digital environment."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This represents a gross misconception of the private copying system. Practically, digital service providers that offer e.g. a download service through a licence they receive from rightholders for that download service are different than e.g. manufacturers of devices who are responsible for the payment of the levies (which they will pass on to consumers, who are actually making private copies) for the subsequent private copies of those downloads that are made by consumers. Therefore, what is licensed by a service is different from what is subject to private copy levies. Licensed services receive an authorisation for the exploitation of works based on the specificities of each business model, while the remuneration for private copying is organised through the levy-based system to guarantee that consumers are able to make private copies (as an exception to copyright), whatever the service's business model is. The ECJ in VG Wort also clearly dismissed Mr Vitorino's analysis in this respect by ruling that:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Where a Member State has decided, pursuant to a provision in Article 5(2) and (3) of Directive 2001/29, to exclude, from the material scope of that provision, any right for the rightholders to authorise reproduction of their protected works or other subject-matter, any authorising act the rightholders may adopt is devoid of legal effects under the law of that State. Consequently, such an act has no effect on the harm caused to the rightholders due to the introduction of the relevant measure depriving them of that right, and cannot therefore have any bearing on the fair compensation owed, whether it is provided for on a compulsory or an optional basis, under the relevant provision of that directive."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Licensing is seen [by Mr Vitorino] as a way of eradicating private copying levies, which is contrary to the model applied today in most EU countries where the systems are complementary. By adopting such a position, Mr Vitorino  - and this questionnaire by suggesting such a solution - goes back in time to when the very principle of the private copying exception in the digital era was challenged by those who called for the implementation of technical protection measures (TPM) instead. This was not the solution ultimately chosen in Europe under the Info-Soc Directive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Such a proposition would: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- deprive consumers of their ability to legally make copies for private purposes unless such copies have been authorised by rightholders;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- involve the re-introduction of technological protection measures which consumers have massively rejected in the past. Here again the ECJ recently ruled that the possibility of applying technological measures does not necessarily mean that the private copying remuneration is not applicable;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- require to negotiate the remuneration for private copying (which normally falls under an "exception" that cannot be negotiated) in the purchase price of the digital content, compelling the rightholders to very difficult negotiations with companies benefitting from a huge bargaining power and leading to an increase of the prices to the detriment of consumers. In any case, higher prices are difficult to achieve because of the availability of content illegally online, for free..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing  allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders' revenue on the other? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AKM considers that private copying remuneration schemes are fully compatible with the development of new business models, products and services related to digital content. The emergence of new business models, as well as of the consumer devices, has exponentially grown over the past years, without being affected by private copying remuneration schemes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The market penetration of new devices and services, such as smart phones, tablets, cloud, etc. has not been prevented by the existence of private copying remuneration schemes. On the contrary, those markets have grown exponentially over the last years. A recent study on the economic effects of private copying levies indicates that, if the private copying remuneration is removed, device manufacturers' revenues would also decrease in the long term since the incentive to invest in new content would fall. Indeed, the private copying compensation is an essential part of the copyright income for authors and composers derived from the digital market. The private copying remuneration represents on average 5% of the European authors' revenues, although with notable differences between countries. In France, one of the most important markets, revenues deriving from private copying in 2011 amounted up to 192,4 million EUR, around 43% of which was for authors (e.g. for music, audiovisual, visual art, literary authors). This means more works, jobs and growth for the whole creative chain in Europe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloud services are various and they are not homogeneous. It is therefore necessary to analyse these services on a case-by-case basis before determining the legal regime applicable to them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Furthermore, as new services emerge daily in the digital environment, labelling them as being subject to private copying levies or not, just because of the technology they use, would be restrictive and inaccurate.  These offers need to be assessed carefully according to the function and the service they deliver in each case (e.g. cloud-based download services are different than pure streaming services, or a dumb cyber-locker service would be subject to levy if its functionality is limited to storage of private copies). Moreover, as a principle,  whether a service involves private copying possibilities subject to fair compensation is a consideration to be made at the time of determining the amount of levies on a certain device and not likely to impact the emergence or development of that new service itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover AKM believes that the underlying principle for the application of private copying levies to new services needs to be assessed according to the applicable law in a given Member State. In the UK, for instance, currently there is no private copying exception and no compensation provided for. As long as there is no exception with compensation provided by the law, rightholders should be able to license those copies through their exclusive rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Member States where private copying compensation is provided should extend the scope of levies to the services that allow individual consumers to copy their copyright content for private purposes on their devices. In this respect, the ECJ in its Padawan ruling several times mentions that private copying could be made not only by "digital reproduction equipment, devices and media but also by copying services". Depriving authors and composers from this income would seriously harm their earnings and would take away one of their well-established direct revenue streams on the basis of ill-founded assumptions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AKM totally agrees with the objective but does not believe that this technical point requires a legislative change at EU level within the Info-Soc Directive. This is certainly not a big problem in terms of cross-border application of levies; in fact, it is already applied in some Member States and its application can easily be extended to all Member States with the agreement of all stakeholders involved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visibility through giving information to consumers about the amount that is paid as private copying compensation is one of the key elements to achieve trust and clarity in the market. Moreover this is also a crucial issue in terms of transparency in how the levies are applied, who has paid what and how the refund schemes could efficiently be processed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Applied levy tariffs should be separately indicated on all invoices and contracts throughout the supply chain and on final consumers' invoices and/or receipts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The final consumer should also be adequately informed of the purpose of the applicable copyright exception and of the levy. Such provisions, already implemented now in some EU Member States (see France), should be extended at EU level.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, this is a purely technical matter that does not justify on its own the reopening of the Info-Soc Directive.
Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments.  

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.). 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help to remedy the situation? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answers to this section and the questions 68 to 71 can be summarised as follows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. As pointed out in answer to question 64 above the ECJ has already clarified all these issues in its recent judgments. As long as the rulings of the Court are followed there is no need for any further legislative `clarification' at EU level.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The Commission, however, should focus its efforts more on stopping the worrying situations in Spain and the UK that are in contradiction with EU law.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Commission should introduce appropriate legal measures to grant rightholders and CMS as    their representatives a more effective rights enforcement and control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Spanish law, which entered into force in 2012, and the following legislative and administrative actions taken by the Spanish government are clearly against the principle of providing the rightholders with a "fair compensation". It also deviates from the basic principle that such compensation is to be paid by those who make the actual copies and, which is, for the ease of its application, to be collected from the manufacturers and distributors of the recording devices that are subject to levies (please see our answer to question 64 for the relevant ECJ rulings).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The UK government proposed a private copying exception without any fair compensation, which is totally in contradiction with the provision of the Info-Soc Directive and the above-mentioned rulings of the ECJ.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current Austrian system works very well, enjoys wide acceptance and does not lead to any undue payments. Undue payments are avoided by a smart reimbursement scheme which allows differentiating between private and commercial users. About one third of all blank media in Austria (including hard discs) are used by commercial entities. Cross-border transactions are no issue since any importer and direct seller of blank media in or to Austria has to pay the levy (NB: There are no relevant producers of blank media in Austria). The importer or direct seller may obtain reimbursement of a foreign levy from that Member State, in accordance with the Amazon ruling.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to the increase of problems with online distributors, direct sellers should be subject to stronger control and enforcement by the collecting societies. The current enforcement regime is inadequate to fight abuse and circumvention of the private copying regime. Such measures could involve an obligation to deposit monies at the courts, legally unhindered data exchange between CMS of different Member States, or legal actions being more rapid and effective than the currently established court procedures.
Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from authors or performers to producers or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different sectors of the creative industries. 
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.  Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answers to questions 72-74 can be summarised as follows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Whether for offline or online exploitations, collective management is the best solution to strike a balance between ease of rights clearance, legal certainty and adequate remuneration for authors and composers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.	Authors' societies grew out of the need for authors to join forces if they were to control the exploitation of their works and to negotiate fair terms of remuneration with users which their weak bargaining position as individuals would have prevented them from obtaining
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.	For many reasons, the individual author is rarely able to enforce his/her rights effectively without his/her authors' society:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	-	 the increasingly diverse ways of using works makes it difficult and illusory for an author to exert personal control over the use made of his works 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- 	even with today's technologies, authors cannot learn how to manage the efficient exploitation of their rights across all different media around the world overnight, not all can afford the relevant investment;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- 	it is also manifestly clear that the individual author stands in a weak bargaining position compared to increasingly economically powerful users.  If they are not to be deprived of their rightful remuneration, authors must rely on institutions which they can trust to manage their rights for them
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	-	collective management offers high standards in terms of transparency and accountability and the individual author is ensured to have his/her rights managed  on a non-discriminatory basis. In this respect, the recent CRM Directive provides high standards for governance and rights management, for the benefit of authors and composers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.	 Authors' societies play a vital role in ensuring that authors are paid the royalties they are entitled to, by defending their interests, engaging in negotiations with users, monitoring exploitations, and collecting and adequately distributing royalties to their members and, through their sister societies, to foreign rights holders
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.	It is essential, for authors' societies to effectively protect the rights and interest of their members in dealings with important and powerful third parties, that they received an exclusive assignment of rights from their members. It is the only way to prevent individual rightholders being pressured into disadvantageous agreements.
Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this text. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial purpose. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure. At the same time, there could be clarification of the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough to allow for  sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved between the right to have one's copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answers to questions 75-77 can be summarised as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The enforcement of rights is essential for the others to respect one's right. This rule of the real world applies the same in the digital world
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.	Using the word "commercial" and trying to give a certain definition as a criterion for enforcement is not a productive approach. In a rapidly changing internet environment it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine which acts have commercial relevance and for whom. Moreover, leaving all "non-commercial" acts, whatever it would mean, outside of protection would not comply with the respect for the exclusive rights provided by EU law and international treaties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.	Commerce Directive is incomprehensible. In order to clarify the role of any intermediary to ensure higher level of respect for rights, the safe harbour regime provided by the E-Commerce Directive needs to be re-considered for copyright related activities.
A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States' legal systems. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement? 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answers to questions 78-79 can be summarised as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to the differences in system and content within the Copyright Acts/Authors' Rights Acts of the various European countries that have naturally evolved over the years, the harmonization of copyright in the EU is a political challenge.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instead of aiming at the immediate goal of a comprehensive framework, it appears to be more efficient and effective to continue the step-by-step harmonization process of the past years and concentrate on virulent topics first, if they appear. At the moment the rights provided by copyright/authors' right are to a great extent harmonised at EU level and the existing EU legislative acts ensure a high standard of protection.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus, AKM is of the opinion that there is no need for the complete harmonisation of Copyright Law/Authors' Rights Law within the EU. The existing EU legislative acts already ensure a high standard of copyright/authors' right protection.
Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so they can be properly addressed in the future.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A very important issue with relation to the EU legal framework of copyright/authors' right at the moment is adequate remuneration of creators in the digital environment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although the services, options and technologies that enable the public in general to access and to enjoy creative works multiply every day, earnings of individual authors still decrease. The value generated by digital technologies that owe their success mostly to access to creative works is not fairly shared with the creators of those works.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a transfer of value in favour of technical intermediaries such as host providers, access providers, search engines, etc. which generate high revenues thanks to the use of copyright protected works and demand of consumers for `broader'-bands to use creative works.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The activity of many of these service providers is not limited to a mere conduit or stocking of information: they are designed to make content available, organise the means they put at the public's disposal to access such content, develop special search engines, develop software to enable consumers to view and listen to the content and seek to valorise the access given to protected content through advertising strategies. These intermediaries carry out acts of reproduction and/or of communication to the public for which they would be considered liable if they did not benefit from the "safe harbour regime" under the E-commerce Directive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those Internet intermediaries, who are harvesting the benefits of consumers' wider access demand that the creative content generates, are not responsible for the content that is trafficked/circulated on their networks and platforms on the basis of the safe harbour regime set up by the E-commerce Directive. Therefore they do not accept most licensing requests and show reluctance in enforcing or monetising the content on their networks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All around the world the rightholders are trying to establish the responsibility of these Internet intermediaries, through court proceedings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is becoming more and more obvious that a regulatory initiative would be needed to ensure the balance for the value generated from the use of creative works. We are aware of the fact that the Commission adamantly opposes opening of E-Commerce Directive for various reasons. We also believe that E-Commerce Directive is a horizontal directive that has an impact on many important principles such as net neutrality, privacy, freedom of expression, etc. And opening that Directive only for this specific purpose could have undesirable consequences in terms of other rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AKM, therefore, believes that the current debate on modernisation of copyright would be an appropriate opportunity to underline this fundamental problem that the creative sector is facing. Tackling this would allow a wider modernisation of the European policy applicable to digital economy by i) providing more legal certainty for the citizens when engaging with creative content online, ii) flourishing of new legitimate online services within a more secure frameworks and iii) more adequate remuneration of rightholders for the use of their works in digital era.
