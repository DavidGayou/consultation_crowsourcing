II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere
in Europe?

2. Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across
borders in the EU?

YES

Market developments, driven by the emergence of new devices and changes in customer
behaviour, have created subscribers’ desire to access the content distributed by Liberty
Global on multiple devices at any time and regardless of their location and mostly via
simultaneous and multi device use. In fact, subscribers want the channels and other content
(e.g. Video on Demand, Catch up TV services) offered by Liberty Global to be “portable”, i.e.
in the home, in the country, in Europe and beyond and available on their second/ third
screen devices (e.g. tablets and smartphones).

Liberty Global has launched new services, like the Horizon TV platform (in the Netherlands,
Germany, Switzerland and Ireland) and the TiVo box in the UK to meet such customer
demand, e.g. services enabling cable subscribers to watch their content on computers,
tablets and/or smartphones.

Liberty Global and its subsidiaries, active in 12 European markets, are however experiencing
difficulties to obtain the necessary rights for distributing these services. In particular, we
are facing significant difficulties to obtain the “out- of- home” rights needed to enable our
subscribers to access their content when outside of their home, be it in their country of
origin or abroad. These difficulties range from refusals to grant the necessary rights due to
abuses of dominant positions of collective management organizations (“CMOs”) – which
unfortunately tend to request unreasonable and unjustified license tariffs – as well as to the
burden caused by the fragmentation of rights across national boundaries and unreasonable
requests for remuneration for each additional type of device or location. They constitute a
significant barrier to innovation in distribution technologies.

Amendments to the current legal framework should address these issues in order to
promote an innovative and efficient single market for content services within and across
national borders, taking into account technology neutrality and portability.

Whilst there is an increasing demand from customers to be able to access content provided
by Liberty Global across borders, collective management organizations (CMOs) almost
exclusively represent the interests of rights holders at a national level and cannot, or will not
offer multi-territorial licenses. For example, Liberty Global has been confronted with CMOs
who refuse to allow foreign broadcasters to offer their channels ‘all rights included’, or ARI
(as broadcasters are offering in the Netherlands and in Belgium) to Liberty Global, but rather
insist on only dealing with each Liberty Global subsidiary in their own country. CMOs even
obstruct the clearance of online rights within member states by using their dominant
positions to request unreasonable and unjustified license tariffs.

                                                                                               3
The clearing of rights is therefore in many cases characterized by a high degree of
inefficiency and a lack of transparency in license fee structure, causing Liberty Global to
incur important transaction and opportunity costs. Since copyrights licensed to Liberty Global
is often geographically restricted and clearing the rights for different or all Member States is
burdensome, content provided by Liberty Global to their subscribers will often not be
accessible abroad.

4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above –
what would be the best way to tackle them?

While question 2 focuses on problems faced when accessing or providing online services,
Liberty Global wishes to stress that EU regulation should not be limited to targeting these
services. Offline and digital services are indeed in constant expansion, and the business
models of the various operators are converging. Offline and digital service should thus also
be included when measures are taken at the EU level.

Liberty Global is of the opinion that an improved, more effective, more efficient, more
competitive and more consistent, transparent, technology neutral rights
management and clearance system for copyrighted works across Europe is
needed.

It should be possible to clear the rights needed to distribute content on normal,
commercially viable conditions and once the rights have been cleared and the subscribers of
the distribution platforms are known, these customers should be granted a portability right.
Subscribers of Liberty Global should indeed be able to benefit from their subscription
anywhere and on any screen or device of their choice, regardless of their location.

Liberty Global encourages the adoption of measures at the EU level that tackle these issues.
However, we would like to stress that policy makers should not pick winners in a given
market. The regulatory framework should therefore have the same operational and cost
impact irrespective of the exploitation form (satellite, cable, PTV, internet, mobile). The
measures taken at the EU level should also avoid discrimination between cable operators
and over the top (“OTT”) players (such as Hulu, Netflix and Magine).

The new system should moreover enhance transparency and legal certainty regarding the
copyright regime that will apply. The market behaviour of CMOs should be regulated ex ante
to avoid abuse of their dominant positions (which today is common in several member
states), and competition between collective management organizations should be
encouraged to increase the efficiency of the system and help to drive a single market
forward. It is however key to avoid the accumulation of market power with only two to
three large collective management organizations in Europe.

An approach Liberty Global would advocate is the creation of a single licence delivered by a
one stop shop system, a content passport. This content passport would be optional for
copyright users, e.g. in the event of rightholders – such as broadcasters – not being able or
willing to provide “all-rights-included” offers (“ARI”). (For the relationship between ARI
offers and licenses, please see the response to question 10). The single license would be


                                                                                                4
created for clearance of all content exploitation forms (fixed, mobile, online, cable, DTT, etc)
both at the horizontal (i.e. multi-territory) and the vertical (i.e. one negotiation partner only)
level.

The single license should firstly allow Liberty Global to clear – if needed - all rights necessary
to provide the content they want to their subscribers. The system should however be
flexible. It should allow users to choose their preferred option and provide the possibility to
clear only the rights they need, e.g. rights not already covered by broadcasters’ ARI offers.

Secondly, Liberty Global, active in several territories should be given the option to choose
for pan-European/multi-territory licensing. Liberty Global however wants to stress that, if a
multi-national licensing system is created, service providers active on a purely national,
regional and/or local level should have the same competitive conditions as international
providers. It has to be prevented that a two speed market is created, where a company
operating on a European single market basis would have a better regulatory/operational
environment than a company operating on a national/regional basis. Moreover EU
regulation should not undermine existing national regimes where those regimes are
delivering positive benefits to end-users.

It will also need to be ensured that the copyright users will be able to obtain effective
judicial/quasi-judicial remedies against excessive remuneration claims by rightholders – both
domestic and foreign. As things stand, the existing national licensing systems already pose
significant hurdles in this regard.

6. Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it
necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in
order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the one
he is trying to access)?

YES

Liberty Global considers that service operators should have the possibility to impose
territorial restrictions under certain circumstances. This may be necessary if differences
between the various markets or national regulations of the Member States justify differences
in the terms and conditions of the retail offer. In addition, national or regional players
should not be required to clear rights for territories outside of their footprint.



B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions? [The definition of the rights involved
in digital transmissions]

The act of “making available”




                                                                                                 5
8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e.
when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

NO

We believe that the scope of the “making available” right is insufficiently clear in in cross-
border situations. Directive 2001/29/EC does not specify where the act of “making available”
takes place. This causes legal uncertainty when content is being made available in several
territories. Recent case law of the CJEU which suggests that the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the
online service provider is not particularly helpful, as it is not always clear which
audiences/territories are targeted.

E.g. current practice is that operators of distribution platforms clear the rights on a country
by country basis, for their service areas where their subscribers have their residence.
However, once the rights have been cleared in this way and the target audiences of the
subscribers of the distribution platforms are known, these national consumers should be
granted a portability right (to other territories and to other devices of their choice). Once
rights have been cleared by the service provider, the subscribers should be in a position to
enjoy his subscription anywhere and on any device of their choice. The current regime does
not support this, or at least leaves too much uncertainty.



9. Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right
have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered
to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your
rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including
the availability of injunctive relief)?

NO OPINION



Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

10. Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in
the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

YES

The fact that - from a technological perspective - each act of transmission in digital
networks also entails one or more reproductions, complicates the licensing of works for
online use, notably when the two rights are held by different persons/entities. The
application of rules should first and foremost protect content and place less of an emphasis
on its specific means of delivery. Protection of content must not translate into the
obstruction of legal distribution.



                                                                                               6
In order for cable companies to streamline their transaction and management costs, a
technology neutral, all rights included, central clearance system should be introduced,
characterized by the following principles:

      Broadcasters to clear all rights necessary for communication to the public;
      Broadcasters thereby to offer fully cleared packages;
      Broadcasters and content providers to have the opportunity to clear all their relevant
       rights at one organisation of choice at European level;
      Competition between collecting societies to support the development of fair market
       prices;
      Clearing mechanisms to be established to guarantee fair distribution of fees.


This system would lead to an increased market efficiency and effectiveness, to competition
between the collecting societies and to a fair market value of copyright prices. This system
would be beneficial for all parties involved.



C. Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?

15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?

YES

A central register or work, or a rights ownership database, would in theory be a helpful
measure, in particular databases that allow parties interested in exploiting copyrights to
determine who in fact holds such rights in order to reduce instances of double
remuneration.

We note with interest the development of a digital copyright exchange in the UK, and at
European level the International Standard Audis-visual Number a not-for-profit Swiss
association based in Geneva established by major collecting societies CISAC, AGICOA and
others , and mandated by ISO for implementing, running and managing the ISAN standard,
the ISAN system and a central database.


16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

Whilst the concept of a European centralized database is one we support as it has the
potential to help creators, content providers and rights holders to license rights more quickly
and with greater certainty, its governance model and operating procedures must be a
constructed to ensure full independence.

17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?




                                                                                               7
In order to ensure that no stakeholder in the rights clearance value chain is able to unduly
influence administrative activities, we would encourage the European Commission to take an
active role in ensuring its management and administration are fully independent.

More practically, LGI operating affiliates would want to be part of an independent
verification process prior to the rights being input into the database to diminish the
likelihood of misleading or inaccurate information that could hinder the acquisition of rights.

A robust procedure for dispute resolution, and in instances where this is invoked, a full
indemnification against counter claims whilst the procedure is on-going, are additional
safeguards which would need to be built into operating procedures. There should also be no
obligation to consult the database.



IV. Private copying and reprography

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
application of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital
environment?

YES

The term and the area of application of private copying should be defined more clearly as
there are no common provisions across all member states. In some member states, such as
Germany for example, it is possible to make a copy to a limited extent of a work protected
by copyright for private use, as an exception to the author’s sole right of reproduction. In
return, the author receives a so-called device or blank media levy, which is charged by the
performing rights society, in Germany by the ZPÜ, for devices with a recording function.

Originally, the legislator enabled legal private copying because with the emergence of
recording devices such as tape recorders, video and cassette recorders private individuals
could also reproduce works and it was no longer necessary to control homes. Due to
technical progress end users now have more ways of reproducing works, for instance there
are now also virtual network PVRs where the work is stored virtually and can be accessed
from anywhere. However, so far statutory provisions have not been adapted to take account
of these developments.

For the end user it makes no difference whether they save a film on their conventional video
recorder or in the cloud on a so-called network PVR. For the provider of the film there is a
difference though: due to the underlying technical view in Germany, for example, the
provider of the film would have to clarify up to four rights to legitimize the use of a network
PVR. This would create disproportionate additional outlay. To ensure innovation and the
development of new services, use cases must be considered and the same usage forms
subject to the same licensing obligation, regardless of the underlying technical processes.

In the UK (using the TiVo platform) and in several other Liberty Global territories (Germany
Netherlands, Switzerland, Ireland) we have introduced PVR set top boxes (STBs) providing

                                                                                                  8
customers with the ability to make recordings of broadcast recordings that have been made
to the hard drive of STBs, and additionally the potential to stream such recordings to other
devices such as personal computers and tablets. It is also technically possible to move
content from a PVR device and store on another for viewing later.

Such consumer centric technology innovations give rise to need for a broader private
copyright exception to allow private copying and format shifting on a device neutral basis.

Given it is unclear what conditions need to be complied with for them to fall within the
scope of the private copying exceptions across various Member States, we would welcome
initiatives to clarify and harmonize the scope of the private copying exceptions (article 5.2b
of Directive EC/29/2001).

One such initiative being discussed in the UK is to widen the scope of the copyright
definition under s.70 of CDPA 1998 from the current limited exception that enables private
copying for ‘time shifting’ purposes, to extend to encompass in-home use, time-shifted use
or recording at the request of a service provider.

By implementing an exception to copyright that does not simply legitimise a particular,
currently-known activity (i.e. format shifting) but recognises as lawful a class of generic,
technology neutral activities (i.e. ‘personal use activities’), this will future proof legislation.


65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the
rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?

NO

Private copies should essentially be possible, but without an additional licence fee. As per
the conclusions of arising from the Recommendations of the 2013 Mediation on Private
Copying and Reprography Levies led by former Commissioner António Vitorino, copies made
by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by right
holders do not cause any harm that would require additional remuneration in the form of
private copying levies.


66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online
services (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to
have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new
business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

Liberty Global is of the opinion that changes to the regulatory regime requiring additional
levies with respect to online services could hinder innovation and the development of new
business models responding to consumer’s expectations. In turn this could increase the cost
to consumers of such innovation.




                                                                                                      9
Without further detail as to the price calculation and involvement of stakeholders in such a
process, we are unable to give our support to the use of levies as the most efficient means
of rights compensation for online services.

Whilst it can be argued that imposing levies for online services creates more legal certainty
for distributors, on balance we believe it would not create additional economic benefit
either to distributor nor rights holder in order to outweigh the costs of collecting these
revenues, and the negative impact it would have on innovation.


VI. Respect for rights

75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

NO

Liberty Global condemns unlawful acquisition and consumption of copyright protected
content, and other unlawful material, in both the off and online context. Rights holders need
to be duly remunerated for their work and a proper legislative instrument to enforce these
rights and combat infringing activities should be in place.

However, we consider it premature to review the existing Directive 2004/48/EC on the
enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRED). As the European Commission rightly
points out in its own report on IPRED, due to the late transposition in many Members
States, experience in applying the Directive is limited.

We believe that the current legal framework as it stands offers a well-balanced and
functioning framework to address digital piracy, and provides sufficient provisions to support
rights holders in enforcing their rights. At present, there is no convincing evidence that a
revision is needed and therefore it would be premature to introduce stricter enforcement
measures before the existing Directive is properly implemented.

In our view, it would be appropriate for the European Commission to direct further efforts
toward the consistent implementation of Directive 2004/48 and Directive 2001/29 at a
national level, to minimize divergences between Member States. Fragmentation of the
European internal market causes legal uncertainties and unnecessary costs for both rights
holders and pan-European players like ourselves.

We would caution against the use of notification mechanisms which would require
intermediaries – without prior intervention of a court – to block access to or remove
information based upon mere allegations by a rightsholder. Similarly, we oppose notification
mechanisms that require intermediaries to suspend user accounts without prior intervention
of a Court. Such mechanisms can only be put in place by a competent judicial authority to
prevent precautionary private censorship and a threat to fundamental rights, such as the
right to due process, the protection of personal data and the freedom of expression.

                                                                                             10
Instead, we believe the European Commission should focus on encouraging and
incentivising compelling, affordable legal alternatives to piracy for consumers thereby
creating new sources of revenues for creators.



76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for
sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers,
advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in
inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not,
what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

YES

The current legal framework already enables rights holders to apply for an injunction against
intermediaries whose services are being used by a third party to infringe their rights,
including for commercial purposes (Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/29 and the third sentence
of Article 11 of Directive 2004/48). These mechanisms proved to be efficient for rights
holders in the enforcement of their rights, especially with regards to commercial
infringement, and are widely used across Europe.

At the same time article 12-15 of the E-Commerce Directive ensure that such injunctions are
proportionate and cannot result in general monitoring obligations . We would like to point
out that the services that Liberty Global offers are provided in an affordable and competitive
way under this Directive (2000/31/EC).

This Directive provides a framework for both the provision of basic services which
safeguard the continued free flow of information across the network, and the establishment
of a framework which allows the internet and e-commerce to develop. The provisions on the
exemption from liability of intermediaries for communications across their networks serve to
provide a secure and predictable legal base for intermediaries to connect Europeans to the
Internet and to many other forms of electronic communications, applications and services.
These principles are fundamental to our business model and need to remain unchanged.

We would caution against any new measures that would lead to a general monitoring
obligation for ISPs. Besides broader questions as to their technical efficacy, filtering
methods also risk over-blocking of legitimate content leading to negative consequences for
European consumers and businesses in terms of user experience, connection speed and the
price of Internet connections.

In our view the introduction of a filtering mechanism is a slippery slope, would be in conflict
with the acquis communautaire and has numerous potential negative consequences for
fundamental rights such as privacy, freedom of speech and of expression and the freedom
to do business. The CJEU has confirmed this in a number of judgements it has issued
providing guidance on the balance to be struck between the different rights and interests


                                                                                             11
affected (see for example Cases C-324/09, L’Oréal and Others, C-70/10, Scarlet Extended,
and C-360/10, Sabam).

As a pan-European operator, we observe that the European landscape is still fragmented in
many different laws and rulings on national and EU level. Liberty Global believes further
guidance on the implementation of the existing legal framework would benefit creating a
harmonized single market, in order to avoid patchwork of different rules within the EU and
an increasingly complex legal landscape for intermediaries within which to operate.

Therefore, Liberty Global would welcome a Commission initiative to translate the CJEU
judgments into clear guidelines for national authorities and courts so as to facilitate a
consistent approach across Member States.



77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance
is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights
such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?

YES

The CJEU has repeatedly insisted on the need to strike a right balance between the right of
copyright owners to have their copyright respected and the fundamental rights and
freedoms of other affected parties, such as the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by
intermediaries, the freedom of speech and information of consumers, and the right to the
protection of one’s privacy and personal data. The CJEU has also provided guidance as to
the delineation of what such balance must look like.

Liberty Global therefore believes that the current civil enforcement framework sufficiently
ensures the right balance between copyright and fundamental rights and freedoms. It would
nonetheless be useful for the Commission to translate the relevant CJEU case law into clear
guidelines for national authorities and courts so as to facilitate a consistent approach across
Member States.

These guidelines should include a number of principles to ensure that all Member States
consistently ensure both copyright and fundamental rights and freedoms.

First of all, it is important to ensure that personal data can only be provided after the
intervention of a court. Due legal process and judicial oversight are a prerequisite within a
legitimate framework. Network operators cannot, and should not, define the scope of
possible illegal activity as the responsibility to enforce the law remains in the responsibility of
public authorities. Therefore a court order should always set out the exact conditions and
process under which an injunctions is granted and personal data should be shared.
Furthermore, in cases where the court order based on which the information is disclosed is
later overthrown the ISP should not be held liable for the illegal disclosure of personal data.

Secondly, access to illegal content may only be blocked after intervention of a court or other
competent authority. We would consider a tendency to ‘privatise’ law enforcement a

                                                                                                12
dangerous trend. Transferring the burden of judgment regarding potentially unlawful
material from a qualified judge to ISPs will endanger the open internet and fundamental
rights such as the freedom of expression, impact customer interests and rights and hinder
competition on the Internet.

Therefore litigation and injunctions should be the final resort for stakeholders, not the
solution to solve copyright infringements and other illegal content. Courts and authorities
should therefore refrain from imposing Injunctions to intermediaries if these injunctions will
not lead to an effective reduction of infringements of the copyright protected material
and/or of the harm or damage inflicted upon the rights holder.

Thirdly, the costs for complying with information requests and injunctions should not be
borne exclusively by the intermediaries. It is important to note that ISPs are not itself
committing or condoning the alleged infringements, but because of its supposed position of
control may be ordered to implement all kinds of enforcement measures. The litigation
proceedings as well as the implementation of the various measures that are imposed on us
are extremely costly and an unfair burden to place on one sector. There should be additional
guidance from the Commission on the compensation of these costs by the rights holders.
More interpretative guidelines in this respect would be welcomed, given the high frequency
and total number of requests we face.

Last but not least, injunctions should be a final resort and the Commission should underline
in its guidelines that these cannot be a replacement for investments in new business models
for online content and the creation of attractive legal offers to combat piracy, which we
believe is the right way forward to end counterfeiting and piracy and give consumers the
