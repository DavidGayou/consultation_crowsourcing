                       Urheberrechts
  European Commission public consultation on the review of
                 the EU copyright rules


Der Bundesverband Digitale Wirtschaft (BVDW) e.V. ist die Interessenvertretung für
Unternehmen der Online-Branche. Der BVDW wurde 1995 als erster Verband für die digitale
Wirtschaft in Deutschland gegründet und vereint heute rund 600 Unternehmen unter seinem
Dach. Der BVDW arbeitet interdisziplinär und bildet alle Segmente der digitalen Wirtschaft ab.
Im ständigen Dialog mit Politik, Öffentlichkeit und anderen Interessengruppen unterstützt der
BVDW die dynamische Entwicklung der Branche. Die Summe aller Kompetenzen der Mitglieder,
gepaart mit den definierten Werten und Emotionen des Verbandes, bilden die Basis für das
Selbstverständnis des BVDW. Wir sind das Netz.

Die Europäische Kommission hat am 5. Dezember 2013 eine öffentliche Konsultation zur
Überprüfung des europäischen Urheberrechts als Teil des Überprüfungsprozesses eröffnet, den
die Europäische Kommission bereits 2011 angekündigt hatte.

Der BVDW dankt für die Gelegenheit zur Stellungnahme und beantwortet nachfolgend die aus
Sicht des Verbandes relevanten Fragen der öffentlichen Konsultation.



1. Have you faced problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than
the one in which you live?
Generally, a well-tailored copyright framework may benefit the majority of consumers by
offering them choice, as it allows for content tailored to their culture and language, delivered
by many means of distribution and under different commercial propositions (i.e. terrestrial,
cable, satellite, IPTV, online; free/advertising-based, pay TV, TVoD, SVoD, etc.).
The market is increasingly addressing demand for cross-border delivery of content, in
particular where this appears economically meaningful in the light of established business
models. The assessment of the bigger picture, however, depends on a number of different
factors which will be analysed in the following answers.


2. Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?
Music
- The clearing of rights becomes more and more difficult. Here we see an important need for
action. If right holders of music continue to exercise their discretion in the matter of multi-
territorial licensing, this will – as has previously been the case and contrary to what the
Commission clearly hopes will happen – lead to a situation in which a few individual right
holders will continue to cherry pick and remove “lucrative repertoire” from collecting societies
and grant multi-territorial licences separately. The remaining repertoire will continue to be
acquired by the national collecting societies. This does not involve a simplification of pan-
European licensing but, entirely counter to the declared aim, reinforces the status quo which
the Commission itself has found to be inadequate, and may even lead to increased
fragmentation of the music repertoire. The newly introduced right holder’s ”right to choose”
their collecting society in Art. 5 (2) of the last draft of the CRM directive is also expected to
further complicate clearing processes.

Audiovisual Content
- On the contrary the cross border access to audiovisual content online is not hampered by the
current copyright framework. There are no legal or technical obstacles to do this: if a service
provider wishes to make audiovisual content available on a multi-territory basis, it is a question
of weighing the consumer demand for such a service against the cost of implementing it and
acquiring the necessary rights from the relevant right holder(s).
- This assessment of economic feasibility involves an evaluation of (i) consumer demand in the
target markets; (ii) language and cultural specificity; and (iii) the cost of marketing a service in
foreign territories (as well as providing adequate quality of service and customer support).
Different consumer protection rules across the EU also need to be assessed.


3. How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the
type of content concerned.
- Licensing of audiovisual works in the EU is a matter of individual negotiation between
producers and audiovisual media service providers. Producers own or represent all of the right
holders’ rights and are therefore capable of delivering mono-territory and multi-territory
licenses for audiovisual works.
- Genarally, producers of audiovisual content grant multi-territorial licences, for example
licences for Europe or for World. These multi-territorial licences are granted to between ten and
twenty different broadcasters and service providers (for different programmes), and make up
approximately 25% of all licence requests to FMM. It is however important to have the
contractual freedom to determine the geographical reach of the licence in order to receive
adequate sales revenue, as the licence will be tailored to reflect the technological reach,
customers and outputs of the content providers themselves. This in turn allows for sustainable
monetisation of the content and re-investment in new programming.
- The market is also reflecting new technological developments: FMM have recently signed a
multi-territory deal with Netflix, which covers the Netherlands and the UK. This covers all types
of content for internet streaming on a subscription basis. In addition, it also has a deal with
iTunes covering Germany, France and the UK.
- From a commercial broadcaster perspective, demand for (linear) broadcasts is based on
language zones.


4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what would be the
best way to tackle them?
- The fact that it is not always possible to access online services in EU Member States other
than the one in which consumers reside, can be addressed without jeopardising the ability of
right holders to license rights in a way that allows them to maintain their ability to invest in
European content (i.e. to a single territory or multiple territories, depending on the economic
case to be made).



                                                                                              Seite 2
- For example, it may be possible to address the issue by promoting the ability of residents of
one territory to access content and services from that same territory while in other EU
countries. Solutions such as this were discussed during the Licences for Europe stakeholder
dialogue, and different models are currently being trialed by broadcasters (e.g. one-day
subscription to premium sports content so a consumer can watch a live football game while
abroad).
- To achieve legal certainty, providers of online music services need to conclude one agreement
for the entire global repertoire. This should be legislatively guaranteed on EU level. It is
generally impracticable to exclude individual licensors from agreements because pieces of
music are delivered by the owners of ancillary copyright and the lack of sufficient information
and the complex situation with regard to rights means that copyright owners cannot be traced
beyond reasonable doubt or definitively. Also once the CRM-directive will have been adopted
the EU legislation does still not provide adequate safeguards to ensure that the repertoire of all
societies have access to multi-territorial licensing. In terms of the current proposal of the CRM-
directive there is no reference to any pressure to the collecting societies to outsource the rights
management if they themselves do not wish to grant multi-territorial licences. We therefore
propose to oblige collecting societies to contract with each other in order to ensure the
necessary accessibility of rights and also to contract with right users who seek clearance.


5. Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories
in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service
provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain
European countries)?
Yes. If for instance a producer has the intention to export a certain format or program abroad,
this may be a valid business reason to impose territorial restrictions despite holding all the
rights, given that its value will decrease in case viewers in the target country have already
viewed the content online.
If all content was made available worldwide, funding received by producers from local
broadcasters would necessarily decrease, which would result in a drop in production expenses
in the local territory. As a consequence, there would be no resale market for local content and
this would lead to a drop in revenue to producers and local broadcasters. Finally, this would
cause a loss of cultural diversity brought by the production of localised versions.


6. Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions
on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than
the one he is trying to access)?
Generally and upon condition that rights clearance has been positively achieved, the cross-
border provision of service should be an option.
Apart from this, restrictions may be an option in the context of income being generated by
advertising. Advertising markets are national, meaning that - for instance for a commercial
free-to-air broadcaster – making content available cross borders requires prior assessment of
whether this is viable from both an economic and technical standpoint (namely, whether it is
possible to generate advertising revenues in the target market). This may be achieved by
different technical means depending on the delivery platform in question.




                                                                                                    Seite 3
7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions)
are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single
Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
Please refer to the answers provided to questions 2 and 4.


10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a
single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for
you?
Yes, it should be clarified that the right of making available and the corresponding reproduction
right necessary for one technical and economic process may not be split and represented by
different right holders. Therefore the making available right should always include the right of
reproduction as far as the right of making available cannot be used without the right of
reproduction. To offer content to users via online, mobile or broadcast platforms the
reproduction on the server of the service provider is a necessary condition for the making
available of such content.
From both perspectives the application of two rights for one act of exploitation creates
problems with regard to the distribution of content by providers and causes additional costs. It
would it be preferable to require that for online exploitations these two rights be bundled
together and cleared through a single entity. While this is done in some Member States, it is
not the case in others where different collective management organisations manage the two
rights.

In the past both rights (right of reproduction and right of making available) necessary for the
online and mobile exploitation of music were granted by the respective collecting societies in
Europe. As a result of the EU-Recommendation in 2005 anglo-american music publishers
withdrew their right of reproduction from the collective management by collecting societies.
The right of making available for the respective musical works remained within collective
management. Therefore the situation now is that both licensing systems - collective rights
management and single licensing - apply for one musical work used in one economic process.
The aim of facilitating the licensing process for the content provider through collective rights
management is jeopardised.
To solve this problem it should be clarified that the right of making available and the
corresponding reproduction right necessary for one economic process may not be split and
represented by different rights holder. To offer content to users via online and mobile platforms
the reproduction on the server of the service provider is a necessary condition for the making
available of such content.


11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under
copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?
There is no authorization of a rightholder necessary, as far as simple hyperlinks are concerned
- i.e. mere references to a collection of resources online.




                                                                                                 Seite 4
12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or
other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s
computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?
Generally, web-browsing creates temporary copies that are covered by the exception
established in Article 5 (1) of Directive 2001/29/EC and do not constitute an infringement of
copyright. For example in case of viewing of film shots - the streaming needs a temporary,
ephemeral duplication by buffering in the cache, however this process is taking place
automatically without being perceived by the user and the copy is also automatically deleted,
without any human intervention, after a certain time.
Therefore, an exception for the reproduction right of end-users with regard to temporary
reproductions of a work or subject matter on screen or in the cache memory of their computer
is acceptable, as long as the use of the temporary reproduction is restricted to (legal) private
use.


14. What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of
previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
Exhaustion is a limitation to copyright that was conceived for physical goods in order to allow
the first buyer of an item to resell it without interference of the right holder. This reflected (i)
the perishable nature of physical goods and the loss of value suffered over time due to wear
and tear and (ii) the fact that, when a physical good is resold, it is no longer in the possession
of the original owner.
Due to their nature, digital goods cannot be “exhausted” by distribution: the resold item is
identical to the original and imperishable. One purchased digital copy could potentially be
resold millions of times, which would destroy the first market. In addition, the digital nature of
the good makes it difficult to identify a particular ‘item’ and assess whether it has been resold
without complex technical protection measures.
- A general rule of non-exhaustion for communication to the public rights has been codified in
Article 3(3) of the Information Society Directive and Recital 29, which states that “the question
of exhaustion does not arise in the case of services and online services in particular”.
- In practice, such a limitation would harm the normal exploitation of the digital work and
therefore fail the Berne three-step test. The rule of “exhaustion” should therefore only be
applicable to the distribution of tangible properties on material support (a CD or a DVD), as
confirmed by jurisprudence of the CJEU.
- The recent UsedSoft ruling by the CJEU is not a precedent for audiovisual content, which has
a different nature than computer software (i.e. the user licences the use of software for a given
activity, whereas audiovisual works are experience goods as previously explained). As
mentioned by the Commission, “the Court was careful to emphasise that it reached this
decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule
constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive”.


15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of
works and other subject matter?
Today and in general, the clearance of rights in works and other subject matter currently works
sufficiently well among the collecting societies in the different EU-MS. An additional registration



                                                                                                Seite 5
system on EU level could cause unnecessary bureaucracy and additional costs. The question
who has to bare them needs to be clarified. Procedural issues, such as jurisdiction and/or
dispute resolution systems as well as the interplay with collecting societies and the legal status
of, and supervision on, their activities also need to be addressed.


16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
Please see answer to question 15.


17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
Please see answer to question 15.


19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector,
and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions
databases?
The use of identifiers on a voluntary basis is to be welcomed, but it should be recognised that
such mechanisms do not constitute licensing vehicles. Licensing of content should primarily be
left to individual commercial negotiation. There should be no move toward standardisation of
rights ownership and permissions databases on a compulsory basis (except where, e.g. as
today, collective management of rights already is the rule) – their role should be an enabling
one. In those circumstances as referred to as (current or future) exceptions, the potential of
more automated processes should not be prevented from coming to the fore.


20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
Yes. We do not see any justification for terms of protection to be shortened; they have been
and remain an important factor in right holders’ decisions to invest in the funding of creative
works.


21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU
copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
Yes.
Cross border Services (e.g. Cloud Storages) demand a harmonized pan European legal
framework. This applies from a content licensing perspective as well as from a consumer
perspective.
It is important, that the same legal framework exist in order to ensure, that a service, which is
legal in one member state can also be offered in another member state. At the same time this
would help to avoid “forum shopping” in this context.
For all providers of cross border services the same legal and competitive environment has to be
established. Especially concerning the exception for private copying, the different
implementation causes considerable problems in the Single Market. In general it can be said,
that the different systems in the Member States create large obstacles in cross border trade
(e.g. grey market, distortion of competition etc.). Many services, companies and innovators
rely on the existence of specific exceptions and limitations of copyright. Such services cannot
be offered EU wide and a single market is not available to them.



                                                                                                  Seite 6
22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher
level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
Yes. In order to achieve a higher level of harmonization, all limitations and exceptions should
be made mandatory. This is the only way to avoid a fragmentation of the legal framework from
member state to member state.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of
flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
Please see answer to question 21. There should be no flexibility with regard to the member
states in order to avoid a fragmentation of the legal framework from member state to member
state.


26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?
Please see answer 21.


27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-
border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such
compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
We recognize the importance for rightholders to be compensated for using their works and
believe that the concept of ‘fair compensation’ should be addressed at EU level.


37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
E-lending solutions by public libraries are an interesting possibility for consumers to access all
types of content. Due to the specific nature of audiovisual content as an experience good, it is
important to ensure that such offers do not end up being a substitute for the first market (for
instance, by providing adequate technical protection measures; limiting access to a certain
number of simultaneous e-lendings from the library side; limiting the number of works that a
consumer can access at once; providing appropriate compensation to right holders; etc.).


41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other types of
content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
Generally, contractual solutions can sufficiently address the issue, where there is
demonstrable demand. As a general rule, there is no issue regarding clarity over who owns
rights in audiovisual productions: as an example, FMM’s catalogue dates back to the Thames
programs of the 1970s, and even in this case all right holders have been successfully identified.
- Neither a memorandum-of-understanding arrangement nor collective management
organisations are needed as a means of “mass digitisation” of audiovisual collections or
broadcasters’ archives. Neither should be implemented as a means of bypassing the clearance
process with rights holders and the payment of fair remuneration.
- The recently adopted Directive on certain permitted uses of orphan works foresees legal
means to ensure that, where the right holders of certain works cannot be identified, there are
mechanisms ensuring that works are not lost.



                                                                                                 Seite 7
51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
Generally, we do not see any copyright-related obstacles to improve accessibility for disabled
people. However, these measures are costly to implement and we would encourage policy-
makers to create incentives for their implementation.


59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you experienced
problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)
is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that are
publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through
your service to properly identify these works for online use?
Yes.
- This is done on a case-by-case basis. For example, if an actor makes an appearance in a
show / serial and wishes to publish a show reel of his work (including parts of content owned
by the producing brroadcaster), publishing of this content may be allowed.
- In Germany, UFA has its own division for online activities including online video production
(UFA LAB), which operates YouTube channels, Facebook and Twitter accounts. Some of UFA’s
online activities are specifically targeted at youth: the rap talent show “RAPUTATION”
(www.raputation.tv) rewards the best political rap song written and performed by a young
talent; “Your Chance” (www.yourchance.de) is a talent and casting portal which gives young
people (actors, models, musicians, athletes, etc.) a potential entry point into their respective
industry.
- For that reason, the young people in question grant UFA a non-exclusive licence (unlimited
for content and region). This is necessary for showing their material online on YouTube. For the
ten finalists which are part of the talent show, the licence is exclusive so that the best songs
can be promoted exclusively by UFA. It should be noted that “Raputation” is a “pro bono”
project: normally UFA would negotiate exclusive rights, whenever possible, in order to ensure
the recouping of its investment (with an appropriate remuneration package for the artist in
question).


67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to
levies?
Yes, as ensuring transparency for all market participants would avoid competitive disruptions
between market participants and would increase end-user education about copyright
protection. However, the practical implementation of increasing transparency should not be too
burdensome.


68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue levy
payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of
goods or services?
No. At least in Germany trans-border transactions are not an issue.




                                                                                           Seite 8
69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural persons for
purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue
payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of products, type of transaction,
stakeholders, etc.).
With regard to the German implementation there is no problem with transactions resulting in
undue payments.


70. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what extent
could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States
help to remedy the situation?
71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system, how
would these problems best be solved?
A specific problem under German law is the system how the respective tariffs are determined.
Under the current system it occasionally takes years until a certain tariff is finally fixed.
Meanwhile all relevant parties need to deal with the uncertainness with regard to pricing and
accounting. Therefore, a tariff system setting up a fixed process how tariffs are determined in
terms of scope of application and precise amount would lead to more clarity.


78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing
a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single
framework for enforcement?
No.
