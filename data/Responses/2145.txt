Response of the Library Copyright Alliance to the EU Copyright Consultation

        The Library Copyright Alliance (LCA) consists of three major library
associations—the American Library Association, the Association of College and
Research Libraries, and the Association of Research Libraries—that collectively
represent over 100,000 libraries in the United States employing over 350,000
librarians and other personnel. LCA submits this statement to the European
Union drawing on the experiences of libraries in the United States and Canada.
LCA takes an active interest in the copyright policies that affect the work of
libraries, including those of the European Union. Furthermore, the Internet age
requires entities, such as libraries, to operate globally, and LCA is therefore
interested in the EU’s Public Consultation on the Review of EU Copyright Rules.
Our response focuses on those questions that are most pertinent to the library
community.

Digital Transmissions

#11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

       LCA does not recommend that the provision of a hyperlink should be
subject to the authorization of the rightholder. Hyperlinks are an essential part
of the way the Internet functions, can provide easy access to online resources and
information, and are increasingly used in social media. The Internet cannot
function as an information and communications tool if users do not have a way
to find specific information and cannot turn to additional information provided
by hyperlinks that can validate the credibility of the content or directs a user to
related documents. This absurdity is akin to eliminating indexes and
bibliographic citations in print publications. Requiring a person to obtain the
permission of the rightholder each time a hyperlink is provided would create a
massive chilling effect, particularly regarding free speech for website owners,
search engines, bloggers and anyone who shares links.

        Libraries often depend on the ability to provide links to online resources
to its users as part of their core mission to promote access to information, foster
the exchange of ideas and expertise, and transmit and create knowledge. Links
can be used to aid patrons in research and providing access to information only
available online. Subjecting hyperlinking to the authorization of the rightholder
would greatly impede the sharing of knowledge and information and there is no
public policy justification for instituting such a practice.

#12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on
the screen and in the cache memory of the user's computer, either in general or
under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?

        The viewing of a web page should not be subject to the authorization of
the rightholder. Through the basic functioning of the Internet and computers,
the viewing of a web page implies the temporary reproduction of the work in the
computer’s (or other device) random access memory (RAM), and generally also
in the cache memory. Requiring the authorization of a rightholder simply to
view a webpage would negatively impact the ease of access to information that
the Internet provides, without providing any meaningful benefit to rightholders.
Presumably, information placed on a webpage exists for users to access and
requiring authorization from a rightholder merely to view a webpage would
essentially create a legal trap for the user engaged in behavior he has every
reason to believe is legal.

#13. Have you faced restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you
have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

       Libraries typically license digital materials, and these licenses usually limit
the ability of libraries to make preservation copies, permanently transfer
possession of the files to third parties, and resell purchased content. An
important issue the EU should consider with respect to libraries in particular and
licensees more generally is the extent to which statutory limitations to copyright
should survive contractual restrictions on the exercise of those limitations.
“Contracting out” is already under review in several EU member states, and goes
to the heart of the nature of copyright in the 21 century. As will be discussed in                                                                                                                                                     st



more detail in response to question 23, we note also that the Australian Law
Reform Commission (ALRC) recently recommended a prohibition against
contracting out of exceptions to copyright law for libraries and archives.1	  

Term of Protection

#20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
digital environment?

        A copyright term of life of the author plus seventy years, or for a work-
for-hire, seventy years from publication, is inappropriate particularly in the
digital age. Lengthy copyright terms result in the loss of access to numerous
copyrighted works as many works fall out of use, are not commercialized, and
subsequently vanish. Excessive copyright terms contribute to increased costs of
access to knowledge, greater resources required to search for authors, an
increased number of “orphan” works, the loss of works before they can be

(Nov. 2013).


	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 2
archived, and the inability to create derivative works during the extended period
of protection.

       In the UK-commissioned independent report by Ian Hargreaves released
in 2011, economic evidence does not support longer copyright terms:

                   Economic evidence is clear that the likely deadweight loss to the
                   economy exceeds any additional incentivising effect which might
                   result from the extension of copyright term beyond its present
                   levels. This is doubly clear for retrospective extension to copyright
                   term, given the impossibility of incentivising the creation of already
                   existing works, or work from artists already dead. Despite this,
                   there are frequent proposals to increase term . . . The UK
                   Government assessment found it to be economically detrimental.
                   An international study found term extension to have no impact on
                   output.2

        In the digital environment where works are often published on the
Internet, content is increasingly ephemeral in nature. In the digital age, it is
faster and easier to create and share information and content, much of which the
copyright owner may wish to share and disseminate widely. Such content may
have little or no economic value to the copyright owner, but nevertheless
remains under copyright protection until seventy years after the author’s death.
Furthermore, websites and blogs may disappear overnight and the content
contained therein lost forever unless appropriate steps are taken to archive and
preserve this information. As will be discussed in further detail in response to
questions 28(a) and 30, website archiving is important in preserving cultural and
historical information.

Limitations and Exceptions

#23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from
the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

       As will be discussed in further detail in the following two questions, the
EU should adopt a flexible fair use provision in order to address areas where
specific limitations and exceptions do not exist.

                                                      In addition, we note that contracts should not restrict or diminish the
scope of limitations and exceptions for libraries. The Australian Law Reform
Commission (ALRC) recently released a report with a number of
recommendations, one of which would prohibit contracting out of exceptions to
copyright law for libraries and archives.3 The ALRC explicitly “recommends
that the Copyright Act should be amended to provide contractual terms
restricting or preventing the doing of any act which would otherwise be

permitted by the libraries and archives exceptions are unenforceable.” The EU
should similarly consider such a provision to ensure that limitations and
exceptions—whether these refer to specific exceptions or a flexible fair use
provision—are fully available to libraries and not restricted by contractual terms.

#24. Independently, from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a
greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations
and exceptions?

       Yes. A more flexible approach is recommended to allow for additional
limitations and exceptions that are not addressed in the restrictive closed-list
system under Article 5 of the EU Copyright Directive. Greater flexibility allows
the copyright system to adapt to new issues and technologies that arise.

#25. If yes (to question 24), what would be the best approach to provide for
flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic
revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in
flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm,
etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the
functioning of the Internal Market.

       A more flexible approach to limitations and exceptions has been an
important component in promoting balance in the copyright system in the
United States. It is impossible to conceive of every limitation and exception
necessary to achieve an appropriate balance, and the flexibility of a “fair use”
system can address areas where specific limitations and exceptions do not reach.
Another advantage of the fair use system is that it can address new technologies
and issues that arise without necessitating revisions to copyright law. A flexible
statutory provision interpreted by the courts allows decisions to be made on a
case-by-case basis. Closed list systems, by contrast, are slow to address the
evolution of technologies or accommodate new ideas.

      Fair use in the United States is codified under Section 107 of the Copyright
Act and provides:

       Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 17 U.S.C. § 106 and 17
       U.S.C. § 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use
       by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means
       specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment,
       news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom
       use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In
       determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case
       is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—

          1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such
             use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational
             purposes;
          2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

                                                                                  3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation
                                                                                     to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
                                                                                  4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of
                                                                                     the copyrighted work.

                                                      The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of
                                                      fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above
                                                      factors.

This provision provides a non-exhaustive list of uses that may be considered fair
and four statutory factors for a court to evaluate in determining whether the
defense of fair use applies in a given context.

       Fair use in the United States has also allowed the growth of new
industries and responded to the creation of new technologies. While the law can
be slow to catch up to emerging technologies, a flexible fair use system allows
the copyright system to grow and evolve.

        With respect to libraries, fair use has been a critical component in
supporting key functions and serving the public. Although United States law
contains specific limitations and exceptions for libraries, fair use remains an
important component of the copyright system that has permitted libraries to
achieve their missions by providing service in a number of areas including
collecting and curating; preserving; lending and provision of information;
indexing and retrieving information; facilitating research and education; and
providing access to users with print disabilities. For more detailed information
on how libraries in the United States rely on fair use, see the white paper, How
Flexibility Supports the Goals of Copyright Law: Fair Use and the U.S. Library
Experience (2013).4

       Numerous libraries have adopted similar practices in applying fair use to
their activities. Such consensus may be considered best practices for the library
community and eight sets of common current practices are summarized in ARL’s
Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and Research Libraries.5 These
practices include 1) supporting teaching and learning with access to library
materials via digital technologies; 2) using selections from collection materials to
publicize a library’s activities, or to create physical and virtual exhibitions; 3)
digitizing to preserve at-risk items; 4) creating digital collections of archival and
special collections materials; 5) reproducing material for use by disabled
students, faculty, staff and other appropriate users; 6) maintaining the integrity
of works deposited in institutional repositories; 7) creating databases to facilitate

non-consumptive research uses (including search); and 8) collecting material
posted on the World Wide Web and making it available.

        In addition to facilitating the activities addressed in these best practices,
fair use has supplied an important legal basis for libraries in other areas, for
example for the digital preservation and provision of tailored access programs
for orphan works. Without libraries relying on fair use, the public risks the loss
of these works. Libraries in the United States hold a large collection of orphan
works, with some studies finding that up to 55 percent of research libraries’
collections in the United States are orphan works. As an equitable doctrine, fair                                                                                                                                                      6



use is particularly well-suited to providing access to orphan works for non-
commercial purposes.

       The United States is not unique in adopting a flexible approach to
limitations and exceptions. As noted in Jonathan Band and Jonathan Gerafi’s,
The Fair Use/Fair Dealing Handbook, over forty countries have a fair dealing or fair
use provision in their copyright laws.7 Ample case law and examples of the way
fair use and fair dealing have been implemented exist in these jurisdictions. The                                                                                                                                                          8



availability of this precedent should dispel any concerns that courts in a country
that adopts a fair use/fair dealing provision would not have sufficient guidance
to apply it. In fact, when the Australian Law Reform Commission recently
recommended the adoption of a flexible fair use provision which “can adapt to
new technologies and services” and “facilitate[ ] the public interest in accessing
material, encourag[e] new productive uses, and stimulat[e] competition and
innovation,” it addressed concerns raised regarding potential uncertainty in
implementing fair use. Responding to such concerns, the ALRC noted:

                                                      Although standards are generally less certain in scope than detailed
                                                      rules, a clear principled standard is more certain than an unclear
                                                      complex rule. The Report recommends replacing many complex
                                                      prescriptive exceptions with one clear and more certain standard—
                                                      fair use.

                                                      The standard recommended by the ALRC is not novel or untested.
                                                      Fair use builds on Australia’s fair dealing exceptions, it has been
                                                      applied in US courts for decades, and it is built on common law
                                                      copyright principles that date back to the eighteenth century. If fair
                                                      use is uncertain, this does not seem to have generally inhibited the
                                                      creation of films, music, books and other material in the world’s

A flexible approach to limitations and exceptions is not unique to the United
States and fair use is gaining support in more countries. The ALRC pointed out
that “Almost 30 existing exceptions could be repealed, if fair use were enacted . .
. Replacing so many exceptions with a single fairness exception will make the
Copyright Act considerably more clear, coherent and principled.” The fair use
recommendation by the ALRC would incorporate the four fair use factors and
also provide a non-exhaustive list of illustrative purposes that would include,
among others, research or study as well as library or archive use.

       We recommend that the EU adopt a flexible fair use/fair dealing
provision. In examining the contours of such a provision and evaluating the
advantages of a flexible fair use system, the EU should consider the information
contained in the following documents:

Access to content in libraries and archives: Preservation and archiving

#28(a). [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive
specific works or other subject matter in your collection?

       In the digital age, a growing number of works and information are made
available over the Internet. Due to the ephemeral nature of information posted
on the Internet, however, such content can easily be lost. Website archiving thus
serves an important function in preserving cultural and historical information.
As noted in the 2013 white paper, How Flexibility Supports the Goals of Copyright
Law: Fair Use and the U.S. Library Experience, “Web archiving—the practice of
copying and archiving entire websites-facilitates the ongoing discovery and use
of culturally valuable information, essential for building the documentary record
of many fields of research.”10	   Archived materials can also reach a wider
audience:

	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 7
                                                      Material posted to the Internet typically serves a time-limited
                                                      purpose and targets a distinct network of users, while its library-
                                                      held counterpart will document the site for a wide variety of
                                                      patrons over time . . . Preserving such work can also be considered
                                                      strongly transformative in itself, separate from any way that future
                                                      patrons may access it. Authors of online materials often have a
                                                      specific objective and a particular audience in mind; libraries that
                                                      collect this material serve a different and broader purpose and a
                                                      different and broader network of users. Libraries collect not only
                                                      for a wide range of purposes today, but also for unanticipated uses
                                                      by future researchers.11

        In the United States context, while no specific limitation or exception
exists to permit web archiving, libraries and archives may rely on the flexible fair
use provision to perform such functions. Indeed, courts in the United States
have provided a legal basis to suggest that library website archiving is
transformative for the purposes of fair use.12 As noted in response to question
25, supra, we recommend that the EU adopt a flexible fair use approach that
would permit libraries to address new preservation and archival issues that arise
as technology evolves. Without a flexible fair use approach or specific
limitations and exceptions to permit libraries to archive websites, the threat of
copyright liability may cause the loss of important cultural and historic
information.

       A flexible fair use provision would also be useful in preserving materials
other than websites. Although sections 108(b) and (c) of the U.S. Copyright Act
contain specific exceptions for library preservation of unpublished and published
materials, we have found fair use to be an important supplement to section 108.

#29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

        The problem of website archiving may be resolved through a specific
limitation and exception expressly permitting archiving or through a more
flexible fair use approach such as the on detailed in response to question 25,
supra, or both. The benefit of including a flexible fair use provision allows the
copyright law to evolve as technologies change and new issues emerge. We
recommend that in determining how to address the issue of website archiving
that the EU consider the following documents:

#30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its
main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institution should be
covered and under which conditions?

       The EU should consider adopting a flexible fair use approach as detailed
in question 25, supra. As noted, the rapidly evolving digital age makes it
difficult to create specific, appropriate, and adequate limitations and exceptions
to copyright that will serve to address new technologies that may arise ten,
twenty or fifty years from now. In considering how a fair use standard would
apply to website archiving, ARL’s Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic
and Research Libraries provides guidance:

           PRINCIPLE:
           It is fair use to create topically based collections of websites and
           other material from the Internet and to make them available for
           scholarly use.

           LIMITATIONS:
              • Captured material should be represented as it was captured,
                with appropriate information on mode of harvesting and
                date.
              • To the extent reasonably possible, the legal proprietors of the
                sites in question should be identified according to the
                prevailing conventions of attribution.
              • Libraries should provide copyright owners with a simple tool
                for registering objections to making items from such a
                collection available online, and respond to such objections
                promptly. !

           ENHANCEMENTS:
             • Claims of fair use relating to material posted with “bot
               exclusion” headers to ward off automatic harvesting may be
               stronger when the institution has adopted and follows a
               consistent policy on this issue, taking into account the
               possible rationales for collecting Internet material and the
               nature of the material in question.
             • The more comprehensive a collection of web impressions in
               a given topic area is, the more persuasively the inclusion of
               any given item can be characterized as fair use.

Access to content in libraries and archives: Off-premises access to library
collections

#32(a). [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that
enable you to provide remote access, including across borders, to your
collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of research and study?

For materials owned by libraries in the United States, libraries can provide access
to users in accordance with Section 107 (fair use) and Section 108 (specific
limitations for libraries and archives) of the Copyright Act. However, for
licensed materials, libraries can only provide access as permitted under the terms
of the license. Some licenses allow for remote access to authorized users, such as
faculty members and students of the university. Specific license terms are often
determined on a license-by-license basis and libraries in the United States have
experienced problems with international interlibrary loans.

Access to content in libraries and archives: E-lending

#36(a). [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending
(e-lending), including across borders, of books or other materials held in your
collection?

        In the United States experience, digital works may be encumbered by
licenses which may restrict a library’s lending practices, including for inter-
library loans. In public libraries, licenses may restrict the e-lending of books
within regional networks and in consortiums. Similarly, academic and research
libraries have faced difficulties in negotiating agreements to enable the electronic
lending of whole books through inter-library loans, with many agreements
restricting e-lending to single chapters. Acquired digital works should have the
same status as those in analog form and licenses attached to electronic copies can
hamper the ability to lend digital materials.

Access to content in libraries and archives: Mass digitisation

#40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to
engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management
organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to
ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between
libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of
commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

       Digitization efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives have
largely been made possible through reliance on fair use. Libraries rely on fair
use to support digitization of works in their collections and to support the use of
large-scale shared digital repositories for particular purposes. For example, the
HathiTrust Digital Library contains millions of scanned works from over sixty


	                                       10
partner institutions. The court decision in Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust, held                                                                                                                                           13



that digitizing the works was fair use when done for the purposes of creating
full-text searches, preservation, and providing access to users with disabilities.
Each of these activities standing alone, the court ruled, are fair use. In the
absence of specific limitations and exceptions covering a particular use, the
flexibility of fair use allows for important public interest uses such as mass
digitization. Depending on licensing alone for mass digitization would be
inefficient, fail to cover the numerous “orphan works” and result in the loss of
invaluable historical and cultural documents.

Teaching

#42(a). [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user]:
Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which
works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for teaching, including
across borders?

       As noted in response to question 25, supra, fair use has played an
important role in overcoming specific problems, including those that result from
the way in which works are used for illustration for teaching. While the United
States has specific limitations and exceptions for distance education, codified by
the TEACH Act, 17 U.S.C. 110(2), the detailed list of conditions, prohibitions, and
exclusions can provide a barrier and may not cover every specific educational
context. Fair use provides a complement to specific limitations and exceptions,
and the flexibility permits the copyright system to grow and adapt. For example,
as noted in How Flexibility Supports the Goals of Copyright Law: Fair Use and the U.S.
Library Experience:

                    libraries may rely on fair use where purpose-specific exceptions do
                    not clearly cover a specific educational context. U.S. libraries’
                    experience with facilitating distance education offers an example of
                    how flexibility can complement purpose-specific exceptions that
                    may be impractical in a given context. Libraries’ continued reliance
                    on fair use to support distance education—even after the passage of
                    the TEACH Act, a purpose- specific exception intended for distance
                    education—exemplifies this point.

                                                      The 2002 TEACH Act was intended to update U.S. copyright law to
                                                      allow exceptions for distance education beyond face-to-face
                                                      classroom instruction given advances in technology. However, the
                                                      revisions require that institutions meet a series of complex pre-
                                                      requisites to exercise the exception, including the use of technical
                                                      protection measures on materials used in distance education, and
                                                      do not account for the recent rapid growth of online education.
                                                      Further the pre-requisites under the Act can be interpreted in either
                                                      strict or more lenient ways, and no court rulings to date provide
                                                      guidance to libraries.

                                                      their institutional information technology strategies— continue to
                                                      rely on fair use, which is unaffected by the Act. Instead, libraries
                                                      can incorporate elements from the Act, such as using password
                                                      protections to limit access and placing warning signs on
                                                      copyrighted material, to strengthen their position that these
                                                      activities are fair use in supporting distance education.                                                                                                                         14




       In the educational context, fair use has provided sufficient flexibility to
address new issues and technologies, allowing for multiple important uses that
might otherwise be prohibited if only a closed-list system of limitations and
exceptions existed. For example, with respect to electronic-reserves, a district
court held in Cambridge University Press v. Becker (“Georgia State University
case”) that the libraries correctly applied fair use in digitizing works for
educational use, among other purposes, in ninety-four out of ninety-nine alleged
infringements. There, Georgia State University made excerpts from academic
books available online to students enrolled in particular courses. At the
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the school streamed creative
audiovisual works to enrolled students; the court in that case found that fair use
applied in this context. In both cases, the non-profit, educational purpose of
Georgia State University and UCLA’s uses were found to favor fair use.

Research

#47(a). [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:]
Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other
subject matter in the context of research projects/activities including across
borders?

        As noted in response to question 25, supra, fair use has played a critical
role in allowing libraries to serve their patrons and fulfill their mission. With
respect to research projects, libraries in the United States have successfully relied
on fair use to create databases that enhance and transform research uses. ARL’s
Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and Research Libraries, for example,
provides guidance as to how libraries rely on fair use to facilitate non-
consumptive research uses, including text mining, digitizing and indexing
works:

       PRINCIPLE:
       It is fair use for libraries to develop and facilitate the development
       of digital databases of collection items to enable nonconsumptive
       analysis across the collection for both scholarly and reference
       purposes.

       LIMITATION:
       • Items in copyright digitized for nonconsumptive uses should not
       be employed in other ways (e.g., to provide digital access for
       ordinary reading) without independent justification, either by a
       license from the rights holder or pursuant to a statutory exception.
       Search access to database materials should be limited to portions
       appropriate to the nonconsumptive research purpose.

       ENHANCEMENTS:
       • The case for fair use will be at its strongest when the database
       includes information such as rich metadata that augments the
       research or reference value of its contents.
       • Assertions of fair use will be particularly persuasive when
       libraries cooperate with other institutions to build collective
       databases that enable more extensive scholarship or reference
       searching.

Disabilities

#51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

       The EU should ratify the Marrakesh Treaty and ensure that it is
implemented in all member states in order to address the significant problems
persons with disabilities face regarding access to learning materials, research,
and general information. Cross-border sharing of accessible content would help
address “the book famine,” particularly in developing countries where access to
accessible content is estimated to be less than one percent of currently published
materials.
