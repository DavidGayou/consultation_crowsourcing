Rights and functioning in the Single Market




Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere
in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced  problems
   when trying to access online services in an EU Member  State  other  than
   the one in which you live?


( NO.

We regret the biased nature of  this  question  –  surely  a  more  relevant
question to start the public consultation would be  to  seek  input  on  the
range, quality and attractiveness of the more than 3000  services  currently
available in the European Union[1].  The offer of  online  content  services
at national level is plentiful and in our experience,  for  example  in  the
context of cable and satellite services,  European  consumers  favour  their
national content options first.

Film and audiovisual content is fundamentally different from other types  of
creative content, both from a  consumer  perspective  and  from  a  business
perspective.   It  is  well  documented  that  the  consumption  pattern  of
audiovisual content online in any national European  culture  today  broadly
replicates the  patterns  seen  with  legacy  media  such  as  cinema,  home
entertainment on digital media  and  linear  television:  roughly  speaking,
consumer preference is for  national  content  first,  international  non-EU
blockbusters second, and anything  else  third,  including  non-national  EU
content.

In addition, a full understanding of the interlinked business  relationships
which underpin the European audiovisual  industry’s  financing,  production,
marketing and distribution practices  is  critical  to  the  development  of
appropriate future policies and  legislation  in  this  area.   Unlike  many
manufactured goods, film escapes standardisation and each film is  a  unique
work, a prototype – each film  has  its  own  business  model  in  terms  of
financing, production  and  distribution.   Given  the  level  of  financial
investment required  in  film  and  audiovisual  production,  marketing  and
distribution,  most  European  audiovisual  entities  seek  to   share,   or
outsource, the financial risk involved in film production and  distribution.
 This  is  often  done  by  pre-selling  distribution  rights  by  platform,
language  and/or  territory  to  entities  specialised  in   marketing   and
distributing audiovisual content in the various  exploitation  channels  and
countries.  This system serves as an elaborate form  of  “peer-review”,  and
investment  partners  are  attracted  by  the  sheer  creative   force   and
commercial potential of the audiovisual  project.   Indeed,  in  many  cases
this process takes place even before the actual production/shooting  of  the
film.

For further substantiation of the indispensable role  in  the  financing  of
European  films  played  by  pre-sales  of  future  distribution  rights  by
distribution channel and linguistic versions, see the evidence submitted  to
the Licences for Europe Stakeholder Dialogue, Working Group  1[2].   In  the
case studies presented by FIAPF/IFTA/IVF,  the  contribution  to  the  total
film production budget from pre-sales  ranges  from  31  to  66  %[3].   The
contractual freedom to organise the financing  and  future  distribution  of
each film in accordance with its specific business model makes  it  possible
to finance European films and ensure their best possible  promotion  to  the
future audience in each individual market.

As evidenced by the  EU  MEDIA/Creative  Europe  programme,  European  films
often find it difficult to find an audience  beyond  their  national  market
and therefore require local, specialised marketing and distribution  efforts
tailored  to  the  specific  distribution  channel  and   targeted   foreign
audience. The  current  copyright  system  provides  no  legal  barriers  to
offering services covering several territories.   But  many  elements  other
than  copyright  play  a  role  in  the  degree  of  development  of  online
audiovisual services and their  availability  in  different  Member  States:
relevant  hardware  penetration,   broadband   infrastructure   and   speed,
taxation, micro-payment facilities, rules on  protection  of  consumers  and
minors.  The degree of availability of illegal  content  and  services  also
plays an  important  role  in  the  development  of  a  strong,  sustainable
audiovisual online offer.

Our  members  are  increasingly  pursuing  new  opportunities  presented  by
technological developments and convergence, be it  by  offering  audiovisual
works online directly to end users or in  cooperation  with  third  parties.
These services are bringing greater choice to consumers, both  in  terms  of
content on offer and in the variety of platforms  and  ways  to  access  and
consume audiovisual content. We  are  seeing  rapid  growth  in  the  online
market for audiovisual works in Europe, with consumer  spending  on  digital
online video increasing by a  phenomenal  97.1%  in  2012  compared  to  the
previous year[4]. Given  the  challenging  economic  circumstances  for  the
European audiovisual sector, these new revenue streams are clearly  welcome.
However, the gains in revenue from digital online video are not yet able  to
compensate for the continued reduction in revenue from  the  physical  video
market.  Annual consumer spending on physical video  is  estimated  to  have
contracted by over €3600m compared to pre-crisis  levels,  whereas  European
consumer spending on digital online video amounted to  just  a  fraction  of
this in 2012, at €673.7m[5].  These fluctuations in revenue  streams  affect
our members’ capacity to finance, produce and  disseminate  new  audiovisual
content: less funds are available to pre-purchase  future  video  publishing
rights (offline and online) prior to the actual making  of  the  film,  thus
affecting producers’ ability to close production budgets. There  is  also  a
negative effect on revenues flowing back into production,  distribution  and
publishing activities.

Our members do not consider online distribution of  audiovisual  content  to
be merely a potential  future  revenue  stream  or  as  a  way  to  amortise
investments.  They are  increasingly  looking  to  new  online  distribution
channels to contribute to the advance financing  of  films  and  audiovisual
content in a manner similar to that already  provided  by  the  pre-sale  of
rights  to  theatrical,  home  entertainment  and  television   distribution
channels.   In  other  words,  they  are  looking  to  online   distribution
platforms and services  to  share  in  the  financial  risk  of  production,
marketing and distribution.  This is  a  strategic  necessity  in  order  to
ensure that the widest possible choice in terms  of  platforms,  titles  and
price points is offered to consumers.

Our  members  continue  to  invest  in  and  experiment  with   the   online
distribution of audiovisual content.  At present, many  different  varieties
of  models,  content  and  delivery  modes  are  being  explored  by  market
operators in the European Union and it remains to be  seen  which  modes  of
consumption will be favoured by consumers going forward.

Empirical observations of the companies active in our  sector  (often  SMEs)
suggest that the obstacles to  developing  an  EU-wide  presence  have  very
little to do with legal infrastructure. Rather, these obstacles are  due  to
the rich cultural and linguistic diversity  of  Europe  and  the  particular
economic model dictated by a European market made up of multiple  languages,
cultures, local tastes and societal  preoccupations.   In  addition,  strong
regional  differences  in  terms  of  broadband  infrastructure,  speed  and
preferred payment systems create further barriers which  any  market  player
would need to overcome in order to build a successful  EU-wide  presence  in
the online environment.


2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have  you  faced  problems
   when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


( NO.  The issue is one of lack of actual, sustainable consumer  demand  for
cross border services.  Consumer demand focuses on access  to  content,  not
platforms.  At present, commercial demand for  licences  to  provide  online
services across borders is negligible.  Platforms and aggregators appear  to
focus on national or regional markets, assessing these to be  the  pertinent
markets, at least at this stage of market development.


3. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
   organisation:]  How  often  are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
   licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests  per  year
   and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type
   of content concerned.


As mentioned above, actual  demand  for  cross-border  or  multi-territorial
licences  is  extremely  limited   at   this   stage,   especially   outside
linguistically connected  countries/regions.   Successful  online  licensing
and distribution of audiovisual content depends on offering a wide range  of
attractive  content  in  a  manner  which  is  linguistically  relevant  and
culturally attractive to local audiences.  Thus, platforms  and  aggregators
appear to focus on national or regional markets, assessing these to  be  the
pertinent markets, at least at this stage of market development.


4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any  of  the  questions
   above – what would be the best way to tackle them?

N/A


5. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
   organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where  you  hold  all
   the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still
   find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on  a
   service provider (in order,  for  instance,  to  ensure  that  access  to
   certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?


( YES – As set out  above,  there  are  objective  reasons  for  territorial
licensing.  First and foremost, this is the most efficient  way  to  respond
to local demand which  tends  towards  national  content  first  and  non-EU
and/or non-national content second,  with  language  playing  a  significant
role.  Second,  market  and  regulatory  conditions  vary  from  country  to
country, de-facto imposing territorial licensing in  certain  circumstances.
In  addition,  European  audiovisual  content  is  predominantly   financed,
produced and disseminated  in  models  of  joint  ventures  (co-productions)
and/or risk-sharing between partners from different  distribution  platforms
and/or territories.

Unlike many manufactured goods, film escapes standardisation and  each  film
is a unique work, a prototype – each film has  its  own  business  model  in
terms of  financing,  production  and  distribution.   Given  the  level  of
financial investment required in film and audiovisual production,  marketing
and distribution, most European  audiovisual  entities  seek  to  share,  or
outsource, the financial risk involved in film production and  distribution.
 This  is  often  done  by  pre-selling  distribution  rights  by  platform,
language  and/or  territory  to  entities  specialised  in   marketing   and
distributing audiovisual content in the various  exploitation  channels  and
countries.  This system serves as an elaborate form  of  “peer-review”,  and
investment  partners  are  attracted  by  the  sheer  creative   force   and
commercial potential of the audiovisual project.   Indeed,  in  many  cases,
this process takes place even before the actual production/shooting  of  the
film.

For further substantiation of the indispensable role  in  the  financing  of
European  films  played  by  pre-sales  of  future  distribution  rights  by
distribution channel and linguistic versions, see the evidence submitted  to
the Licences for Europe Stakeholder Dialogue, Working Group  1[6].   In  the
case studies presented by FIAPF/IFTA/IVF,  the  contribution  to  the  total
film production budget from pre-sales  ranges  from  31  to  66  %[7].   The
contractual freedom to organise the financing  and  future  distribution  of
each film in accordance with its specific business model makes  it  possible
to finance European films and ensure their best possible  promotion  to  the
future audience in each individual market.

There is currently no other way in which the  required  level  of  financing
can be raised in the marketplace.


6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:]  Are
   there reasons why,  even  in  cases  where  you  have  acquired  all  the
   necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would  still
   find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on  the
   service recipient (in order for instance, to  redirect  the  consumer  to
   a different website than the one he is trying to access)?





( N/A


7. Do you think  that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
   including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level  to  increase  the
   cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
   ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


( NO - In the absence of evidence of market  failure,  there  should  be  no
legislative or policy intervention in the audiovisual industry’s  commercial
and contractual  freedom  with  regard  to  territoriality  and  exclusivity
provisions.  Imposed business  models  and  distribution  practices  do  not
promote a sustainable audiovisual industry.  The industry needs to  be  able
to adapt – without legislative intervention –  to  changing  commercial  and
market conditions.  Where there is  demonstrable  and  sustainable  consumer
demand, the market will respond.

As evidenced by the  EU  MEDIA/Creative  Europe  programme,  European  films
often find it difficult to find an audience  beyond  their  national  market
and therefore require local, specialised marketing and distribution  efforts
tailored  to  the  specific  distribution  channel  and   targeted   foreign
audience. The  current  copyright  system  provides  no  legal  barriers  to
offering services covering several territories.   But  many  elements  other
than  copyright  play  a  role  in  the  degree  of  development  of  online
audiovisual services and their  availability  in  different  Member  States:
relevant  hardware  penetration,   broadband   infrastructure   and   speed,
taxation, micro-payment facilities, rules on  protection  of  consumers  and
minors.  The degree of availability of illegal  content  and  services  also
plays an  important  role  in  the  development  of  a  strong,  sustainable
audiovisual online offer.



Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?



[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]

   1. The act of “making available”



8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in  cross-border  situations
   – i.e. when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


( YES

The exclusive right of  “making  available”,  as  established  by  the  WIPO
Copyright Treaty and implemented in the EU by  the  Copyright  Directive[8],
extends to  the  offering  to  the  public  of  a  work  for  individualized
streaming or downloading as well as the actual transmission  of  a  work  to
members of the public – from a place and at a time  individually  chosen  by
them, irrespective of the technical means used  for  making  available.  The
very nature of the making available right for copyright works is  such  that
it takes place both where it is offered and where it  is  capable  of  being
accessed by consumers. This is a reflection of  the  interactive  nature  of
the right. This is crucial both to the licensing  of  content  but  also  to
determining the jurisdiction and/or the applicable law for right holders  to
enforce their rights against infringers and online intermediaries.

Recent  jurisprudence  of  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union
(CJEU)[9] has provided helpful clarification of  the  scope  of  the  making
available right.  In fact, our members rely on the  making  available  right
on a daily basis as a tool for licensing  their  content  on  the  basis  of
different distribution channels, linguistic versions, etc.  They  also  rely
on the making available right to enforce their rights online.

Any approach to the making available right  that  would  artificially  alter
the inherent interactive nature of this right  would  risk  undermining  its
utility as a licensing and enforcement tool.  Indeed, a limitation, such  as
through the so-called “country of origin” approach, of  the  scope  of  this
exclusive right would seriously diminish its value and therefore  amount  to
an expropriation of a valuable property right  protected  as  a  fundamental
right by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as well  as
international copyright treaties.   Finally, any limitation on scope of  the
exercise of exclusive rights must also meet the conditions enshrined in  the
three-step step pursuant to international copyright treaties.


9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification  of  the
   territorial scope of the “making available” right have an effect  on  the
   recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you  are  considered  to  be  an
   author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights
   or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including
   the availability of injunctive relief)?


( YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

As noted above, a  “clarification”  limiting  the  scope  of  the  exclusive
making available right is neither necessary nor justified.

In the audiovisual sector, the rights  necessary  to  finance,  produce  and
exploit a film or TV programme are generally consolidated with the  producer
– the question of who is considered to be among the authors of the  film  as
well as how remuneration is organised is dealt with by national  law  and/or
practices.  The exercising of the making  available  right  does  not  raise
issues in this connection.  However, it is  crucial  that  the  producer  be
able – through commercial and contractual freedom – to manage and  authorise
the distribution of the work concerned, including the  distribution  channel
and the territorial scope of the rights  licensed,  in  the  optimal  manner
both in terms of the exploitation  of  the  work  itself  and  also  to  the
benefit of all right  holders  in  the  collaborative  work.   As  mentioned
above, this  commercial  and  contractual  freedom  is  fundamental  to  the
European film industry’s financing model.  European  film  makers,  be  they
producers or authors, need to secure financing prior to the shooting of  the
actual film.

For further substantiation of the indispensable role  in  the  financing  of
European  films  played  by  pre-sales  of  future  distribution  rights  by
distribution channel and linguistic versions, see the evidence submitted  to
the Licences for Europe Stakeholder Dialogue, Working Group 1[10].   In  the
case studies presented by FIAPF/IFTA/IVF,  the  contribution  to  the  total
film production budget from pre-sales ranges  from  31  to  66  %[11].   The
contractual freedom to organise the financing  and  future  distribution  of
each film in accordance with its specific business model makes  it  possible
to finance European films and ensure their best possible  promotion  to  the
future audience in each individual market.

As regards enforcement, a  “country  of  origin”  approach  could  seriously
hamper right holders’ ability to take legal action to  address  structurally
infringing websites which are based in other Member  States  or  outside  of
the EU itself (note that the operators of such sites are  usually  anonymous
and thus cannot be identified or located).  As a  result,  legal  action  in
the form of proceedings for  injunctive  relief  is  generally  directed  at
intermediaries based on Article 8(3) of the Copyright Directive.  There  are
two important conditions which must be fulfilled before a  court  will  have
jurisdiction to rule under this provision (1) the subject of  the  order  is
an intermediary (a very broad notion which includes access  providers);  and
(2) a third party uses the  intermediary’s  service  to  infringe.   Once  a
court has established that these criteria are met,  it  will  then  consider
issues  related  to  proportionality,  freedom  of  expression   and   other
fundamental rights.

Article 8(3) has become a crucial tool for right  holders  to  fight  online
copyright infringements – particularly due to  the  fact  that  structurally
infringing sites rarely operate openly in the EU (see the AG Opinion in  the
kino.to case[12]). With respect to peer-to-peer sites, the  nature  of  such
sites is that the access provider’s subscribers  (end-users)  will  use  its
services to infringe (since they are uploading  and  downloading  infringing
content) and the structurally-infringing peer-to-peer site,  which  will  be
operating  offshore  and  anonymously,  will  also  be  using   the   access
provider’s service to infringe (since  it  is  making  available  infringing
content).  If the making available right were to be subject to  the  country
of origin doctrine, it could be  difficult  to  show  that  the  website  is
infringing copyright in another country where the  injunction  is  sought  –
but the damage is nevertheless significant –  and therefore meets the  above
stated condition, i.e. that the site is using the intermediary’s service  to
infringe.   While  action  could  still  be  based   on   the   subscriber’s
infringements, right holders would find their options and scope  for  action
against infringing activities seriously limited.

As regards streaming sites, it would become  much  more  difficult  to  show
that the end user is infringing (right holders would have  to  invoke  their
reproduction right  and  issues  related  to  the  possible  exceptions  for
temporary and private copies would arise – both issues are currently  before
the CJEU.  The potential impact of a  limitation  on  the  making  available
right is thus more pronounced.

   2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation



10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right  holder:]  Does  the
   application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the
   online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


( NO

It is not unusual for a single  act  of  economic  exploitation  to  involve
several rights.

On-demand services  generally  implicate  the  making  available  right  and
reproduction  rights.  The  reproduction  right  enters  into   play   where
platforms need to make copies to offer the protected content to  the  public
(upstream), copies made on services and on users’ devices as well  as  where
the platform’s  service  involves  the  licensing  of  subsequent  permanent
copies to consumers (downstream).  As  noted  above,  several  thousand  on-
demand services operate in the EU and license content on a daily  basis[13].
 We see this as evidence that the fact that several rights are  involved  in
individual models does not cause problems.   As  mentioned  above,  this  is
also the case in the off-line environment and has not  caused  problems  for
our members  who  often  act  both  as  licensors  of  film/TV  content  and
licensees of music used in the film (where applicable).

Any legislative intervention which would  limit  the  scope  of  the  making
available and/or reproduction rights  and  thereby  hinder  the  ability  of
audiovisual right holders to license their works  would  raise  issues  with
the EU’s obligations under international copyright norms.

   3. Linking and browsing


11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or  other  subject
   matter protected under copyright, either in  general  or  under  specific
   circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


( YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why

EU copyright legislation and jurisprudence generally provides the  requisite
clarity on the matter of linking and browsing.  National  courts  have  made
important contributions to the understanding of  the  communication  to  the
public right and indeed, as the Consultation Document notes,  the  CJEU  has
recently been asked  to  look  at  several  important  fact  patterns.   The
importance that hyperlinking plays with regard to  content  delivery  online
means that a broad  exclusion  from  copyright  protection  would  not  only
undermine basic licensing practices  online  but  it  would  also  seriously
hinder the  ability  of  right  holders  to  fight  copyright  infringements
online.

Question 11 is somewhat unclear and the answer depends to a large extent  on
whether the provider of the link performs a material  intervention  to  make
the content available  to  a  new  audience.   The  parameters  are  already
largely defined by CJEU judgements and  this  already  substantial  body  of
case law will further  crystallize  as  it  pertains  to  the  Internet  and
linking by way of the pending Svensson[14], BestWater International[15]  and
C More Entertainment[16] referrals (decisions expected in 2014).

Further legislative action is not needed in this area. It is vital that  the
courts retain the possibility to respond to specific fact patterns. In  this
area, any legislation attempting to establish specific or  inflexible  rules
for when a particular technical operation online amounts to a  communication
to the public risks being outdated quickly and could remove the ability  for
the courts to consider the specific circumstances  of  a  given  case.   The
complexities  and   constantly   evolving   nature   of   online   copyright
infringement are  such  that  this  could  have  the  unintended  effect  of
hindering enforcement efforts – or indeed certain forms of  licensing  which
operate by means of linking.

12. Should the viewing of  a  web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
   reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under  copyright
   on the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer,  either  in
   general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the  authorisation
   of the rightholder?


( YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why

For reasons similar to those stated above in  the  context  of  linking,  we
take  the  view  that  current  legislation  and  the  courts  can   provide
sufficient clarity to address cases  arising  from  specific  circumstances.
As a general matter, the exclusive right of reproduction  in  Article  2  of
the Copyright Directive extends  to  temporary  reproductions.   Beyond  the
text of Article 2, the CJEU  has  already  confirmed  this  point[17].   The
courts should retain the possibility to consider specific  circumstances  to
determine for example whether or not the  exception  for  certain  temporary
copies in Article 5(1) is applicable.  There may be cases where  the  copies
on the screen or in the cache memory are  fully  covered  by  Article  5(1).
However, in the event those  copies  are  made  from  illegal  sources  (see
Article 5(1)(b)) the exception may not apply[18].  This can  be  crucial  to
the application of Article 8(3) – it is crucial not to  immunise  infringing
sites from potential legal action on the basis  that  their  users  are  not
infringing copyright – even though the  site  is  clearly  making  available
infringing copies of protected works.

   4. Download to own digital content


13. [In particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
   restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have  purchased
   (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


( NO

The  EU  doctrine  of  exhaustion  of  rights  is  well  established  in  EU
legislation and jurisprudence –  Article  3.3  of  the  Copyright  Directive
provides that the communication to the public and  making  available  rights
are not exhausted.

Licensing terms  governing  on-demand  transactions,  based  on  the  making
available right and agreed contractual terms, that grant  usage  rights  and
prohibit the resale of digital files – particularly where  the  consumer  is
made aware of these terms in advance before purchase - are  transparent  and
necessary to sustain such business models.


14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a  service  provider:]  What
   would be the consequences of providing a  legal  framework  enabling  the
   resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market
   (type of content) concerned.


The  EU  doctrine  of  exhaustion  of  rights  is  well  established  in  EU
legislation and jurisprudence and  has  played  an  important  role  in  the
development of the single market with regard  to  tangible  copies  and  the
distribution right.  While the CJEU has provided some further  clarification
in the UsedSoft[19] and TV Catchup[20] decisions, the  concept  of  “digital
exhaustion”  presents  radically  different  issues  that  go  well   beyond
tangible copies and the distribution right.  Instead, both the  reproduction
and making available rights are at issue,  none  of  which  are  subject  of
exhaustion under  EU  law.   The  ruling  in  UsedSoft  cannot  be  extended
directly to making available of works other than  computer  programs,  since
it was issued under the Computer Programs Directive[21]. Moreover,  Usedsoft
“cannot remedy that there is no exhaustion of the  reproduction  right”[22].
Providing  otherwise  would  raise  serious   issues   under   international
copyright treaties.

If the online market place is  to  thrive,  right  holders  must  retain  an
ability to manage new  business  models  based  on  creative  licensing  and
innovative new offers.  Despite good faith intentions, it  is  not  possible
to verify and/or manage transfers of digital content.  A regime of  “digital
exhaustion” based on a concept of “forward  and  delete”  is  unworkable  in
practice. Indeed, digital exhaustion has no place in an environment that  is
increasingly based on licensing access to protected works  and  cloud  based
services.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?



  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level  help  in  the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


( NO

Considerable  progress  has  been  achieved   by   industry   and   relevant
stakeholders in  the  development  of  publicly  accessible  registries  and
databases of information about  works,  authors/related  right  holders  and
other data that make it significantly faster, cheaper and easier  accurately
to  identify  right  holders  in  a  wide  range  of  works.   A  number  of
initiatives  focus  specifically  on  the  audiovisual  sector.   Two   main
identifier systems are currently used in the audiovisual  sector:  the  ISO-
labelled International Standard Audiovisual  Number  (ISAN  –  www.isan.org)
and the Entertainment Identifier  Registry  (EIDR  –  www.eidr.org).   Thus,
there is already advanced and constructive efforts  across  the  audiovisual
sector in making information about  the  identity  and  contact  points  for
right holders more broadly and expeditiously available, and in  facilitating
identification and licensing of works in the digital environment.

In the audiovisual sector, the centralisation of rights  with  the  producer
means that there is  less  demand  for  the  creation  of  a  repository  of
ownership and license information.  In any event,  any  registration  system
and/or database must remain voluntary, both for  practical  reasons  and  in
order to be in line with international norms.


16.  What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

We do not believe  that  an  EU  level  registration  system  could  provide
advantages over and above current audiovisual industry efforts in the  field
of identifiers.  Irrespective of the nature of  registration  systems,  they
must be cost-effective, robust  and  secure,  subject  to  being  constantly
updated, deploy state of the art technology and  have  effective  anti-fraud
measures in place.


17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

In the absence of robust fraud detection and a means of constantly  updating
information to ensure its accuracy and legitimacy, registration systems  can
be used to infringe or misappropriate rights.


18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

Any incentives to right holders would have to flow  from  benefits  inherent
in the registration system itself.  Incentives linked to  protection  and/or
enforcement of rights will not be compatible  with  international  copyright
norms.


How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers



19.  What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the   adoption
   of identifiers in the content sector, and in  promoting  the  development
   and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

 
As mentioned above, two main identifier systems are currently  used  in  the
audiovisual sector:  the  ISO-labelled  International  Standard  Audiovisual
Number (ISAN –  www.isan.org)  and  the  Entertainment  Identifier  Registry
(EIDR – www.eidr.org).

The role of the EU should be  to  continue  to  facilitate  discussions  and
encourage marketplace solutions to interoperability.  Given the efforts  and
progress in the private sector, we do not believe the  case  has  been  made
for any EU intervention in this space.


Term of protection – is it appropriate?


  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

( YES

We see no reason why terms of copyright protection should  be  different  in
the  digital  environment.   Irrespective  of  whether  the  copyright  work
produced for and disseminated in the analogue or  the  digital  environment,
the costs of developing, creating,  producing,  marketing  and  distributing
the work are such that an adequate period of time is required to recoup  the
investment.   Creative  contributors’  efforts  are  the  same  as  are  the
economic risks involved in the production, marketing  and  dissemination  of
the protected work.

The current terms of protection are appropriate.  We oppose  any  initiative
to shorten or even modify terms of protection.   Such  efforts  would  raise
serious issues under the EU  Charter  on  Fundamental  Rights  and  Freedoms
where the right to private property, as well as the right to  protection  of
intellectual property (Art. 17) is guaranteed.


Limitations & Exceptions in the Single Market


  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

( NO. The Copyright Directive  sets  forth  an  exhaustive  list  of  twenty
exceptions and  limitations.   The  current  regime  of  one  mandatory  and
otherwise optional exceptions allows for a flexible  and  proportionate  use
of protected  works  and  an  adequate  degree  of  harmonisation  has  been
achieved.  This legislative approach of optional exceptions with some  scope
for  Member  State  flexibility  in  the  national  implementation  is   the
appropriate legislative choice in a time of rapid technological  development
and everyday launch of new models  for  distribution  of  protected  content
online.  This approach is also in line with the principle  of  subsidiarity.
We are not aware of any practical problems that have arisen with respect  to
the optional nature of the exhaustive list of exceptions.

With  the  current  options,  EU  Member  States  may,  in  line  with   the
subsidiarity  principle,   decide   themselves   which   limitation   and/or
exceptions they believe are  best  suited  to  serve  the  public  interest,
foster economic growth and preserve cultural heritage and diversity.

At the same time, a significant degree  of  convergence  between  the  legal
systems  of  the  Member  States  has  developed  due  to  EU   legislation.
Moreover, the CJEU  plays  an  important  clarifying  role  by  providing  a
uniform interpretation of exceptions.  The  application  of  the  three-step
test is a key element in ensuring that a fair balance  is  achieved  between
users’ interests and right holders’ exclusive rights.

  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

( NO - The current structure offers flexibility and represents an  effective
working compromise. If limitations and exceptions were made mandatory,  many
Member States which do not provide for certain exceptions in their  national
law, would be required to implement new exceptions, many of which  would  be
alien to their current legal system, culture and  traditions.   Furthermore,
as  the  Member  States  would  then  be  required  to  transpose  mandatory
limitations  and  exceptions,  they  would  also  need  to  implement  those
limitations and exceptions, where the CJEU has not yet  provided  a  uniform
interpretation.  At present,  EU  and  international  law  gives  EU  Member
States the vital and necessary degree of flexibility which  is  particularly
important in view of the different legal systems and traditions  of  the  28
Member States.

We continue to question the evidence of the  need  to  make  exceptions  and
limitations mandatory – the case for mandatory  exceptions  has  simply  not
been made.  In fact, the current EU  Copyright  framework  –  including  the
optional approach for exceptions and limitations –  provides  the  necessary
flexibility  for  promoting  both  creativity  and  innovation  as  well  as
important protection of the resulting  works.   This  is  evidenced  by  the
sheer volume of new works available – and the abundance of new  devices  and
delivery systems through which works can be accessed and enjoyed  throughout
the European Union.

  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

( NO - There is no need to add or to  remove  any  of  the  limitations  and
exceptions in the Copyright Directive.  The case for new exceptions has  not
been made.  Copyright has and continues to evolve in  Europe.   Where  there
is evidence of market failure or regulatory flaws and  there  is  sufficient
consensus, solutions have been found (e.g. the Orphan  Works  Directive  and
the forthcoming Directive  on  Collective  Rights  Management).   Periodical
evaluations of copyright law and how it is functioning to achieve  its  aims
are important.  However, evidence for the need to change  must  be  provided
by those who seek such change.  We do not believe  that  such  evidence  has
been produced.

Copyright  should  continue  to  serve  the  public  interest  by  fostering
incentives to create, finance, market and distribute new works and  to  make
those works available to the public in new and innovative, compelling  ways.
 The three-step test remains a flexible and pragmatic legal  tool  providing
legislators and courts with the necessary room for  manoeuvre  when  framing
and interpreting exceptions and limitations.

  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?


( NO - As mentioned above, flexibility is already an important component  of
the EU Copyright Acquis.  In between national copyright systems and  the  EU
Copyright Acquis, there exists a fair amount of margin  to  manoeuvre.   The
Copyright Directive, underpinned by recent jurisprudence  of  the  CJEU,  is
itself innovative.  In the field  of  online  search  and  social  networks,
which has experienced massive growth in recent years,  it  should  be  noted
that no EU legislation or judicial  decisions  have  undermined,  let  alone
prevented,  the  launch  and/or  sustainability   of   such   services   and
activities.  The EU legal framework, including  the  Copyright  and  the  E-
Commerce Directives, has provided sufficient scope  to  allow  new  Internet
companies and platforms to thrive economically without specific  regulation.


Given the flexibility afforded to  Member  States  by  the  current  system,
where national copyright systems and the  Copyright  Directive  coexist  and
are underpinned by the jurisprudence of the CJEU,  there  appears  to  be  a
more  than  sufficient  amount  of  flexibility  to  foster  innovation  and
accommodate developments in  technology,  new  uses  and  changing  consumer
demand.

  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

See above in Question 24.

Although it is often asserted that a ‘fair use’ doctrine could provide  more
flexibility  than  the  European  system  of   predefined   exceptions   and
limitations, ‘fair use’ has its own disadvantages, including  in  particular
legal uncertainty.  Fair use is determined on  a  case-by-case  basis,  each
case being examined on its merits thereby making a priori analysis  hard  to
predict.  Courts are  required  to  consider  each  of  the  four  statutory
factors relevant to establishing ‘fair use’[23], but  Congress  and  the  US
Supreme Court have made it clear that “no  generally  applicable  definition
is possible”.  Each case must be determined on its own facts.

The European system of pre-defined exceptions  and  limitations  corresponds
better to the legal tradition of the great majority of  European  countries.
Indeed, even  the  UK  system,  which  is  underpinned  by  the  common  law
tradition, tends toward more specificity in the statute.  In  addition,  the
three-step test (as mentioned above) also grants a  measure  of  flexibility
to national legislators and  the  courts.   This  is  borne  out  by  recent
judgments of the CJEU.

  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?


( NO - Due to the territorial nature of copyright, the question  of  whether
or not a particular limitation or exception is relevant to  a  specific  act
of exploitation is a matter for the law of the country where  protection  is
sought (generally where the use in question is taking place).   This  system
brings a significant degree of clarity – recent decisions of the  CJEU  have
also played a role in this area.

We are not aware of problems in this area.

  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)


Based on international norms and EU law,  such  uses  would  be  subject  to
compensation by the user in the country of where the use takes place.


Access to content in libraries and archives



   1. Preservation and archiving




  28. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
      preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your
      collection?
   (b) [In particular if you are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
   problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments, museum or
   archives of the preservation exception?

( NO.  Members are committed to the preservation of Europe’s  film  heritage
and to providing  access  to  it  for  cultural,  educational  and  research
purposes.  In this connection, we  would  like  to  draw  attention  to  the
framework agreement on voluntary deposit with  film  heritage  institutions,
which FIAPF (the International Federation of Film  Producers’  Associations)
entered into with European film heritage institutions already in  1972,  and
which  was   recently   updated   to   take   into   account   the   digital
environment[24].   More  recently,  in  the  context  of  the   Commission’s
“Licences   for   Europe”   initiative,   FIAPF   worked    together    with
representatives of  film  heritage  institutions,  audiovisual  authors  and
collective management organisations to agree upon a Statement of  Principles
and  Procedures[25]  which  will  be  recommended  and   promoted   by   its
signatories as a tool to facilitate discussions on the  relevant  terms  for
digitisation  and  access  to  European   cinematographic   heritage   works
conserved in European film heritage institutions.

We  note  that  many  right  holders  commit  important  resources  to   the
preservation, restoration and digitization of their works  with  a  view  to
providing access to the film  heritage,  be  it  of  European  or  of  third
country origin.  It is important to recognize  right  holders’  intellectual
property rights, i.e. private property rights, in  their  works  and  ensure
coordination of efforts by right holders and film heritage  institutions  to
avoid duplication and to ensure the optimal deployment of resources.

      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed

41. Would it be  necessary  to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already

We do not believe that the approach developed for print works  in  the  2011
MoU  referenced  in  Question  40  is  appropriate  for  audiovisual  works.
Therefore, FIAPF has worked together with representatives of  film  heritage
institutions, audiovisual authors and  collective  management  organisations
to agree upon a Statement of Principles and  Procedures[26]  which  will  be
recommended and  promoted  by  its  signatories  as  a  tool  to  facilitate

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?



   (b) [In particular if you are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
   persons  with  disabilities:]  Have   you   experienced   problems   when
   distributing/communicating works published in special formats across  the
   EU?

   (c) [In particular if you are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
   specific problems  resulting  from  the  application  of  limitations  or

   in special formats, including across borders?


We support the need to provide practical solutions to facilitate the  access
to audiovisual content for users with disabilities. Special  subtitling  and
audio description tools are  increasingly  made  available.   The  Copyright
Directive contains several provisions relevant to promoting access to  users
with disabilities, for example, Article 5(3)(b) allows for  different  kinds
of uses and illustrates that the flexible approach taken  by  the  Directive
can be adapted to the  various  categories  of  copyright  works,  forms  of
distribution, and especially to the particular  needs  of  disabled  persons
and their individual disability.  Any new separate mandatory provision,  for
example  providing  for  an  obligation  to  make  available  content  in  a
particular format would  be  incompatible  with  technological  developments
over time and would be ill adapted to  meeting  the  different  current  and
future needs of individual  disabled  users.   In  general,  individual  and
flexible contractual solutions are best suited to achieve the  objective  of
better accessibility of audiovisual content for users with disabilities.

( NO –

The EU Copyright Acquis provides sufficient  flexibility  for  users  to  be
able to  generate  and  disseminate  new  content,  including  incorporating
protected content.  Various mechanisms exist which have been  put  in  place
by stakeholders (such as content-sharing platforms as well  as  increasingly
micro-licensing possibilities).  We are supportive of efforts  and  industry
initiatives for industry-led solutions to issues arising  in  this  context.
Industry initiatives exist in this field[27], and there are  multiple  sites
offering content created by users operating unimpeded  in  the  EU  at  mass
market levels.

Discussions within the “Licences for Europe” stakeholder dialogue  confirmed
that user-generated content services  are  thriving  under  the  flexibility
offered by the EU Copyright Acquis. The existing legal framework  was  shown
to provide  effective  solutions  for  the  user-case  scenarios  that  were
presented to the Working  Group,  and  there  is  an  increasing  number  of
licensing schemes and agreements[28].  Indeed,  our  members  have  embraced
many of the tools offered by social media and social networking sites,  with
many offering content such as film clips and stills which  users  can  post,

  62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?

Copyright is the driving  force  behind  innovation  and  the  EU  Copyright
Acquis provides a sufficient degree of  flexibility  for  a  wide  range  of
technological developments.  However, opponents of  the  current  system  of
exceptions and limitations argue that their need for “flexibility"  is  such
that they need to be able to operate businesses based  on  the  exploitation
of the copyright works of others without having to  obtain  licenses  (i.e.,
for free or under wide-ranging  exceptions),  allowing  those  services  and
businesses to monetize  advertising  and  users’  data  without  paying  the
customary price for the content that drives  the  traffic  to  the  service.
This results in an unjustified  and  detrimental  transfer  of  wealth  that
deprives content producers and  distributors  of  a  fair  return  on  their
investment and consumers of compelling content  as  decreased  revenues  for
content producers and distributors invariably  result  in  less  investment,
including the jobs and tax revenues stemming from that investment.

According to some, this alleged lack of flexibility is the  explanation  for
a deficiency in European Internet companies – when in  reality  a  range  of
other important factors are at play and may better  explain  the  situation.
These include varying degrees of access to venture capital,  risk  aversion,
R&D expenditure, social  legislation,  taxes,  and  bankruptcy  laws,  among
others.  Moreover, the EU Copyright Acquis has not  prevented  international
Internet companies from enjoying, in a number  of  prominent  cases,  market
shares in the EU that are even higher than those achieved elsewhere  in  the
world.

  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

N/A


Private copying and reprography



  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography exceptions  in  the
      digital environment


( NO

The language of the Copyright Directive itself is  quite  clear  and  recent
case law has provided additional  clarification.   Article  5.2(b)  provides
that on condition that the following conditions are  met,  acts  of  private
copying may be covered by the exception: “reproductions on any medium  by  a
natural person for private use and for ends that  are  neither  directly  or
indirectly commercial, on  condition  that  the  rightholders  receive  fair
compensation which takes account of the application  or  non-application  of
technological measures...”. Specific reference is made to copies  undertaken
“by a natural person for private use”.  As a result, copies made by a  third
party, or for a third party, are excluded from  the  scope  of  the  private
copy exception as set out in Article 5.2(b) as are  reproductions  made  by,
for, or within legal entities.  In addition, a reference  to  the  principle
of legal source/access (the private copy  exception  only  comes  into  play
when the source/access is legal)[29] as well  as  strict  adherence  to  the
three-step test set out  in  Article  5.5  of  the  Copyright  Directive  is
essential.  Finally, appropriate legal protection of technological  measures
as required by Article 6 of the Copyright Directive must be  made  available
under national law.  Appropriate legal protection  includes  protection  for
access  and  copy  controls,  prohibition  of  acts  of  circumvention   and
preparatory acts of circumvention accompanied by effective sanctions.

The digital distribution of copyright works can be  effectively  managed  at
source through technology or content management solutions, and  payment  can
be made directly.  This presents a vast range  of  opportunities  for  right
holders to engage in direct  licensing.   As  DRM-enabled  licensing  offers
greater efficiency and reduced costs, it benefits  electronic  commerce  and
end-users.  An example is cloud-based technologies, or  digital  lockers  in
the cloud, which have boosted  the  direct  exercise  of  exclusive  rights.
Because legal copies in the cloud will invariably be licensed copies,  there
is no basis to apply levies.  To  the  extent  that  technological  measures
permit the direct exercise of the  exclusive  right  of  reproduction,  this
benefits not only all right  holders  and  licensees  (authors,  performers,
producers, distributors and publishers),  but  also  the  market  place  for
copyright works in general and the  end-users,  who  benefit  from  a  wider
choice of business propositions at different price points  (no  copies,  one
copy, multiple copies, etc.).

  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?


 As mentioned above, the digital distribution  of  copyright  works  can  be
effectively managed at  source  through  technology  or  content  management
solutions, and payment can be made directly.  This presents a vast range  of
opportunities for right holders to engage  in  direct  licensing.   As  DRM-
enabled licensing offers greater efficiency and reduced costs,  it  benefits
electronic commerce and end-users.  An example is cloud-based  technologies,
or digital lockers in the cloud, which have boosted the direct  exercise  of
exclusive rights.  Because legal copies in  the  cloud  will  invariably  be
licensed copies, there is no basis to apply  levies.   To  the  extent  that
technological measures permit the direct exercise of the exclusive right  of
reproduction, this  benefits  not  only  all  right  holders  and  licensees
(authors, performers, producers, distributors and publishers), but also  the
market place for copyright works in general and the end-users,  who  benefit
from a wider choice of business propositions at different price  points  (no
copies, one copy, multiple copies, etc.).

  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services  (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing  allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?


As mentioned above, legal copies in the cloud will  invariably  be  licensed
copies, and there is therefore no basis to  apply  levies.   To  the  extent
that technological measures permit the  direct  exercise  of  the  exclusive
right of  reproduction,  this  benefits  not  only  all  right  holders  and
licensees (authors, performers,  producers,  distributors  and  publishers),
but also the market place for copyright works in general and the  end-users,
who benefit from a wider choice of business propositions at different  price
points (no copies, one copy, multiple copies, etc.).

  67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the  invoices
      for products subject to levies?


( NO - Although transparency is generally the preferred  approach,  any  new
“display” obligation must also take into account the  cost-effectiveness  of
the proposition.  Any  new  obligation  should  avoid  placing  unreasonable
burdens on the market system as the application  of  such  requirements  may
ultimately result in additional costs being passed on  to  retailers  and/or
end-users.

It is probably undesirable to require vendors by law to display  the  amount
of the levy, not only because it will increase costs for vendors,  but  also
because users may be led to think that in some sense they have paid for  the
“right” to use the equipment for  making  copies  from  any  source.  It  is
important  to  safeguard  the  principle  that  the  private  copy  levy  is
compensation for use which falls  within  the  scope  of  the  private  copy
exception and where the relevant conditions are met  (see  above  under  our
reply to Question 64).

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?


   N/A


  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
   (Open question)

  70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
      affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
      reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
      the situation?
   (Open question)

   There is a system including possibilities for exemptions and refunds.

  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?

Fair remuneration of authors and performers



  72.  [In particular if you are an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?


Remuneration of relevant right holders is a  legitimate  concern  and  there
are understandable preoccupations as to how remuneration models may  operate
under  an  audiovisual  value  chain  in  which  online   distribution   may
eventually play a more important role.   Any  future  policy  in  this  area
should  be  evidence-based  and  designed  on  the  basis  of  finding  real
solutions  to  real,  evidenced  problems,  thus  avoiding   upsetting   the
remuneration mechanisms evolved over many years through negotiation  between
producers and authors or performers at national level.

The existing legal  and  contractual  infrastructure  generally  allows  for
authors and performers to be  remunerated  upfront  for  their  contribution
(unlike the producer) and to receive further income streams  from  forms  of
secondary or tertiary exploitation.  These further payments may be based  on
a variety of  formulas,  e.g.  a  proportion  of  the  initial  remuneration
package paid up on each secondary sale, or a royalty stream from  the  value
of that sale, etc.[30].  The virtue of the current model, in which  economic
rights are vested in the  producer  or  representative  agent,  is  that  it
allows for the licensing process to remain streamlined and expedient.   This
practical economic dimension should be borne in mind before considering  any
statutory modification to what is a delicate equilibrium based on  pragmatic
adjustment to business  realities,  national  traditions  and  long-standing
collective bargaining arrangements in some countries.

Though important in its own right,  remuneration  of  all  contributors,  be
they creators or other contributors to the collective work, is only  one  of
the strategic issues pertaining to online distribution and  the  adjustments
it will require.  Of equal importance is the question of  how  transactional
online distribution and  publishing  can,  in  the  long  run,  develop  the
economic capability  to  be  actively  involved  in  the  financing  of  new
creative content.  A mere remuneration model for authors and performers  for
future online distribution would fail to acknowledge the need for a  broader
return  on  investment  necessary  to  make  the   audiovisual   production,
financing and exploitation sector sustainable and to support the  very  high
costs attached to the development, production,  marketing  and  distribution
of new audiovisual content.

The  establishment  of  an  EU-level  “national”  remuneration  right  –  if
subjected to mandatory collective licensing – would  create  yet  a  further
layer of collective management  and  administration  fees.   The  uptake  of
online distribution services will  be  handicapped  by  such  an  additional
layer of administration.  Such a system would  serve  further  to  undermine
the value of copyright online by fuelling  the  current  misconception  that
copyright is a mere right to remuneration, leaving the weight  of  the  film
production pre-financing  responsibilities  on  the  “classic”  distribution
channels (theatrical, physical carriers, TV).

As a general matter, no  right  holder  should  be  forced  into  collective
management/licensing except in cases where exclusive rights are  subject  to
mandatory collective administration  for  reasons  of  practicability  under
relevant international law.  Such cases are the exception (as  in  the  case
of cable retransmission), not the rule.


Any action limiting the scope of the making available  right  would  in  our
view  raise  questions  about  the  legality   of   the   European   Union’s
implementation of the WIPO treaties. A statutory remuneration right  subject
to mandatory collective licensing would also greatly diminish the  value  of
the exclusive right centralised  with  the  producer  by  operation  of  law
and/or contract.  The end result is a limitation on the  author’s  exclusive
right – and a diminishing  of  the  value  of  the  rights  the  author  can
transfer  to  producers   –   which   is   potentially   inconsistent   with
international norms.  Collecting societies administrating  the  remuneration
rights will seek payment from the platforms (not the production  companies).
 This takes money out of the marketplace.  Producers and distributors  would
find that the platforms were willing to pay less for the content  –  and  to
the extent residuals (supplementary payments  over  and  above  the  initial
lump sum remuneration) were already being paid  pursuant  to  individual  or
collective agreements,  authors  and  performers  would  be  getting  double
payments. Measures to avoid double  payment  risk  further  diminishing  the
value of the author’s exclusive right.


  73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?


( NO – see our reply above to Question 72.

74. If you consider that the current rules are  not  effective,  what  would
   you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

N/A


Respect for rights



   Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more  efficient
   for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?


75. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow  for
   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet  service
   providers, advertising brokers, payment service  providers,  domain  name
   registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online  copyright  infringements  with  a
   commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to  foster  the
   cooperation of intermediaries?


( YES - Though on the whole Article 8(3) of the Copyright  Directive  is  an
effective  tool  in  achieving  cooperation  from   intermediaries   against
copyright infringement, a critical problem is that some Member States  still
have not implemented this provision and the corresponding provisions in  the
Enforcement Directive[32] in a correct manner.  As  a  result,  some  Member
States’ legislation still require the finding of some form of  liability  on
the part of the  intermediary  (e.g.  Germany  and  Sweden).   The  lack  of
implementation of Article 8(3) means that some national  courts  still  hold
that  injunctions  against  intermediaries  can  only  be  granted  if   the
intermediary can be imputed with liability.  Of  course,  injunctions  under
Article 8(3) are granted  on  the  basis  that  the  intermediary  is  “best
placed”  (ref.  Recital  59  of  the  Copyright  Directive)  to  bring   the
infringement to an end and this has been confirmed in the recent  CJEU  case
law. However, national courts in Member States that lack  implementation  of
Article 8(3) do not follow  this  precedent.   We  therefore  call  for  the
correct implementation of Article  8(3)  by  all  Member  States  to  foster
cooperation by intermediaries.

A  second  point  is  that  right   holders’   cooperation   with   Internet
stakeholders in  the  fight  against  online  infringements  is  also  often
frustrated by the fact that Internet intermediaries generally do not  record
client data or they record inaccurate client data.  Internet  intermediaries
such as domain name providers, hosting  providers,  payment  providers,  and
online ad-brokers should be subject  to  “know  your  customer”  obligations
(see Article 5 of  the  Enforcement  Directive)  and  the  money  laundering
Directives.  In particular, right holders should have  the  legal  means  to
identify and locate commercial scale infringers.  The CJEU has confirmed  in
L’Oreal v. eBay that infringers operating in the course  of  trade  must  be
identifiable.  See paragraph 142 in L’Oreal v. eBay. The  existing EU  “know
your customer”  (KYC)  legislation  (see  3rd  Money  Laundering  Directive)
applies to banks, lawyers, real estate agents, casinos and we  suggest  that
it should also be made applicable  to  Internet  intermediaries.   Anonymous
businesses prevent the legal system from working  in  a  fair  and  balanced
manner.

76. Does the current civil  enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
   balance is achieved between the right to have one’s  copyright  respected
   and other rights such as the protection of private life and protection of
   personal data?


( Yes. The CJEU has  clarified  in  several  recent  decisions  (Promusicae,
L'Oreal v. eBay and Sabam v. Netlog) that national courts  shall  apply  the
proportionality test, i.e. that they have to weigh  all  fundamental  rights
before coming to a fair and balanced decision.   In  doing  so,  the  courts
shall take into  account  the  rights  and  interests  of  the  parties  and
stakeholders concerned.

Given the breath of case law on  this  topic  and  the  fact  that  national
courts are  effectively  applying  the  required  balancing  of  fundamental
rights, including the right to property, there are sufficient safeguards  in
place to ensure fair and balanced decisions.


A single EU Copyright Title



77. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU  Copyright  Title,
   as  a means  of  establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
   exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework  for
   enforcement?


( NO. - The introduction  of  a  European  Copyright  Code  or  an  optional
Unitary Copyright Title is very unlikely to  produce  the  intended  results
and might in fact take decades to achieve given the differing  views  across
the EU.  Copyright  is  protected  as  part  of  the  fundamental  right  to
property under the EU legal order.  As a result,  proposals  to  reform  the
copyright framework in this way could raise  a  number  of  complex  issues.
For example, there  could  be  a  possible  conflict  of  laws  were  an  EU
Copyright Code to result in expropriation  of  property  that  is  protected
under national constitutions.

It is our view that introducing a new Regulation on a  “Community  Copyright
Title”  alongside  national  titles  would  add  an  unnecessary  layer   of
complexity.  Simply replacing  current  national  systems  with  a  European
Copyright Title would appear premature and too complex for the  reasons  set
out above.

78. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the  EU?
   Does the current level of difference among the Member  State  legislation
   mean that this is a longer term project?


The option to replace national laws by an EU Copyright Code  would  probably
take years, if  not  decades,  to  achieve.  The  EU  Acquis  is  extensive,
flexible and perfectly sufficient. Any action is only justified where  there
were evidence-based, proven negative  effects  on  the  functioning  of  the
internal market, of which there are none.  European  and  international  law
gives EU  Member  States  the  necessary  degree  of  flexibility  which  is
particularly  important  in  view  of  the  different  legal   systems   and
traditions of the 28 Member States.

and include adequate remuneration for authors.
