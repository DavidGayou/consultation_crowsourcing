              EC Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules
              Submission by IT&Telekomföretagen inom Almega.1

              Summary
              Is the current EU copyright regime fit for purpose in the Internet Age? Is the existing
              legal framework good enough and up-to-date in order to let Europe and European
              citizens take advantage of its cultural diversity while protecting creators’ rights,
              supporting economic growth and fostering the emergence of new, competitive digital
              services? These are, in short, the central questions posed by the consultation on
              copyright of the European Commission.

              From a business perspective, it is clear that the current EU copyright system needs to
              be modernized in order to better support the use of modern, digital technologies, to
              further benefit the growth and competetiveness of the European creative sector, as
              well as supporting and facilitating industries, such as the ICT sector.

              When considering possible amendments to the existing EU copyright regime, a crucial
              assumption that this document has taken into careful consideration is the increasingly
              significant shift from ownership- to access-based models in the online content
              distribution of creative content. In other words, significant changes in consumer
              behavior have been driven by the spectacular rise of new digital technologies and web-
              based environments, where Internet users can access creative works, cultural
              products, entertainment and information protected by copyright without having to
              copy this material on their computers and mobile devices.

              Hence, encouraging the emergence and use of lawful online content services is in our
              mind the best way for content creators and producers to gain higher revenues and for
              the whole value chains in the various content sectors to boost European
              competitiveness in the EU Digital Single Market. This approach has been strongly
              advocated by both academic research and recent market developments.

              These are the areas IT&Telekomföretagen see as most important to address:

                       Levies reform:

                      The levies system as such is obsolete within the realm of access-based online
                       content services, where no actual user copies are made (and whenever they
                       are made, this is done under a permission/license granted by the copyright
                       holder or the content service provider)

      MS levy regimes differ substantially in regards to scope and tariffs, creating
       cross-border obstacles and undermining the emergence of a Digital Single
       Market

       Rules that are favoring models of creative content exploitations developed in
       the analogue (i.e. pre-digital) world should be repealed or re-considered.
       Legislative reform, either at EU or national level, should be undertaken in the
       following areas:

      Licensing of copyrighted material for use in digital services (which are the
       main driver of growth within the creative industries) should be greatly
       simplified, especially in sectors such as audiovisual and film content, where the
       upcoming EU directive on collective rights management is not expected to
       bring significant changes or benefits to the existing scenario
      A broader and more flexible room for copyright exceptions is needed in order
       to encourage the fast emergence of new, innovative services and uses which
       rely, for instance, on technology-enabled (i.e. automated) processing of
       copyright content, which entails temporary reproductions of a vast number of
       creative works
      A higher degree of flexibility should be created at national and/or EU level for
       a more balanced and forward-looking assessment of fairness of unauthorized
       uses of copyright materials which are similar but not identical to the uses and
       activities contemplated in the current categories of copyright exceptions.
       National courts and the CJEU are already bound at international and European
       level to assess all unauthorized uses from the perspective of the three-step
       test, which make it sure that new uses (including technology-enabled uses)
       exempted from copyright do not conflict with the normal exploitation of
       creative works and do not cause unreasonable prejudice to rights-holders

Answers to the consultation:
7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability
of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
protection for right holders? YES

Cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market depends on various
factors, not all of which have to do with copyright and, more in general, with
legislation. The conditions under which digital content, and in particular on-demand
services, are made available at national level certainly influence the formation of a
proper Digital Single Market. A pre-requisite for cross-border availability of content
services on the Internet is an increased availability of digital on demand online
content at national level. Markets for digital content are still heavily fragmented and
highly differentiated. The EU is still far from achieving the goal of a Single Market
where online content can freely flow and be exploited commercially on a pan-
European basis. Factors that - in addition to business models on licensing - so far, have


                                                                                    2 (36)
hindered the formation of a proper cross-border market for content are Europe’s
cultural diversity and, at least until recently, an unequal penetration of broadband
access services in the various EU member states.

Major content owners in sectors such as the film and the sports industries (which
make content available on a multi-territorial and global basis) have claimed so far that
cultural and linguistic diversity is a sort of insurmountable obstacle for them to stream
or transmit content on a EU-wide basis. These categories of rights owners argue that,
for reasons of efficiency and profit maximization, they are forced to take local
specificities (e.g. language, tastes and preferences) into careful consideration,
targeting national audiences through their online content offerings. In other words,
owners of the copyright content that is most appealing commercially on a
multinational basis have been licensing their works while treating today’s digitally
networked environment as a natural expansion of their well-established models of
content exploitations on a territorial basis.2


If the role of the EU law were that of merely preserving the commercial viability of old-
fashioned and pre-digital distribution models, copyright would end up protecting the
existing business models without giving content owners any incentive to adopt new
technologies and to take advantage of them.

In our view, increased digital creative content availability of on-demand online
distribution will increase the opportunities for rural European regions to enjoy culture
and hereby foster cultural inclusion, as well as underpin a wider dissemination and
promotion of the European culture within the EU. From a consumer point of view, this
has paramount implications for public policy since online cross-border content
deliveries will place residents of rural areas (where access to cultural outlets, such as
cinema, theater and opera is significantly more limited) in a position to access
culturally diverse content and entertainment via digital channels. It seems to be high
time to unblock the potential of web-based content deliveries, to try to expand their
reach beyond national borders, considering that recent figures show that penetration
of broadband access services in the various EU member states no longer gives rise to a
significant digital divide.3

Given the increasingly wider territorial expansion and the faster speed of Internet
access services in the whole EU territory, and the subsequent creation of a Digital
Single Market, the European Commission should consider creating incentives, by

 See EUROSTAT, Households with broadband access. In 2012, an average of 70% of European
households had access to a broadband Internet connection. A divide in broadband penetration existed
between Western European member states (73%) and those in Central and Eastern Europe (65%) as well
as when comparing densely populated areas (at least 500 inhabitants/km2) where 75% of households
were connected to a broadband, urbanized areas (between 100 and 499 inhabitants/km2) where the
penetration rate reached 72%, and sparsely populated areas (less than 100 inhabitants/km2), where the
average rate equaled 64%.


                                                                                                             3 (36)
means of copyright rules, for content owners to change their licensing policies and
make their exploitations increasingly multi-territorial or pan-European.

We believe that the following issues are of utmost relevance for the goal of availability
and portability of content (also on a cross-border basis) to be achieved:

   1. The European Commission should target contractual restrictions that reduce or
      significantly slow down the availability of content on the Internet vis-à-vis other
      formats/platforms. In particular, there are several licensing arrangement that
      seem to harm competition, cultural inclusion and/or innovation, facilitating
      market division or price-fixing. Examples of arrangements whose lawfulness
      under EU law and suitability from the policy perspective of a Digital Single
      Market should be scrutinized are the following ones:

           a. Exclusive first release windows in the film sector cause the complete
              absence of digital alternatives in the first release window. The length of
              these windows should be reduced and should become more flexible.
           b. Today’s windows release schedules differ from one EU country to
              another, since each national market is treated as a separate market.
           c. Public funding schemes for European audiovisual productions should no
              longer restrict or slow down on-demand distribution of funded films,
              nor should they raise any discrimination between offline and online
              exploitations. These schemes, both at European and at national level,
              should assure technology neutrality, allowing a digital first window to
              emerge as an option meeting customer demands.
           d. Licensing restrictions with respect to one market may severely hamper
              competition in another market. For instance, so-called ‘hold back’
              practices are growing. By means of these agreements, some distributors
              can obtain from right-holders the holding back of video-on-demand
              (VOD) rights during the whole TV exploitation. Holdback periods, which
              fully depend on contractual negotiations, have relevant drawbacks for
              VOD aggregators, as it impoverishes VOD content library in terms of
              breadth and depth.
           e. Different VAT rates apply to audiovisual and other creative content
              services and products, depending on their formats (i.e. tangible or
              intangible) and channel of distribution. We believe that a harmonized
              VAT-rate should apply on an EU-wide basis for all types of creative
              content, irrespectively of the distribution channel or platform used to
              distribute digital or physical content.

   2. Rights clearance with regard to copyright works should become more efficient
      and effectively pan-European thorough the adoption of registries, work
      identifiers and repertoire databases decreasing search; match and clearing
      transaction costs (see our answers to Q 15-19).



                                                                                      4 (36)
8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear? NO

As emphasized in our response to Q 10, the scope of the exclusive right of making
content available, as defined under Art. 3.2 of Directive 2001/29/EC, should be
clarified at EU level in order to exclude that this right and the right of digital
reproduction apply to online content transmissions simultaneously. In our view, the
right of making content available (or, using what seems a clearer definition, the right of
‘online content transmission’) should be the only applicable right to all forms of online
content dissemination.

Considering the crucial relevance of this right in the digital environment, EU law should
make its application in cross-border situations as clear as possible. The increasingly
significant shift from ownership- to access-based enjoyment of creative content online
and the fast development of Cloud-based services pose complex questions of private
international law. In particular, the use of mobile broadband and smart phones and
the increasingly favorable conditions under which roaming services will be offered
within the EU increase even more access to the Internet and to content stored in other
member states than the one where content is enjoyed or stored in the Cloud. For
business players like system suppliers, service providers, content providers as well as
consumers it is important that the making available right in cross border situations is
defined in a way that uniformly encourages national courts to interpret it accordingly.
A different understanding of – say - what the applicable law is (if the parties have not
chosen through contract) or where the use of content has occurred would cause
uncertainty and would adversely affect all the above-mentioned players.

In this prospective framework, at least until the unification of the EU copyright system,
EU lawmakers might consider targeting the problems raised by territoriality of
copyright for online content transmissions from one country to another. The goal
would be that of avoiding the cumulative application of several national laws to a
single act of commercial exploitation of copyright works, by adopting a criterion that
identifies a single applicable law. One policy option could be that of codifying and re-
stating conclusion reached by the CJEU in Football Dataco v. Sportradar.4 In that case
the Court had to determine the criteria of localization of acts of online transmissions of
copyright content from one member state to another and to assess whether the
subsequent re-use of the protected content (i.e. a database) took place just in the
country of upload or, also, in the country of use or reception of the content
transmission. The Court held the act of re-use could be deemed to be located in the
territory where user’s computer receives the content for purposes of storage and
display on screen.5 An opposite policy option would be that of considering all acts of
online transmissions as occurring in the sole country of origin or upload of the
content.

Obviously, while determining where the act of making content available to the public
should be deemed to occur, EU law-makers might also go a step further, considering
the adoption of a single law approach with regard to the effects of licensing content
transmissions in the EU Digital Single Market. In other words, after having opted for
one of the aforementioned criteria, EU law might also state that the licensing of
content transmissions in the country of upload or in the country of reception does not
cover only that country but the entire territory of the EU, in order to give a boost to
pan-European exploitations and to discourage partitions of online markets at national
level.

This way a revised version of Directive 2001/29/EC would end up implementing the
same solutions embodied into the 2010 Audiovisual Media Services Directive (with
regard to online transmissions of digital TV services) and in the 1993 Satellite and
Cable Directive (in relation to broadcast transmission signals).6

By means of this mechanism of private international law, copyright holders and their
licensees would effectively be forced to treat the EU as a Digital Single Market for their
content transmissions, although retaining the freedom of geo-localizing their content
transmissions when they want to target diversified audiences throughout the EU.
Following the example of Directive 93/83, contractual freedom might remain
unrestricted in order to enable content licensors to continue limiting their online
transmissions “[…] especially as far as certain technical means of transmission or
certain language versions are concerned […]”.7

10. Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you? YES

We do not understand why, after more than a decade after the adoption and entry
into force of Directive 2001/29/EC, the exclusive rights of reproduction and
communication of copyright content to the public end up being applied
simultaneously. This situation raises significant legal uncertainties and transaction
costs, rendering online copyright clearance processes much more difficult and slowing
down the development of new licensing models that might lead to pan-European
content exploitations. In the current EU legal framework an exclusive right targeted at

6
  Even though the policy goal was the same, these two Directives implemented the principle of the
country of origin of transmissions in different ways. Directive 93/83 adopts a country of emission rule,
under which satellite broadcasters should clear copyrights just once, in the EU Member State from
which the programme-carrying signal is uplinked to the satellite under the control and responsibility of
the broadcaster (rather than in the various Member States where the broadcast is received because of
the satellite footprint). Directive 2010/13 (which codified the 2007 ‘modernisation’ amendment to the
1989 Television without Frontiers Directive), instead, extends a ‘country of establishment’ principle from
traditional TV services to both interactive and non-interactive online TV services. Due to the country of
establishment principle, providers of audiovisual media services must comply only with the laws
(including copyright law) of the EU Member State where the service provider is established, rather than
with those of the Member States where the service can be received: see Directive 2010/13, Articles 2
and 3 (which set out the criteria according to which a media service provider should be deemed to be
established in a given Member State: e.g. location of the provider’s head office or location of a
significant part of its workforce).
7
  See Directive 93/83, Recital 16.


                                                                                                    6 (36)
the type of on-demand communications and deliveries enabled by the Internet and
electronic networks more in general already exists under Art. 3.2 of Directive
2001/29/EC. This provision obliges Member States to grant copyright holders an
exclusive right of making content available to the public that was expressly conceived
to adapt copyright protection and extend it to the end-to-end (or point-to-point)
communications, which are the main characteristic of a digitally networked
environment. Unfortunately, due also to the broad claims coming from national
collecting societies in their activities of online music rights management, the adoption
of Directive 2001/29/EC onwards has not led to a replacement of the old-fashioned
distinction between reproductions and communications to the public that, due to a
technical necessity, are both needed for digital content to be transmitted over
electronic networks.

In our view, it is somehow paradoxical that, at a time when the EU is seeking to
building a Digital Single Market also in the area of creative content, the enforcement of
copyright on the Internet is still relying on the clearance of rights – reproduction (i.e.
mechanical) rights - which are designed to give copyright owners control over the
making of tangible copies of their works.

We believe that the aforementioned right of making content available should be (or
should become, urgently) the only right of online content transmission implemented in
the EU Digital Single Market for all on-line services, regardless of whether these
services enable the making of permanent copies of digital works. In our view, the
distinction between streaming and download services is merely technical and
commercial. From a legal point of view, it would be essential to clarify that, when
copyright content is transmitted over networks, the reproductions that are necessary
in order to enable content/data transmissions should be structurally absorbed in the
right of making content available to the public.

Hoping that a mere interpretation of the exclusive rights laid down into articles 2 and 3
of Directive 2001/29/EC, rendered by the CJEU, could lead to the aforementioned
result would be probably unrealistic. After so many years from the entry into force of
the 2001 directive, we believe that the European Commission could either opt for soft
law instruments (e.g. a recommendation) or for a legislative proposal that could
eventually codify a right of ‘online content transmission’.

Finally, from an ICT industry perspective, codifying a right of online content
transmission - or making sure that the current right of making content available to the
public becomes the sole right applicable to online content transmissions – would
greatly facilitate the distinction between licensed online content services and the
application of levies. Considering that national lawmakers and authorities
implementing levy systems rely on this distinction to assess the harm caused by private
copying, the application of the sole right of online transmission (or making content
available) would automatically re-state the principle that no fair compensation for
private copying in the context of licensed services that deliver content to consumer
interactively (i.e. on demand) is equitable.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the right holder? NO

In our view, making the provision of a hyperlink leading to a copyright work subject to
the authorization of the copyright holder would undermine the essence of the Internet
and thus its vital role as the major driver for global economic growth. That fact cannot
be overstated.8 As explained by technologists, a standard hyperlink in the World Wide
Web can be easily compared to a reference or a dynamic footnote, and the technical
ability for Internet users to link documents is a fundamental freedom to speak and
communicate. From a traditional copyright viewpoint, a link, by itself, is also not seen
as a use of a work reserved by the law to right-holders, since it is neither a
transmission nor a communication of the work to the public, which CJEU recently
underpinned in the Svensson-case judgment9. What links do is just enabling users to
gain access to content that has already been made available online. If copyright’s
scope were extended in order to cover hyper linking, such significant expansion would
have severe negative consequences, both socially and economically.

12. Should the viewing of a web page where this implies the temporary reproduction
of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the
cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the right-holder? NO

We do not think that temporary reproductions that are technically needed for a
computer to display copyright materials and to keep them in its cache memory should
be subject to copyright. Communications and interactions among Internet users give
rise to multiple temporary digital reproductions of fragments of content. Temporary
copying, which is essential to the way digital technologies and devices enable content
communications on digital networks, should continue to be exempted from copyright’s
scope, as provided under Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

We are aware of the fact that the CJEU will address this question in 2014. Even though
news publishers have expressed their intention to allow linking to their content, we
believe that EU law should not grant this dangerous prerogative, neither directly or
indirectly, in spite of the possible relinquishment of such a new right.10 Requiring
permission from a newspaper licensing agency for browsers and screens to be allowed
to keep copyright content in their cache memory makes the Internet user’s right to
read content which is already available online subject to new and additional
permissions. We believe that an activity, which is a technical necessity for networked

  The Internet accounted for an astonishing 21 percent of GDP growth (2006-2010) among a selection of
developed countries studied by McKinsey Global Institute. Most of the economic value created by the
Internet falls outside of the technology sector, with 75 percent of the benefits captured by companies in
more traditional industries. (Internet Matters, McKinsey Global Institute 2011),

digital devices to transmit content to each other, should remain free. If it were not so,
the constitutional right to impart information and the right of the public to receive it
would inevitably be undermined.

15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification
and licensing of works and other subject matter? YES

A registration system developed at a EU-wide level would definitely improve the
identification and licensing of copyright works in digital settings. At the moment
copyright operates by default, i.e. by mere operation of the law, and does not require
any registration for the author of a creative work to gain protection and to enjoy the
very broad exclusive rights conferred by national systems. As a result, today’s
copyright ends up covering not only traditional types of creative work but also millions
of works created every day (e.g. Facebook posts, blogs, etc) for which nobody claims
copyright protection.11

Copyright law has traditionally addressed professionally created content. The absence
of a registration requirement has been seen, also at international level, as an
important element that ensured a better and immediate protection for the author,
who did not need to comply with any formalities in order to acquire copyright
ownership. With the advent of digital technologies, however, creativity has changed
radically and has become a much broader concept. In addition to professional content,
which continues to be produced successfully, we have increasingly broader types and
amounts of creative content that is either produced unprofessionally (i.e. with no
expectations of financial gain by amateurs) or released on the Internet under licensing
schemes (e.g. Creative Commons) through which copyright holders relinquish their
rights (or a part of their rights) in order the to make their works freely accessible. What
is known as ‘user-generated content’ is a significant element of a portion of content
not produced professionally that is increasingly shared and transmitted across digital
networks, online content platforms and social networks. Applying traditional copyright
rules to this kind of technology-enabled creativity does not seem desirable, and
creates legal uncertainty for users and right-holders alike.12

16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

We believe that the implementation of a registration system in Europe would greatly
help keep professional content distinct from user-generated content (or from content
for which their creators do not seek remuneration or copyright protection). On the one
hand, the formalization of such distinction would enable online content providers to
let users of their services freely exchange unregistered materials.

On the other hand, a registration system would give a boost to the development and
effective implementation of copyright works databases and rights identification that
could be interoperable to each other at European level. As acknowledged by the
European Commission in its Recommendation of 27 October 2011 on the digitization
and online accessibility of cultural material and digital preservation, rights information
databases are a very important tool to bring down transaction costs for rights
clearance.13 If initiatives such as the Global Repertoire Database in the music sector
were developed more efficiently, in close cooperation with all stakeholders, copyright
licensing on a EU-wide basis would become much easier. It seems obvious to us that
one cannot obtain a license for a copyrighted work unless he or she knows who owns
the relevant right. Nonetheless, in spite of the attempts made by stakeholders to
develop voluntary copyright databases, these attempts have not succeeded. A
registration system would make these tools and technologies indispensable, so that all
parties would have an incentive to have them at hand and to update them constantly
and efficiently.

In short, a copyright registration system would provide several advantages:
        Right-holders would have a simple, clear and legally effective means to
         establish their authorship and/or ownership.
        The functioning of the market e.g. licensing – where legitimate – would be
         improved;
        There would be greater legal certainty. Registration would signal to all the
         intention to commercial exploit and enforce copyright. Other content would
         not trigger such potential liabilities.
        Society would be better off since registration would also help delimit the public
         domain, consequently facilitating access to freely available creative content;
        National copyright registries may constitute a repository of cultural works
         through deposit.14

17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

The biggest disadvantage (or obstacle) in the implementation of a copyright
registration system in the EU would be the risk of non-compliance with the principle of
formality-free protection embodied in the Berne Convention for the protection of
literary and artistic property, as amended in 1971 by the Paris Act. After this
amendment, Article 5(2) of the convention provides that copyright shall not be subject
to any formality. However, the scope of this principle has been exaggerated notably.

EU policy makers might consider implementing those forms of registration for
copyright works that are compatible with the Berne Convention.

For domestic works, for instance, any Member State or the EU itself could impose
mandatory registration as a condition to have access to certain infringement actions or
remedies, as it happens in the US. Moreover, Member States or the EU could impose
such formalities for copyright holders to obtain those privileges and additional forms
of legal protection that are not incorporated in the legal framework (i.e. the Berne
Convention) where the principle of formality-free protection is provided. In this regard,
formalities could be required to obtain protection in relation to phonograms,
broadcasts, non-original databases and for the legitimate application of TPM and/or
DRM. It may also be possible to subject to the issuing of notifications (so called ‘take
downs’) to registration. Finally, any Member State or the EU could condition benefits
such as prima facie evidence of ownership of rights on securing a certificate of
registration.15

19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
ownership and permissions databases?

In our view, repertoire databases and standardized identifiers are, and will continue to
be, essential for copyright to apply effectively in sectors such as online music, films and
other types of digital content. Markets in property rights, such as those in copyright
works, can only function in so far as all information and data concerning rights and
their ownership is made available openly, and transparently. Content licensing in the
EU Digital Single Market would be greatly facilitated if all content owners and licensees
had proper access to the data collected in the database.

One example of such tools is the Global Repertoire Database (GRD) in the music sector,
which has been supported by the European Commission.16 The GRD project is trying to
build up a comprehensive database of global copyright ownership of musical works,
openly available to songwriters, publishers, collecting societies, and users.
Unfortunately, a few years after its launch, the GRD is still moving slowly because the
legislative pressure of the EU collective rights management directive negotiations has
subsided and collecting societies consider rights ownership data as confidential
information.17

A totally different initiative is the Linked Content Coalition (LCC), whose rights
expression language is designed to identify rights at the point of entry to the web by
targeting authors of user-generated content (e.g. bloggers, authors of mash-ups, etc).

15
   In Canada and a number of other countries, for example, a certificate of registration provides
evidence that the copyright exists and that the person registered is the owner of the copyright: see
Canadian Copyright Act, sec. 53(2).

LCC, which is mostly a news publisher initiative, intends to enable all content
generated on the Internet to be registered and assigned a copyright status by means of
machine-readable rights expressions, like the ones that have been widespread in DRM
proprietary systems.18 We object to the LCC approach that it would raise the difficult
issue of a unilateral definition by copyright holders of technology standards expressing
what uses are permitted or not under copyright (i.e. the categories and scope of the
various license permissions). We believe that this system of permissions would
facilitate abuses, on the assumption that copyright holders could decide unilaterally
that a license should apply also when a given work is not subject to copyright because
of lack of originality or entry into the public domain or since a copyright exception
could apply. In short, this would be a way of promoting a new and more pervasive
form of DRM throughout the Internet at a time when other content industries are
abandoning DRM.

We also believe a system whereby all UGC would be assigned a rights status is
unworkable, unrealistic, and unjustifiable. The volume of UGC is overwhelming.
Creators of UGC should not be required to identify themselves and their content – any
suggestions to the contrary would have serious implications for users’ privacy. Finally,
this amounts to an attempt to pigeon-hole UGC into the existing models favored by
rightholders, when in reality today the vast majority of content created is not created
with a view to exploitation along the ‘legacy’ models of rightholders.

Finally, it is worth noting that the creation of ‘permissions’ databases and metadata is
a distraction from the fact that the main problem remains the lack of availability of
open, accessible and transparent databases of copyright works. Even in the music
industry, arguably the most advanced on those issues, the GRD has stalled. The
creation of ‘permissions’ metadata does nothing to improve the quality or even the
existence of the actual information which is so badly needed.

We believe that the European Commission should focus on the GRD and recommend
completion of the project in 2014. In addition, we believe that such data and metadata
should become available under open access licenses and should also facilitate full
interoperability through the adoption of non-proprietary and standardized formats.

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment? NO

In our view, today’s term of copyright protection in the EU (life plus 70 years) is far too
long. As a result of the term extension directive of 1993, this term is 20 years longer
than the minimum term of protection set out under Article 7 of the Berne Convention
(the author’s life plus 50 years). The main justification for such a long duration, for the
Convention parties, was that of taking care of the author and his or her family. More
than a century after the entry into force of the Convention, the fact that copyright is
normally assigned to, or contractually acquired by, enterprises (i.e. non-natural
persons) no longer justifies a term of protection whose main parameter is the life of


18
     See http://linkedcontentcoalition.org


                                                                                     12 (36)
the author. Such a parameter is even more flawed if one thinks that authors are not
the main beneficiaries of copyright protection in the long run, especially in sectors
where authors are not assisted by collecting societies, which act as authors’ unions
helping them share their rights with publishers on a fairly basis. Enterprises are not
people and do not need such a long copyright term in order to make their investments
in the creative sectors profitable.

In our view, given that nowadays copyright is more and more often used to protect
technology, a good parameter for copyright’s term of protection could be that of
patents, i.e. 20 years. Such a term falls precisely within the duration range that
academic research has presented as the optimal term of copyright protection, from 15
to 38 years. These are all term options that are significantly different from the current
70 years after the author’s death.

From an economic perspective, even in capital-intensive creative sectors, the time
span to let authors and content producers recoup an investment in the creation of
works is much shorter. In the US, until the entry into force of 1976 copyright reform, a
registration system was in force and the first 28-year term of protection could be
renewed in order to gain a second term of the same length. The Center for the Study
of the Public Domain at Duke University estimated that 85% of authors of works
published in 1955 did not renew their copyright after the expiration of the first 28-year
term. Considering the authors’ lack of interest in renewing the first copyright term, this
means that 85% of copyright works created in 1955 might have come into the public
domain in 1983 if the pre-1976 law had still been in force.
As the relevant literature shows, consumers bear the costs of long terms of protection
and longer copyright terms restrict price competition.19 Moreover, extensive copyright
terms limit the availability of content20 (especially at a time when, with the
development of e-books and e-readers, many public domain books are available for
free) and exacerbate problems such as orphan works.21

Last but not least, the issue of the term of protection will soon give rise to new issues
in the domain of non-original databases (i.e. mere aggregation of data), for which
Directive 96/9/EC provides for a 15-year term of protection. From now onwards the
first databases which were granted protection after the entry into force of the 1996
directive should then enter the public domain. However, these databases might never

lead the protection field if their makers update them, changing the contents by means
of successive additions, deletions or alterations.22

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States? YES

We believe that, when it comes to exceptions and limitations, Directive 2001/29/EC
largely failed to achieve the main objective of harmonizing national copyright rules
whose divergence created obstacles to free trade in the EU. The fact that Article 5 of
Directive 2001/29 has conceived exceptions and limitations as mere options for
Member States has caused problems for cross-border activities, especially with regard
to uses of copyright materials which take place on the Internet and on a EU-wide or
multi-territorial basis. In our view, Member States should be encouraged to make use
of existing flexibilities under Directive 2001/29/EC, before assessing the need to revise
the Directive for the purpose of injecting more flexibility. One should keep in mind that
the current categories of exceptions and limitations, which have an exhaustive
character, were conceived in the late 1990s, at a time when today’s developments in
the ICT sector and in the digital economy were unpredictable.

The only issue for which we advocate (see our responses to Q 64-66) a much stricter
and more harmonized legal framework concern fair compensation for private copying
and reprography, in the event EU lawmakers did not decide to dismantle national levy
systems in consideration of the much wider scope of unauthorized copying of lawfully
accessed materials in today’s digital settings.

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need
for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions? YES

We believe that copyright exceptions and limitations should be made mandatory
whenever their enforcement proves to be vital for either a proper functioning of the
‘Digital Single Market’ or the preservation of constitutional values such as Internet
freedom and the protection of user privacy. At the same time, exceptions and
limitations might be essential in order to ensure freedom to do business online and to
preserve conditions of competition in the context of web-based markets.

In short, not all exceptions should be imposed to Member States under EU law. We
think this scenario is not politically realistic at the moment and it would materialize
only if the EU established a unified copyright system in the future. In this hypothetical
scenario, national copyright systems would automatically be replaced by a EU
copyright regulation where exceptions would necessarily be identical on a EU-wide
basis.

  See Art. 10.3 of Directive 96/9/EC: “Any substantial change, evaluated qualitatively or quantitatively,
to the contents of a database, including any substantial change resulting from the accumulation of
successive additions, deletions or alterations, which would result in the database being considered to be
a substantial new investment, evaluated qualitatively or quantitatively, shall qualify the database
resulting from that investment for its own term of protection.”


                                                                                                  14 (36)
We strongly recommend a reform of the private copying and reprography exceptions
that would lead to the elimination of levies on the grounds of the much narrower
room and much lower economic value of unauthorized copying of lawfully accessed
content triggered by today’s increasingly relevant shift from ownership- to access-
based models in the online distribution of creative works. As we say in response to Q
27, if national levy systems were not dismantled in the near future, the EU should
urgently take measures in order to remove heavy barriers to cross-border trade and to
coordinate and harmonize disparate and uncoordinated levy systems at national level.

23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases - YES

In our view, repealing existing exceptions at EU level is not a concrete policy option.
Exceptions have become even more necessary to counterbalance the current
overbroad reproduction and making available rights. The breadth of these rights has
triggered an undesirable debate about the necessity to have authorizations from right-
holders in order to perform legitimately technical reproductions that should always fall
outside the scope of copyright (e.g. hyper linking, browsing, etc).

New copyright exceptions, instead, seem to be indispensable. Several ad hoc solutions
might be taken into consideration by EU lawmakers as a result of the fast development
of new uses and services which rely on reproducing a vast number of creative works
(e.g. text and data mining, user-generated content but also recognition tools such as
Shazam and anti-plagiarism software such as Turn It In).23 Such services amount to
transformative uses made by machines or software (i.e. not by humans) that do not
harm the market for the original works, nor take any value away from those works.

New specific exceptions, however, are only one side of the solution, in consideration of
the very long time that passing new legislation at EU level takes. As we make it clear in
our responses to Q 24-25, another indispensable element of the solution is the
achievement of a higher degree of flexibility for the assessment of fairness of
unauthorized uses of copyright materials which are not exactly contemplated in the
current categories of copyright exceptions. This is a result that could be reached
without a legislative reform at EU level if Member States took advantage (or were
encouraged by the European Commission to take advantage) of the flexibilities that
are already incorporated into the existing categories of exceptions and limitations
under Directive 2001/29/EC (cf. Art. 5).

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
YES

  “The world is changing fast. Let's not wait forever faster technology to be ever more constrained by
ever more outdated legislation. Let's not wait for the USA to speed ahead of Europe. Let's act right now:

                                                                                                  15 (36)
We believe that norms that do not clearly permit uses not conflicting with the normal
exploitation of copyright works and not causing unreasonable prejudice to the
interests of right-holders are harmful to economic growth, innovation, culture and
society at large. These are the requirements set out in the so-called ‘three-step test’,
which is incorporated under Art. 5.5 Directive 2001/29/EC. The three-step test already
provides national courts as well as the CJEU with a flexible tool. The test shows that
flexibility already exists under national and EU copyright rules. Moreover, the fact that
the CJEU is increasingly acting like a supreme court evidences that copyright is
increasingly judge-made, as it has traditionally happened, in a more effective and
transparent manner, for instance in the US, where the fair use doctrine was firstly
developed by courts and then codified by Congress.

We are convinced that the aforementioned flexibility with regard to copyright
exceptions could be improved and achieve better results if the current EU legislation
were amended (see our response to Q 25). In particular, what would need to be
addressed is the exhaustive and optional character of the exception categories listed
under Art. 5 Directive 2001/29/EC. A closed list of exceptions was a bad policy option
in 2001 and is even worse in 2014, since it does not help the EU achieve a sufficient
degree of harmonization in an increasingly borderless and possibly pan-European
framework.

We are convinced that the aforementioned flexibility with regard to copyright
exceptions could be improved and achieve better results if the current EU legislation
were amended (see our response to Q 25). In particular, what would need to be
addressed is the exhaustive and, at the same time, optional character of the exception
categories listed under Art. 5 Directive 2001/29/EC. A closed list of non-mandatory
exceptions was a bad policy option in 2001 and is even worse in 2014, since it does not
help the EU achieve a sufficient degree of harmonization in an increasingly borderless
and possibly pan-European framework.

25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives,
interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or
fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be
the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible
effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

In addition to the existing flexibilities, we think the EU should aim at building up a
statutory system where the idea of a closed list of exception categories (like the one
provided under Art. 5 of Directive 2001/29/EC) is somehow combined with an open
norm like ‘fair use’ under US law. The combination of exhaustiveness and the non-
mandatory character of the exceptions for Member States is what make the current
situation unsuitable. In short, what we recommend is a trade-off between legal
certainty, the continental-European copyright tradition (which relies on a system of
punctual exceptions, which could be kept as they stand) and a tool ensuring higher
flexibility in the digital environment. We believe that the introduction of a new
provision under Art. 5 Directive 2001/29/EC allowing national courts to apply existing


                                                                                    16 (36)
exceptions in cases which are similar but not identical to those that the law
contemplates would be a very good solution. As stressed in our response to Q 24, the
enforcement of the three-step test would ensure that the recourse to analogy by
courts in this field would neither endanger the normal exploitation of copyright works
nor cause unreasonable prejudice to right-holders.

26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience,
constitute a problem? YES

In our experience, territoriality causes problems when exceptions requiring the
payment of fair compensation to copyright holders are interpreted and implemented
differently across the EU. This is certainly the case of the reprography and private
copying exceptions, which hamper severely cross-border sales of ICT products in EU
Single Market, in both offline and online environments. Territorial levy systems, which
have been maintained or introduced on the grounds of Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of
Directive 2001/29/EC, have functioned so far without any coordination among them
and in the absence of common criteria set out at EU level for the determination of the
economic damages caused by private copying and reprography. The same distribution
of levy revenues by national collecting societies has caused legal and financial
uncertainties to the ICT industry, consumers and the wide category of professional
users of levied equipment and media. Different and uncoordinated national levy
systems have given rise to undue payments when levied products have been sold to
commercial users (who cannot engage in copying activities for personal use, by
definition) and/or double levy payments by consumers when a levy is charged in both
the country of origin and in the country of destination of the product.

27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be
addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom,
where?)

We recognize the rights to get compensated.

There are several measures that would enable the EU to greatly reduce or eliminate
the adverse impact of national levies on trans-border trade of ICT products.

      EU law should oblige Member States to determine the level of compensation
       for copyright holders on the grounds of a unitary and evidence-based concept
       of economic harm caused by unauthorized private copying and reprography;
      If the concept of ‘harm’ were made uniform, as well as its calculation, there
       would be no difference in terms of levels of compensation between a levy
       system and a State funded remuneration system (as in Norway and Spain). A
       fund in our view is a better option since it has no impact on cross-border trade
       of ICT products as well as it would exempt the ICT industry of substantial
       administrative costs;




                                                                                  17 (36)
        There should be an obligation for Member States adopting levy systems to
         simplify tariffs and to apply them just to a few categories of products;
        The existing obligation for Member States to avoid charging levies on products
         sold to professional users (including both non-natural persons and individual
         professionals) should be implemented effectively through ex ante exemptions
         of such sales from levy charges.

53(b) [in particular if you are a service provider] Have you experienced obstacles,
linked to copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods,
including across borders?

The main problem we see in this area is whether or not acts of reproduction that are
inevitably entailed by text and data mining (TDM) should fall within the copyright
scope and, as a result, whether right-holders should be entitled to license the
legitimate extraction of large amounts of information from copyright works.
Uncertainties in the legal treatment of these activities under national copyright laws, in
the absence of a specific EU provision, might trigger different responses by Member
States and give rise to barriers in the development and cross-border supply of TDM
technologies and in the access to services that these technologies enable.

According to copyright holders, mining protected content in a lawful way requires a
specific license.24 Our view, instead, is that TDM should not be subject to copyright.
TDM enables results that can be largely compared to what humans achieve when
reading and analyzing texts or data in a non-digital scenario. The obvious difference is
that readership and text or data analysis enabled by software or other automated
processes can be undertaken on a much bigger scale so that search into existing texts
and data (e.g., journals, websites, databases etc) can lead to new insights, patterns and
trends.

We believe that TDM does not fall under the scope of the reproduction right granted
by Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC, considering that in most cases temporary copying
(which is a technical necessity for content to be mined) is covered by the mandatory
exception created under Article 5.1 of the same directive. If TDM reproductions ended
up being legally restricted, copyright would automatically extend to facts and
information that are not copyrightable as such. Moreover, TDM is a transformative use
that does not deprive the original work of any value and does not undermine the
interests of copyright holders in anyway. In short, it is a type of activity that would
likely be permitted under the three-step test.

Data-driven innovation is considered of increasingly higher importance for science,
innovation policy and economic growth.25 For instance, it was announced in 2013 that

   See, for instance, the perspective of publishers with regard to text- and data-mining licensing developments, as

25
   According to the McKinsey Global Institute's (MGI) report on data driven innovation, The next frontier for
innovation, competition, and productivity (2011), data mining can generate significant economic benefits, including


                                                                                                            18 (36)
data analytics and high performance computing will be the most important scientific
research priority for the investments of the UK government.26 In light of such
relevance, in our view the European Commission should take action to make it clear
that TDM of lawfully accessed content is not an infringement of copyright.

54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

In our view, the most urgent policy question to address with regard to TDM is to clarify
that copyright holders should not be entitled to control and license copies of their
works when such copies are made by computers with the sole purpose of analyzing
texts and data embodied in such works. In other words, it is highly problematic that a
copyright holder in a library of books or in a scientific journal collection claims not only
the power to control access to the library or collection by a user or an institution (e.g.
in exchange for an annual or monthly subscription fee) but also to allow (or,
symmetrically, restrict) the possibility for that user or institution of mining the lawfully
accessed pieces of content.

Legal uncertainties and a risk of stifling the development of this very promising driver
of innovation are linked not only to the overbroad scope of the reproduction right
under Directive 2001/29/EC.27

The main point we want to raise here is that, if all texts and data to which lawful access
has already been granted had to be licensed specifically in order to be analyzed
through computing techniques legitimately, TDM would face very high transaction
costs, hold up scenarios (a single rightholder having the ability to take the entire
project hostage) and significant hurdles. It would not serve any legitimate purpose and
would not incentivise, encourage or reward the creation of new works.

We believe that as far as copyright is concerned (cf. Art. 2 Directive 2001/29/EC)
‘flexibility’ would help courts recognize the transformative value of TDM and to fairly
exempt this type of use from copyright’s scope.

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment? YES

Levies should not be extended to the digital environment.

enhancements in productivity and competitiveness, as well as generating additional value for consumers. TDM is
accordingly an integral part of innovation and economic policies.

   See David Willetts, Minister of State for Universities and Science, Eight Great Technologies (2013).

  The legal protection of databases is also a crucial issue because of the scope of the sui generis right
that EU law confers to makers of non-original databases (cf. Art. 7 Directive 96/9/EC). This right ends up
protecting mere aggregation of data on condition that a database has required a substantial investment
(“… there has been qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining,
verification or presentation of the contents…”). As a result, the database maker (e.g. a book publisher)
should have the power to control extraction and/or-reutilization of data from the database, which is
exactly TDM relies upon, in a transformative way. Taking the aforementioned example, if lawfully
accessed book libraries or journal collections were treated as a protected database under the 1996
Database Directive, extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part f the libraries
and collections would be legally restricted without the authorization of the database maker.


                                                                                                         19 (36)
We believe that a significantly different implementation of the reprography and
private copying exceptions in the various Member States that have introduced or
maintained them into their legal systems, on the grounds of Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of
Directive 2001/29/EC, create barriers to cross-border trade in the EU and triggers
heavy distortions in the Internal Market for ICT products.

These exceptions are allowed in so far as copyright holders obtain fair compensation,
which is ensured through the creation, collection and allocation of levies. Member
States have applied levies differently on copying equipment and blank media. National
levy systems have adopted different criteria of calculation and distribution of such
revenues among right-holders, causing an inevitable territorial partition of markets for
all products subject to a levy. From a digital industry perspective, this situation triggers
both legal and financial uncertainties.

Such barriers and market distortions could be removed through a clarification of the
scope of these exceptions at EU level. The Commission might consider the need for a
flexible exception for private uses that is insulated from compensation claims. The
scope of any such exception should be, on the one hand, sufficiently flexible and future
proof to adapt to legitimate consumer expectations in the digital environment and to
digital innovation. Platform or format shifting (i.e. copying the same piece of legal
content onto another device of the person) are examples of new uses of the private
copying exception that consumers legitimately expect: these are happening as a
matter of fact, and most reasonable people assume they are, or should be,
permissible. On the other hand, the exception should fit within the three-steps-test so
as to not unreasonably prejudice the interests of rightholders, without the need for
additional compensation. Accordingly, the limit or boundary of the prescribed
exception should preferably be purposive: contingent on causing no unreasonable
prejudice to rightholders.

The best way to bring this situation of legal and financial turmoil to an end would be
the phasing out of levies. It is somehow paradoxical that at a time of the spectacular
rise of online access (e.g. streaming) services, national levies on digital copying
equipment and media have been proliferating. Such a proliferation is at odds with the
idea - embodied into Art. 5.2(b) and 6.4(4) of Directive 2001/29/EC - of removing
levies as a result of the increasingly broader scope of licensed content and the
expansion of on-demand content deliveries, in the context of which private copying is
authorized by right-holders and cannot trigger the application of levies.

If a reform of EU copyright law did not provide for the removal of national levies,
several measures should be undertaken in order to clarify the scope of application of
levies and reduce their impact on cross-border trade in the Internal Market.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of legislative amendments at EU level that we find
necessary:




                                                                                      20 (36)
   Considering that levies are charged on devices that are subject to both
    audiovisual/music and reprographic levies, these exceptions should be defined
    in a uniform way, making it clear that the exception for reprography applies
    just for reproductions made on paper (or on a similar medium) by a natural
    person acting for private use. In its current version, the reprography exception
    does not refer explicitly to purposes of personal use, causing uncertainties
    about the breadth of the related levy systems.

   The requirement of ‘lawfulness of the source’ should be codified in order to
    make it clear that unauthorized acts of private copying that levies are supposed
    to compensate should only come from a lawful source (i.e. a copy of copyright
    works that the user has acquired legitimately) and not from illegal copying (e.g.
    unauthorized file-sharing, counterfeit products, etc).

   Obliging Member States to submit detailed information about all copyright
    levies would enable the European Commission to ensure transparency and
    legal certainty in the whole ICT sector through disclosure of complete and up-
    to-date information.

   If the levy system should have any future justification the level of
    compensation as well as the scope of levies should be determined in strict
    accordance with a harmonized concept of evidence-based, actual harm
    suffered by the copyright holders because of unauthorized private copying.
    Such a harmonized concept is currently non-existing and its absence has
    allowed Member States to give a very free interpretation of how unauthorized
    copying should be compensated in digital settings. The adoption of such a
    unitary concept would help emphasize that many types of copying does not
    end up damaging right-holders and that a de minimis principle should be
    enforced in order to ensure that certain forms of private copying (e.g. back-up
    copies, copies made for purposes of format conversion and private storage,
    etc) are excluded from the scope of levy systems.

   If the harm caused by private copying and reprography were determined in a
    uniform way in the EU and calculation of levies relied on sound economics (and
    in particular on consumer surveys, to determine the value attached to
    subsequent copies), the systems through which Member States ensure fair
    compensation to right-holders would become irrelevant. This means that fair
    compensation systems might also take the form of a State fund system, like the
    ones created by Spain and Norway, which are a preferable option since they
    raise no barrier to intra-Community free trade and do not cause legal and
    financial uncertainties for the ICT industry.




                                                                               21 (36)
        There should be clear exclusions from the scope of levies, such as professional
         uses, UGC – which in the digital environment amounts for the majority of uses
         of content – or temporary copies.28

        The principles embodied in recent judgments of the CJEU (Padawan,
         Thuiskopje, Amazon) on levy systems should be made effective as quickly as
         possible. Firstly, Member States should ensure that professional users do not
         end up paying undue levies for a type of activity (i.e. personal use) they do not
         undertake. If levies were not abolished as such, professional users could be
         shielded from levies through ex ante exemptions for those products that are
         sold to non-natural persons or professionals or “ex-post” reimbursement
         models. We believe that the European Commission can easily identify and
         subsequently fix the shortcomings of the existing reimbursement models for
         professional use and exported products implemented by Member States as
         part of their copyright levy regimes. We believe that, after such analysis, ex
         post reimbursements should be replaced with ex ante exemptions in order to
         avoid adverse effects on business users and on ICT products sold across
         national borders. Secondly, the EU should also make it sure that levies apply in
         the sole country of destination of the product since the obligation to pay
         compensation arises where the consumer causing the harm resides. The
         country of destination principle not only helps avoid the problem of double
         payments (i.e. in both the countries or origin and of destination); it also ensures
         that ICT products can freely move within the Internal Market and become
         subject to levies only at the final point of sale (i.e. retailers) if these products
         are effectively bought by consumers (i.e. not by professional users).

65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a
service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the
rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies? NO

The payment of levies for online services defies the expectations of consumers.
Consumers commonly assume that when they use an online content service they
should be able to access their legally acquired content in various formats and across
multiple devices. This is simply the nature today’s digital environment, as highlighted
by Mr Vitorino’s in his Report29, the Irish Modernising Copyright report30 and the UK
Hargreaves Review31.

28
   For instance, with regard to UG in the 28 countries of the EU, according to Eurostat, close to 23 million
Europeans engaged in creating a website or blog in 2012, over 83 million Europeans uploaded self-
created content to a website, including 47% of 16 to 24 year olds. WordPress users produce about 36.3
million new posts and 63.1 million new comments each month; 130 hours of video are uploaded to
YouTube every minute; there are more than 77,000 active contributors to Wikipedia working on more
than 22,000,000 articles in 285 languages; 758 million photos a day were uploaded and shared online in
2013.

   António Vitorino, Recommendations resulting from the Mediation on Private Copying and
Reprography Levies, page 6: “A person paying for e.g. the download of a song expects that this payment
does not only cover the first download of that song onto his or her personal computer but also the
subsequent copying of that song to a certain number of his or her mobile devices, as determined by the


                                                                                                    22 (36)
Accordingly, consumers purchase originals under the assumption that they can make
copies, and rightholders know these copies will occur. The ability to make copies is
priced into distribution to the consumer32. Put simply, consumers have a legitimate
expectation to make copies, and rightholders are aware of these expectations: these
copies are priced into the purchase price.

There is no demonstrable harm to rightholders in such cases, and these situations
should be deemed to cause no or minimal harm. Mr. Vitorino came to the same
conclusion in his report on copyright levies where he rightly argued that applying a levy
on an online service would pave the way for multiple payments and would be
inconsistent with users’ reasonable assumptions and basic expectations.

EU copyright law and its interpretation rendered recently by the CJEU clearly evidence
that digital copies made in the context of an online content service cannot be subject
to private copying levies. This conclusion is upheld in several provisions of Directive
2001/29/EC. One of these provisions is Art. 6(4) of the directive, where licensing of on-
demand (i.e. interactive) online content deliveries enjoys a special protection from the
enforcement of copyright exceptions such as private copying.

That provision restricts Member States from adopting measures aiming to ensure that
the beneficiaries of an exception can make use of that exception with regard to "works
or other subject matter made available to the public on agreed contractual terms in
such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at time

usage rules of the service provider. Similarly, a person subscribing to a music streaming service is usually
not only paying for the online streaming to his or her device/s but also for the possibility to create
"playlists" that can be listened to when ‘offline’”
30
   Modernising Copyright: The Report of the Copyright Review Committee (Dublin, 2013), page 60,
http://www.enterprise.gov.ie/en/Publications/CRC-Report.pdf: the main argument in favour of private
copying exceptions relates to users’ reasonable assumptions and basic expectations. Users now
commonly assume and expect that, if they buy content for personal (as opposed to commercial) use,
they should be able to access it in various formats and across multiple devices. As a consequence, many
users routinely make copies for private use, and do not believe that this is or should be against the law”.
31
   Ian Hargreaves, ‘Digital Opportunity: A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth’ (2011), para. 5.11,
http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf: “digital technology has enabled use and reuse of
material by private individuals in ways that they do not feel are wrong – such as sharing music tracks
with immediate family members, or transferring a track from a CD to play in the car”
32
   “Economic theory suggests that the benefits consumers derive from any copyright exceptions will be
incorporated automatically into the demand for the original creative work. Consumers will recognise
that buying the original entitles them to use the product in various ways and hence their demand
decision will reflect this”: Mark Rogers, Joshua Tomalin and Ray Corrigan, ‘The economic impact of
consumer copyright exceptions: A literature review’ (2013), page 30; Ian Hargreaves, Digital
Opportunity, ‘A Review of IP and Growth’, section 5.30: “As right holders are well aware of consumers’
behaviour in this respect, our view is that the benefit of being able to do this is already factored into the
price that right holders are charging. A limited private copying exception which corresponds to the
expectations of buyers and sellers of copyright content, and is therefore already priced into the
purchase, will by definition not entail a loss for right holders”; Martin Kretschmer, ‘Private Copying and
Fair Compensation’ (2011) page 68: “a certain amount of copying can already be priced into the retail
sale of the first copy if the consumer understands these benefits”; Hal Varian (2005), ‘Copying and
Copyright’, Journal of Economic Perspectives 19(2): 121-138; p. 129; ‘Modernising Copyright: The Report
of the Copyright Review Committee’ (Dublin, 2013), page 60.


                                                                                                     23 (36)
individually chosen by them." EU law explicitly provides that agreed contractual terms
under which an online service is offered should prevail over the enforcement of an
exception such as private copying.

Moreover, two recitals in the directive specify that in case of licensing - either because
a separate payment has occurred or since the license entails that there is no or
minimal harm - no additional compensation should be paid, making it clear that a
statutory exception should not endanger the conclusion of licensing contracts.33

The CJEU has reached the same conclusion, holding that fair compensation applies
only when copying activities have not been authorized by copyright holders, but are
made by users under the relevant exception. Both the Padawan and Thuiskopie
judgments explicitly found that the obligation to pay fair compensation arises when
private copying occurs without the authorization of the right-holders.34

In his recommendations published in January 2013, the European Mediator, Mr.
Antonio Vitorino concluded that online content services should not be subject to
levies. As he emphasized, applying levies in the context of licensed online services
would amount to asking consumers to pay multiple times for the same content. In
short, consumers would have to bear the cost of a levy after having paid a fee as
service subscribers.

To sum up, the exception of private copying comes into play when right-holders
cannot practically exercise their exclusive rights. If this opportunity concretely exists,
and the copyright holder takes advantage of it, private copying becomes an activity
authorized by the copyright holder, so that the claim for fair compensation loses its
justification. A very good example is provided by Apple iTunes’ Standard Terms of Sale,
under which the account holder has a right to make up to 7 copies of each downloaded
file.35 This means that Apple has acquired from righ-holders the right to let each of its
users copy and transfer the purchased content on several devices, after having paid a
fee a fee covering such copying.

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services
(e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies



33
   See Directive 2001/29/EC, recitals 35 and 45: “(...) In cases where rightholders have already received
payment in some other form, for instance as part of a licence fee, no specific or separate payment may
be due. (...) In certain situations where the prejudice to the rightholder would be minimal, no obligation
for payment may arise. (...); The exceptions and limitations referred to in Article 5(2), (3) and (4) should
not, however, prevent the definition of contractual relations designed to ensure fair compensation for
the rightholders insofar as permitted by national law.”
34
   See C-467/08, Padawan SL v. SGAE, 21 October 2010, paragraphs 39, 40 and 45 (hereinafter
Padawan). See C-462/09, Stichting de Thuiskopie v. Opus Supplies Deutschland, 16 June 2011,
paragraphs 24, 26 and 35 (hereinafter Thuiskopie).

   See Apple iTunes’ Standard Terms of Sale read as follows: “(iv) You shall be authorised to burn an
audio playlist up to seven times. You may use the audio CD to which you have burned your iTunes
Products in the same ways in which you may use an audio CD purchased from a retail store, subject to
United Kingdom copyright laws.”


                                                                                                     24 (36)
on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business
models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

New technologies are changing completely the way users’ access and enjoy creative
content. In the context of Cloud-based services, content is no longer stored on digital
devices but is streamed from the Cloud to multiple consumer devices, where no
permanent copy of the content is created. In fact, service providers deliver their
content on the Cloud from their central servers, enabling their licensed users to access
such content in exchange for a subscription fee. What characterizes access models is
the absence of individual recordable media: consumers have access to the content
they purchase from each of their devices connected to the Internet. This means that
with Cloud-based services copying is becoming obsolete. Extending a “rough”
compensation system like levies to Cloud-based services, where no copying occurs,
would be an incomprehensible choice.

Online content deliveries of music tracks, films and e-books place consumers in a
position to access storage services in a fully authorized manner. If such deliveries
became the prevailing business model in the near future, as it seems possible, levies
might no longer apply on blank media and recording equipment in light of the much
narrower scope of unauthorized copying. Consumers increasingly prefer to keep their
content in the Cloud, using services like personal lockers or personal video recorders in
order to store content and accessing it directly from each of the devices they have.
Unauthorized copying no longer comes into play since all the aforementioned activities
– including space shifting of content from a user device to the Cloud – end up being
regulated through contracts concluded between digital content retailers and the end-
user.

The issues listed below are only a non-exhaustive overview of the negative impact that
extending levies would generate.

Deterring investments in new online services and slowing revenue growth for
creative industries: Today, creative industries partner with digital services to develop
new, attractive online offerings of creative content to consumers. Such services
require significant investment, risk taking and commercial discussions. Should levies be
allowed to develop for digital content, it is worth noting this would be a clear
deterrent to commercial licensing and the development of new services. Indeed, it
seems the logic of such a system would be that, the more licensors and service
providers jointly work to develop new online services, increase revenues and reduce
piracy, the more levies would be claimed. It would also hamper the growth of such
services, due to various levy claims applied indiscriminately in different services.

It is worth noting that this would lead to lost revenues for rightholders too. As noted
by the OECD, Cloud offerings bring consumers more value to consumers and broader
audiences. Rightholders benefit from this increased value through licensing as well as
the opportunity to distribute directly to consumers, with reduced distribution costs36.

Hampering economic growth and innovation: Cloud computing is expected to create
400,000 new small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union, to
add nearly 1000 billion euros to EU37 GDP between 2015-2020 (contributing 1% to 4%
to growth), and to create up to a million jobs in the EU . For businesses, Cloud services
generate considerable savings and productivity gains. For consumers, Cloud services
deliver a host of useful day-to-day applications deliver over the Cloud, as well as new
opportunities to share and store personal content, and new ways to consume creative
content anytime, anywhere. These include email, calendars, word processing and
other productivity and collaborative tools; photo sharing and editing tools, online
games, Cloud lockers, etc.

It has already been noted that levies have adverse consequences on growth.38 Levies
have significant adverse impact on the development of the economy and the digital
economy in particular39. Innovation and opportunity costs are by definition difficult to
predict, but there is a growing body of evidence correlating copyright and innovation
policy40. Harvard professor Josh Lerner recently evaluated that legal uncertainty on
Cloud services lead to a reduction in venture capital investment in the cloud of $4.6m
and $2.8m respectively per quarter in France and Germany41. In the UK, the
government estimates that reforming copyright, including a reform of private copying,
will be “adding between 0.3% and 0.6% to the size of the UK economy by 2020 –
between £5 billion and £8 billion [€5.72 billion and €9.15 billion] – and cutting
deadweight costs in the economy by over £750 million [€858 million]”42 . In relation to
levies, the UK IPO estimates that economic benefits to GBP 258.67 million43.

Segmenting the single market: It is also clear that levies are not efficient, imply a
significant administrative burden and the fragmentation of markets along national
borders. Any European company seeking to innovate in the area of Cloud services
would be stifled by the cost and burden of liability for levy payments, in particular in
relation to its non-EU counterparts. The Cloud and Internet services are global. Levies
are applied by national collecting societies on a strictly territorial basis and are
triggered when a product crosses a border. Each time this occurs, levies add up,
bringing multiple payments, administrative costs and associated procedures. This is

fundamentally at odds with the vision of the EU Single Market and the global nature of
Cloud services. Charging levies, i.e. a duty charged to consumers, on Cloud services will
undermine the Digital Single Market in Cloud services before its opportunities have
even materialized. Yet a single market in digital services is key to driving Cloud services
forward in the EU. Only a digital single market can attract investment in early stage
offerings from EU innovators.

Ignoring legitimate consumer expectations, increasing consumer prices, and taxing
user creativity: consumers legitimately expect that they can make private copies of
content that they acquire. Imposing new payments for their use of Cloud type services
would ignore their expectations, penalize them for acquiring lawful content, and
directly increase the costs of accessing Cloud services for consumers, so putting
European consumers at a disadvantage compared with their peers across the rest of
the world.

Furthermore, imposing rules devised for an age of analogue devices, physical media,
and content exclusively produced for commercial distribution ignores the fact that the
vast majority of content in the cloud is professional or created by users, i.e. user-
generated content (UGC). Content such as emails, work documents or holiday
photographs belongs to users and does not need to be licensed or paid for. It is not
content produced with a view to commercially asserting copyright.

The notion that digital services and technologies are dependent on professional
content for consumer utility can no longer be substantiated. The overwhelming
majority of content produced and shared on the Internet, on digital services and using
connected devices does not belong to rightholders organizations. These activities are
clearly excluded from the scope of private copying levies. Yet the bluntness of levies
would catch all this content, and mandate intrusive and highly misguided levies on
personal content to the detriment of nearly all citizens.

We believe the best way to generate more revenues for creators, enhance consumer
welfare and encourage growth is to encourage the development innovation and legal
offers in Europe, not more levies. The digital economy is a major driver for growth in
the EU, and is expected to grow seven times faster than overall EU GDP in coming
years.44 By 2016 the Internet economy of the G-20 is predicted to reach an aggregate
value of $4.2 trillion45. We therefore fully support the orientation given by the
Commission at the initiative of President Barroso: “Exploiting the full potential of the
digital economy is vital to delivering growth in Europe. It is extremely important for us
to work with industry in order to accelerate solutions which tap the potential of digital
markets to develop new business models. A modern copyright framework can be win-
win for all stakeholders, providing sustainable incentives for creativity, cultural
diversity and innovation, and improving choice and access to legal offers for

which they characterize as a blunt instrument and a burden on innovation. We
emphasize that levies in relation to online service would significantly undermine the
potential for growth of the digital economy, and in particular European
competitiveness and innovation.

71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved? [Open question]

We would also like to highlight some problematic aspects of levies which deserve more
attention.

a. The current levy system in Europe is applied in an arbitrary manner, divorced from
any substantiated economic data and as a result difficult to square predictability and
the rule of law. This is clearly illustrated by massive divergence of tariffs across Europe
and the significant increase in claims. For example the difference in tariff on a single
device across the EU can vary anywhere between 1% - 10% of the purchase price, as
documented by WIPO’s International survey on private copying47. Across the Single
Market, levies collected per capita vary immensely and are for instance over one
hundred times higher in France than in Romania48. A recent attempt in Italy envisaged
a tariff increase of up 500% on a single product. Similarly, in France, in 2008, the
Conseil d’Etat invalidated the tariffs set by the private copy commission for including
illegal materials in calculation of the levy49. But subsequently, the private copy
commission set exactly the same tariffs as the one canceled by the Council of States,
arguing opportunistically that compression rates has changed, justifying an increase.

Even allowing for some differences between consumer behaviors in different Member
States, it seems difficult to reconcile these examples with a legally and economically
sound application of levies. Indeed academic literature on levies acknowledges this
arbitrariness, as expressed by Prof. Towse: ”the copyright levy […] has been almost
universally opposed by economists on the grounds that its remuneration to creators
bears no resemblance to the market value of the works and therefore could not act as
a valid incentive to creators”50. The UK and Ireland have shown that without the

about the economics of copyright” Review of Economic Research on Copyright Issues, 2011, vol. 8(2),
pp.101-120. Similarly, “In our investigations into the levy systems in other countries, we contacted
experts in intellectual property law including Rufus Pollock (UK), Kimberlee Weatherall (Australia) and
Jeremy de Beer (Canada). They were able to provide us some useful information into the levy regimes in
their countries, but also confirmed our belief that levies worldwide are set mostly without any reference
to economic analysis of harm or damage”, Mark Rogers, Joshua Tomalin and Ray Corrigan, ‘The
economic impact of consumer copyright exceptions: A literature review’ (2013), page 27,

exception, rights-holders have not been not experienced any economic harm. On the
contrary, the UK market is one the most developed markets of content in the world.

b. The differing approaches to the issue cannot be fully understood without an
understanding of how revenues are collected, administered and distributed. For
instance, licensing revenue for online rights often flows through a commercial licensor
such as a record company or a publisher, which is not a collecting society. On the other
hand, private copying levies are invariably collected and administered by a collecting
society. Such collecting societies in turn apply their internal distribution rules and,
where applicable, cultural and social deductions.

Against this backdrop, the growth of digital revenue generates tensions between the
different actors in the creative sector as to who collects, manages and administers
these new revenue streams. This may lead rightholders to claim that revenues
generated are insufficient, when in reality the question is how this new revenue is
collected and distributed, and by whom. For instance, it is often alleged that artist
revenues would collapse but for levies. But in practice, collectively managed income is
not the only source of income for creators, other sources including e.g. contractual
revenues.

It is not for us to comment on those issues. However, we merely point out that digital
players who work and partner with many rightholders to increase the growth of digital
revenue are at the same time caught up in discussions that in reality concern the
creative sector. We believe informed and evidence-based policy making is essential to
a constructive discussion on private copying levies. A useful first step would be to
collect hard evidence on the claims that creators are not benefiting from revenues.

c. The collection of levies by collecting societies also contributes to culture funds.
These are worthy endeavors, however, the entities that grant licenses, collect and
administer private copying levies and administer cultural funds are in practice often
the one and same, leading to unforeseen and perhaps undesirable consequences. For
instance, income for which no rightholder has been identified might be allocated to
culture funds; or the amount of levies requested might be in part determined by other
factors than the existence of any proven harm to rightholders.

d. We believe the best way for copyright policy to promote cultural diversity is to
allow digital services to grow and creators to be rewarded through the exercise of
their exclusive rights. The problem is that the blunt application of levies clearly
threatens to undermine the digital growth of the creative sector: efforts to develop
new, attractive legal offers are met with calls for the payment of more compensation.
This acts as a simple, effective deterrent to the development of new services across
the EU.

We stress the benefits that online offerings are yielding for cultural diversity. A
broader diversity of creative content is being produced in Europe than ever before.

The number of books published in Europe has grown by close to 80% between 1995
and 2011.51 The annual release of new music albums has increased significantly since
2000, the share of independently produced records has grown and the number of
artists achieving commercial success has also increased.52 Between 2005 and 2009,
the number of films produced in a year in Europe rose from 890 to just under 1150.53
Revenues are also growing. From 2001 to 2011, all growth in the creative sector was
generated by digitalisation (30bn Euros).54 In the music sector, according to PwC
(2012), global spending on digital music will surpass psychical distribution in 2015, as is
already the case for the UK, the US, Sweden and South Korea.55 iTunes reached the
milestone of 25 billion songs sold in 2012. Deezer has 30 million users, including 4
million paying subscribers and Spotify over 24 million active users, and 6 million paying
subscribers. Contrary to some views, the Internet has not diminished the appetite for
paid content, and new online services are reducing piracy.56 Between 2001 and 2011,
consumer spending on creative content in Europe rose by 25%.57

The current levy system acts as a hindrance to the development of these
opportunities. It hinders innovation and is detrimental to creators and EU citizens
alike, having become an obstacle to the function of copyright to fund and support
creators. Alternative and transparent models must also be explored in terms of
providing funding for national cultural purposes.

e. Challenges of the Swedish levy system: the current Swedish regulation of levies
basically gives the collecting body, Copyswede, a right to freely (i.e. at will) impose new
levies or raise tariffs. There is no impartial board or agency or governmental body that
facilitates negotiations, and Copyswede does not need to motivate any new claims.

This is a major problem for manufacturers and retailers since they have no other
choice than taking the matter to a civil court in order to oppose new claims that are
perceived as unfair. Since concerned manufacturers and retailers are typically in a
disadvantaged position with regard to knowledge of the levy system and of the
relevant regulation, compared to Copyswede, they tend to avoid costly court
procedures and accept the economic loss of new levies (or raised levies) even though
they are convinced that levies are wrong or misplaced.

A possible solution would be to oblige Member States that have implemented levy
systems to guarantee that an impartial, governmental board or the like, on the
grounds of consumer surveys or the equivalent, determines whether or not levies
should be imposed or removed and sets out the levy tariffs in accordance with the
amount of private copying occurring in the market place.

Yet another possible solution would be to dismantle the device-based levy-system in
favor of a State fund system, similar to ones created in Norway or Spain. Such a
dismantlement would be justified by objective facts like the high administrative cost of
the levy system (a rough estimate for 2012 is an administrative cost of 26 MSEK to
collect 86.3MSEK of levies)58 and the sharp decline of traditional private copying
triggered by the functioning of new online media services, where unauthorized private
copying is non-existent, as indicated by figures recently released by Swedish Recording
Industry Association (Grammofonleverantörernas förening GLF).59 This trend clearly
exists also in other Member States, where national lawmakers could legitimately
decide to dismantle device-based levy systems for the same reasons we have indicated
above.

f. Shift of liability: Our recommendation to the Commission is that of carefully
pondering advantages and disadvantages of shifting the current liability regime for
paying levies. A possible negative outcome of shifting liability from the manufacturer’s
to the retailer’s level is that retailers’ market shares are less concentrated and less
consistent across Member States than manufacturers’ market shares. This implies that
changing the current liability regime would possibly increase the overall administrative
cost of levies for the ICT industry as a whole.



58
   Based on the results of a survey made by IT&Telekomföretagen in 2013, the estimated administrative
cost of the levy system for concerned manufacturers and retailers in Sweden was approximately
15MSEK. On top of that, according to its annual report, Copyswede had an administrative cost of
business of approximately 22MSEK for 2012 (latest figures). A rough estimate would allocate half of
those costs to their levy business. The total sum of collected levies for 2012 was 86,3MSEK.
59
   GLF’s statistics of music sales in Sweden 2013 show that 71% of total sales comes from streaming
music services, while only 4% relates to digital downloads. Compared to 2012, streamed music is
growing by 30%, while digital downloads have decreased by 22%.


                                                                                               31 (36)
75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose? NO

In our view, the civil enforcement system in the EU, especially in light of recent rulings
of the CJEU in cases such as Promusicae v. Telefonica, Scarlet Extended v. SABAM and
SABAM v. Netlog, has achieved a fair balance between the goal of enforcing online
copyright effectively and that of preserving other fundamental rights and freedoms
such as protection of privacy, freedom of expression and communication, freedom to
run a business and the right to a fair trial in copyright enforcement proceedings.60 The
recent case law of the CJEU has evidenced that potentially conflicting provisions
embodied in the EU directives on electronic commerce (Directive 2000/31) copyright
in the Information Society (Directive 2001/29) and enforcement of intellectual
property rights (Directive 2004/48) are not only compatible but also complementary.
This judge-made refinement of the rules applicable to online copyright enforcement
has ensured adaptation of the existing laws to a technological context where new ways
of accessing, enjoying and using creative works on the Internet are developed every
day.

In the aforementioned case law, the CJEU widely relied on the liability exemptions for
ISPs carved out in the Electronic Commerce Directive, and in particular on the principle
embodied into Article 15, according to which Member States should not impose on
online intermediaries’ general obligations to monitor the content they store or
transmit. This paramount principle of the Electronic Commerce Directive has been fully
acknowledged and applied in all cases where copyright holders have asked national
courts for injunctions that, with the intent to prevent future infringements, would
have obliged ISPs and social network operators to implement permanent filtering
systems or technologies. According to the CJEU case law, the enforcement of
intellectual property should be balanced against the protection of fundamental rights
of individuals and companies that enforcement measures like unlimited filtering
systems would inevitably affect (i.e. the freedom to receive and impart free
information, the protection of personal data of Internet users, freedom of ISPs and
social network devisers to conduct their online business). While balancing fundamental
rights that are potentially in conflict with each other - the CJEU held - national courts
should make it sure that the online enforcement measures they grant are
proportionate to the gravity of infringement. In our view, the concrete implementation
of the principle of proportionality clarifies that ISPs cannot be requested balance those
rights by themselves and to end up policing the Internet.

In our view, the current enforcement system conceived by the Intellectual Property
Rights Enforcement Directive (IPRED) is based on principles that remain valid and plays
a crucial role in granting rights-holders a high level of protection for intellectual
property rights. We believe that IPRED should be kept as it stands and any revision of
its current text should be consistent with today’s online intermediary liability regime.

 See C-275/06, Promusicae v. Telefonica, 29 January 2008; C-70/10, Scarlet Extended v. SABAM, 24
November 2011; C-360/10, SABAM v. Netlog, 16 February 2012.


                                                                                             32 (36)
We believe that the copyright enforcement debate and the policy solutions adopted at
EU level should be evidence-based. In particular, the fact that online copyright
infringements, especially on peer-to-peer networks, are a result of misconduct and
illegal behavior occurring mostly offline, should be taken into careful consideration
when policy makers reflect on how far certain enforcement measures against direct
infringers should go in the online environment. As the MPAA claims on its website:
“Approximately ninety percent of newly released movies that are pirated can be traced
to thieves who use a digital recording device in a movie theater to literally steal the
image and/or sound off the screen”. This means that, if such conduct were prevented
in cinema theatres, large amounts of infringing materials being exchange through file
sharing software would easily become unavailable.

Finally, we believe that the enforcement of intellectual property rights should not be
seen as a solution having just one dimension. It seems obvious to us that an
increasing availability of lawful digital content and more flexible release windows
would make online piracy much less attractive. There is an inverted relationship
between lawful and unlawful access to content that is upheld by empirical evidence.
For instance, a recent study published by Spotify examined the impact of holdout
strategies on sales and illegal torrent volumes. The result was that “artists who delayed
their release on Spotify suffered higher levels of piracy than those who did not”.61. The
availability of the most recent content from legal sources online would therefore be a
very effective tool to reduce copyright infringements.

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising
brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online
copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be
useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

In our view, the current legal framework on ISP liability, as interpreted by the CJEU
with regard to the legitimacy of certain online copyright enforcement measures,
should remain unchanged. If online intermediaries had been held liable for the
activities of content hosting, caching or content transmissions performed by users of
their services, such liability would have raised legal uncertainty and would have had a
negative impact on innovation, reducing significantly the economic benefits the online
environment has brought. As evidenced by a recent Report on the Economic Impact of
the current online intermediary liability regime in the e-Commerce Directive62, the
EU’s safe harbor rules regarding online intermediaries have triggered economic growth
and facilitated innovation. Copenhagen Economics concluded that in 2012, online
platforms like e-commerce and video-sharing sites, search engines, social networks
and Cloud-based service providers contributed more than €430 billion to the European
economy, up from €310bn in 2009.

We believe that, when it comes to effective copyright enforcement strategies, EU
policy makers should place much more attention on online operators of structurally
infringing (or ‘rogue’) websites, whose motivation to act illegally comes mainly from
the revenue sources (both from ads and payments) of their sites.

77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such
as the protection of private life and protection of personal data? YES

We believe that a fair balance between the purpose of enforcing copyright online and
the protection of Internet user privacy and personal data is guaranteed by the way the
CJEU has interpreted EU law in recent rulings. Online copyright enforcement collides
with privacy protection every time copyright owners collect evidence of alleged
infringements and ask ISPs to disclose the identity of supposedly infringing users. The
CJEU made it clear that collecting user IP addresses on the Internet, processing them
and identifying the users acting behind each IP address amounts to personal data
processing.63 EU law does not restrict this conduct as such; it merely obliges Member
States to ensure that personal data can only be collected for specific, explicit and
legitimate purposes and any processing should be relevant and proportionate to the
objective pursued.64 The CJEU has acknowledged that copyright enforcement is a
legitimate purpose justifying personal data processing. However, this activity has to
comply with a proportionality principle, which ensures balance in the application of
conflicting fundamental rights.65 Of particular relevance is the proportionality test that
the CJEU relied on from the Promusicae v. Telefonica66 judgment onwards, holding
that a specifically targeted activity of monitoring should be preferred to a generalized
(and massive) monitoring and storage of Internet user data.

Another important principle that the CJEU has relied on is that ISPs are not allowed to
transfer personal data directly to copyright owners even though they can technically
identify users on the grounds of their IP addresses. Under EU law Directive 2002/58
regulates the conditions of access to users’ confidential communications and personal
data and their retention and processing.67 More specifically, Article 15(1) of this

63
   See Scarlet Extended v. SABAM, para. 51.
64
   See Article 6 of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995
on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
movement of such data, OJ L281/31 (November 23, 1995).
65
   See C-275/06, Productores de Música de España (Promusicae) v Telefónica de España SAU, 29 January
2008, [hereinafter Promusicae v. Telefonica], para. 70. Hence, whereas a systematic collection and
identification of users’ IP addresses and analysis of all content exchanged has been found
disproportionate, a request by rights-holders to have access to a specific set of user personal data is
admitted through judicial proceedings that aim at ensuring proportionality.
66
   See Promusicae v. Telefonica.
67
   See Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning
the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector
(Directive on privacy and electronic communications), OJ L201/37 (31 July 2002), which ensures
confidentiality of communications and the related traffic data by means of a public communications
network and publicly available electronic communications services, through national legislation. In
particular, Article 5 provides that member states shall prohibit listening, tapping, storage or other kinds
of interception or surveillance of communications and the related traffic data by persons other than


                                                                                                    34 (36)
directive allows Member States to adopt legislative measures restricting user privacy
rights only under exceptional circumstances (i.e. when privacy restrictions constitute a
necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a democratic society to
safeguard national security, defense, public security, and the prevention, investigation,
detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of unauthorized use of the electronic
communication system).

In Promusicae v. Telefonica the CJEU held that Art. 15 of Directive 2002/58 do not
force ISPs to disclose user personal data for reasons of copyright enforcement. The
only obligation that provision creates for Member States and national courts -
according to the CJEU - is to ensure a fair balance between the various fundamental
rights and proportionality in the enforcement of these rights when transposing the
relevant EU directives. In this judgment, the CJEU interpreted the exceptions to user
privacy rights broadly, making reference to both Directive 2002/58 and the 1995 Data
Protection Directive.68 The conclusion was that EU law allows but not obliges
Member States to restrict user privacy rights in the context of civil proceedings where
the processing of personal data is necessary for the enforcement of intellectual
property rights.69 This means that it is up to Member States to determine whether or
not the objective of copyright enforcement through civil proceedings (especially when
it comes to cases involving large-scale infringements) can prevail on user privacy
protection and give rise to disclosure of infringers’ identity.

Even though a legislative measure at EU level sought to create a uniform interface
between copyright’s civil enforcement framework and the protection of privacy in
electronic communications in all Member States, such interface should ensure that
these rights are fairly balanced. In particular, as requested by the CJEU, measures
aimed at monitoring user conduct and/or at disclosing user identity would need to
pass the above-mentioned proportionality test.

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across
the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

We believe that the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title is a long-term solution
that should be examined and pondered carefully, considering the implications it would
have for the existing national sub-systems and for all businesses dealing with creative
content, both online and offline. Establishing a consistent framework for rights and


users, without the consent of the users concerned, except when legally authorized to do so in
accordance with Article 15(1) of the same Directive.
68
   Article 15 of the Directive on Privacy in Electronic Communications provides that restrictions to user
privacy rights are permissible when they constitute a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure
to enable prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of unauthorised
use of the electronic communication system, as referred to in Article 13(1) of the Data Protection
Directive.
69
   See Promusicae v. Telefonica, para. 52. Article 13(1)(g) of Directive 95/46/EC provides that Member
States are allowed to restrict the right to privacy in relation to the processing of personal data where the
restriction is necessary for “[…] the protection of the data subject and of the rights and freedoms of
others […]”.


                                                                                                    35 (36)
exceptions to copyright across the EU would certainly be the best way for the EU to
develop a Digital Single Market for creative works. Unification through an EU
regulation granting uniform copyright titles throughout the EU would certainly be a
more adequate choice that today’s mere harmonization measures to reach that
ambitious goal. A regulation based on Article 118 TFEU is the only way to remove the
obstacle of territoriality under copyright law and to give creators and users of their
works the opportunity to take advantage of the Single Market as a whole.

However, we think this reform would be premature at this stage considering that the
EU, unlike the US, has to face cultural and linguistic barriers that objectively fragment
content exploitations. As we argue in our response to Question 7, these cultural and
physical barriers could be reduced and eventually dismantled if the availability of
digital content increased significantly at both national and cross-border level and
creative works became available to the public in both offline and online settings
simultaneously.

EU policy makers should find a way to make pan-European exploitations of creative
content compatible with (and complementary to) local or small-scale exploitations,
without making territorially more limited businesses legally questionable or
economically unviable. This goal could be achieved if a single EU copyright system
were based on optional EU-wide titles (obtained through registration of creative
works) that might co-exist with distinct national titles (which would continue to enable
purely local exploitation). The alternative would be a single EU copyright system based
on unitary titles, which would automatically replace national titles and would create a
“federal” copyright system, such as US copyright law. As we suggest in our response to
Question 8, the creation of unified copyright system, which would be an excessively
long jump for the EU at this time, could be preceded by reforming the effects and the
territorial scope of the acts of making content available to the public on the Internet.
