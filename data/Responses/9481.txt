   I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)

2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

  NO OPINION


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
PRS for Music is licensing 30 major pan-European music services on a multi-territory
basis. The market is dynamic with new business models emerging each year, and the
licensing models adapt to enable their expansion across Europe.
PRS for Music offers full EU territory licences to all major online services that request a
licence. It is our general policy to license all relevant services on a pan-European basis for
the mandates we have, even if the service has only requested a limited number of territories.
This ensures that these services can expand in the future and grow their businesses across
Europe without need for additional territorial consents.
These licences cover the full range of music business models, including downloads, streaming
and cloud services which can be accessed from outside the consumer‟s country of residence
(for instance when on holiday or business and away from home). If there are portability limits
on access to the music services, this is not due to the copyright licence but to other factors.
                                                                                             4
4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
There are already many licensed pan-European music services in operation across the
EU and measures are already in place to support growth in this market. Licensing
solutions are an effective tool for ensuring that future requirements of the market are
met, and there is no case for legislation or intervention.
PRS for Music has actively supported specific initiatives that have built and consolidated a
constructive framework for licensing.
This includes the Collective Rights Management Directive („CRM Directive‟), which is
intended to support and encourage the aggregation of repertoire and set high operational
standards for multi-territory licensing of musical works to online music services. There was
consensus in Working Group 1 of Licences for Europe on the multi-territorial online licensing
of music that music licensing across borders was already happening. To support the multi-
territory licensing model, there is an active working group of collective management
organisations, music publishers and licensees to develop technical standards for invoicing and
to agree processes for resolution of disputes and claims.
As an active member of the Licences for Europe programme we were a leading voice in
developing new commitments to support small-scale and small-user licensing. PRS is a
member of GESAC which has pledged to issue Best Practice Guidelines for micro-licences.
These examples prove that a digital single market can not only be created in the current
copyright framework but already thrives within it.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
 NO



6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
       – Please explain by giving examples

                                                                                            5
7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
 YES
As we noted in response to Questions 3 and 4, music services are already widely available
across the EU. The Commission has the opportunity to support initiatives that further growth
in the market, support the consumer and the protection of rightholders such as a copyright
education campaign. There is no evidence of a need for legislative action to stimulate cross-
border availability of music. Any uncertainty over copyright rules, triggered by suggestion of
change, could in itself have a chilling effect on licensing and innovation in the market. Non-
copyright measures to create the conditions for a functioning digital single market are still
essential and these would help digital services reach consumers across borders.
Non-legislative action on copyright is needed in the following areas:
1. Investment in widespread consumer education on the role of copyright and the
relevance of rights to creators. This would empower consumers as creators in their own
right. (See response to Question 79.) Technical consumer-information tools, such as „Traffic
Lights‟, could assist in consumer awareness of legal online services (See response to Question
76).
2. Funding and support for copyright tools, such as databases, metadata, identifiers and
standards to improve rights identification and management processes across the value
chain. (See response to Question 19.)
3. Addressing the imbalance in the relationships in the content supply chain created by
the broad safe harbours that give immunity from liability to intermediaries and
platforms, including hosts, search engines and social media. Safe harbours increase the
cost of enforcement, impact the value of rights and do not, in the end, support the interests of
end users (consumers). They have, however, ensured that platforms have no incentive to take
out licensing packages to license end-user activity, and no incentive to share responsibility.
Ultimately safe harbours expose the consumer to liability and impede the possibility of
Business to Business licensing solutions. Therefore, we believe an evaluation of the impact of
the E-Commerce Directive (2001/31/EC) on supply and investment in copyright works, is
required.
4. A reinforced framework to tackle infringement, which holds to account all those who
benefit, directly and indirectly, through the provision of and access to illegal content.
The PRS for Music, Google, Detica data-driven survey „The Six business models for
copyright infringement‟, published in June 2012, studied the commercial models supporting
copyright infringement. The response to this should include „follow the money‟ initiatives
that encourage payment providers and advertisers to increase their efforts to prevent
subscription and advertising funding from supporting the illegal market. Increasing consumer
access to licensed content, and reducing access to unlicensed content, will support creators
and increase the potential for digital services businesses to achieve their growth potential.
Non-copyright initiatives are needed in the following areas:
The Digital Agenda for Europe has listed a number of non-copyright policy areas where
improvements are required to help develop the Digital Single Market. The report „Progress


                                                                                              6
towards Digital Europe‟ published by Enders Analysis in 2013 identified the following as
priorities for policy action to foster demand for digital cultural products:
- development of high-speed broadband networks;
- strengthening linguistic and cultural affinities;
- fostering national and cross-border E-Commerce through e-payment systems and
harmonised consumer protection regulations;
- VAT harmonisation;
- anti-piracy action; and
- greater interoperability of platforms and devices.


A.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
YES
The making available right should and does apply in the country of upload and every
country of reception, regardless of whether that country is targeted. Access and
reception is at the heart of the right. We think this principle is legally correct and
supports the policy objective. We strongly reject the ‘country of origin’ and ‘targeting’
criteria on the basis they are unworkable in practice and would impact negatively on
licensing models and enforcement.
Reasons not to apply the ‘country of origin’ model to making available
1.      The model for collective licensing of multi-territory online rights set out in Title III of
the CRM Directive, which has only just been agreed, is based on the principle of territorial
rights. There is no meaning to Title III of the Directive if country of origin‟ is applied.
2.      There are strong practical reasons to reject a „country of origin‟ criteria. The
Commission identified some of these in the impact assessment for the CRM Directive. It
noted on page 46 that: „identifying the “country of origin” may prove particularly challenging
for online services, notably when they operate exclusively online on a MT basis‟ and
explained in a footnote that „No technical criteria could be used without risking a degree of
arbitrariness: works available for download are stored and mirrored on a myriad of servers
located in a variety of locations across the world.‟ We agree that the arbitrariness of server
location would lead to confusion and complexity. Servers can be difficult to locate, then can
easily be moved. Single online restricted acts can take place across multiple servers globally
distributed across multiple jurisdictions (e.g. Google Spanner).
3.     The arbitrariness of server location would also lead to enforcement problems. It would
mean that copyright-infringing businesses could place their servers in jurisdictions with weak
copyright law or slow judicial systems. So enforcement would become more difficult for
rightholders.
4.      A „country of origin‟ approach encourages „forum shopping‟. This could impact
licensing as well as enforcement.


                                                                                                 7
5. The application of „country of origin‟ could have unintended consequences and lead to
further fragmentation of music repertoire in CMOs. Rightholders and CMOs might well
withdraw rights from other CMOs in order to safeguard a high level of protection for their
rights and reduce the impact of forum shopping and the legal uncertainty outlined above.
6.     The right of communication to the public under Art. 8 WIPO Copyright Treaty 1996,
which the Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC implements, provides for a right that
takes place both at the place of transmission and the place of reception. This has been made
clear by those who attended the diplomatic conference and by leading academics. See, for
example: The WIPO Treaties 1996, Reinbothe & von Lewinski, (2002), The Law of Copyright
and the Internet – The 1996 WIPO Treaties, their Interpretation and Implementation, Ficsor,
(2002), International Copyright and Neighbouring Rights – The Berne Convention and
beyond Ricketson & Ginsburg, 2nd Edition (2006) and World Copyright Law, Sterling 3rd
Edn. (2008).
7.     The making available right is a subset of the communication to the public right. It
would be extremely complex, confusing and disruptive if different rules were applied to the
making available right as distinct from other types of communication to the public. There
were practical reasons why satellite broadcasting was subject to „country of origin‟ in Art.
1(2) of Directive 93/83/EC but this model is not and should not be applicable to other
technologies.
8.     It is important to recognise that there is a distinction between on the one hand the
scope of the making available right and the jurisdiction of the national courts to hear an action
based on an infringement of that right. The issue of scope arises under Directive 2001/29/EC
whereas the issue of jurisdiction is one which arises separately under Council Regulation (EC)
No 44/2001.
Reasons not to apply targeting to making available
1.      It is often very hard to determine whether a website that is hosting copyright content is
„targeting‟ a particular country or not. Language is often cited as a test for whether a website
is targeted. This is not an easy test to apply for websites in English that can be accessed and
used throughout the EU.
2.     Targeting is irrelevant to whether a copyright-infringing site is prejudicing the
rightholders‟ rights in a given jurisdiction. Consumers access and download from illegal sites
whether or not the site is in a given language or has advertising using a certain currency.
Copyright-infringing sites often disseminate illegal content without a sales transaction taking
place.
9.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief1)?
YES
Yes and No.
We do not foresee an impact on the recognition of rights, though note that the De Wolf study
outlines some areas of potential impact.

1
  Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                 8
The remuneration of rights could be affected if licensing is impacted.
The enforcement of rights is likely to be significantly affected by a change to the making
available right. It would make it harder for rightholders to enforce their rights. A „country of
origin‟ approach could undermine future actions such as UK site-blocking cases which have
been brought under s. 97A Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (implementing Article
8(3) Directive 2001/29/EC). It could increase costs of actions and the ability to collect
evidence.

1.     Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
10.    [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of
two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
download) create problems for you?
NO
Many businesses handle the clearance of multiple rights with ease, online and offline: this has
always been routine administration for any copyright business. Therefore, we see no evidence,
either now or historically, that the existence of two rights has provided a barrier to the
licensing of musical works. However, we recognise the importance of joint licensing and the
aggregation of repertoires for streamlined licensing, and we are committed to initiatives which
simplify the licensing process, such as the consolidation of front and back office operations
between PRS for Music and other CMOs.

2.     Linking and browsing

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
YES
Hyperlinking may require authorisation, depending on the circumstances. However, the legal
framework must protect rightholders, and licensed service providers, by ensuring that their
rights can be enforced against those providing hyperlinks to unauthorised content or links
which circumvent paywalls or other business protection. In those cases, the authorisation of
the rightholder and/or the right to enforce is essential and must be clearly defined.


12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
YES
The copies made in order to view web pages should be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder.
If the copies made for the purpose of enabling individuals to view web-pages did not require
the authorisation of the copyright owner, it would enable businesses to monetise unauthorised
content and detract from legal offers. It is clear therefore that copies made to enable use of the
work by web-browsing have in relation to the service provider (if not the browser)
independent economic significance, additional to that derived from the copies made to enable

                                                                                                9
the transmission of the work, namely the fact that they can be viewed/heard by the visitors to
the service provider‟s web-page. An exception that removes the making of such copies from
rightholder authorisation would severely prejudice the legitimate interests of rightholders (and
to that extent would be contrary to Art. 5(5) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
The liability also assists in enforcement as the services are then liable for authorising or
having secondary liability for the consumer‟s infringements. This is particularly helpful where
the service is located in a jurisdiction with weak copyright law.


3.        Download to own digital content
13.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO
     NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
Establishing a legal framework which enabled unlicensed resale of digital content would
have very serious negative consequences on the market, which would undermine the
investment in production and marketing of the copyright content by the producer, and
by the digital service providers who are investing in cross border services, while
harming the creator.
There are fundamental differences in the impact on rightholders of the resale of digital works
versus physical. While a physical copy will depreciate in value and quality over time, digital
content will remain entirely in the state in which it was originally made available. The
exhaustion of rights in physical product should not be extended to the digital framework.
Digital files are made available under licence from the service to the consumer, permitting the
consumer to make a copy, perhaps even multiple copies for different devices, depending on
the business model. If there were a resale, there is no feasible way of ensuring the reseller
destroys the original copy or copies (the forward and delete problem), so in effect the
enforcement of the licence to the consumer, or the transfer of the licence from one consumer
to another, is in practice impossible. Digital rights management (“DRM”) could theoretically
achieve this but since music has been sold without DRM for several years, we do not foresee
that it could be reintroduced.
In economic terms, reselling digital files would have the same impact as piracy and file-
sharing – it would increase uncontrolled, unlicensed and unenforceable distribution of works
in the system, with negative impacts on the value of rights of creators.
„Second-hand‟ digital files are identical to new digital files, the resale of digital files at lower
prices could be expected to drive down market prices for new files. Consumer willingness to
pay for digital files has already been seriously suppressed by competition with piracy. A low-


                                                                                                 10
price resale market could be expected to drive down prices to a level that would drive many
companies out of business.
As note 28 to this question confirms, the decision of the European Court of Justice in Oracle
v. UsedSoft is not relevant to the legal issues here, because, as the decision makes clear, it was
based on the lex specialis of the Computer Programs Directive. In all other areas, the
provisions of Articles 6 and 8 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty, and the agreed statements
concerning Articles 6 and 7, will apply: these were implemented in Article 3 and Recital (29)
of Directive 2001/29/EC.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
NO
We would not favour an EU registration system because:
-if it introduced formalities for copyright, this would be contrary to international law;
-an EU registry would have no functional benefit for licensing, unless it was dynamic
(recording all changes to copyright ownership over time) and linked and integrated to
other relevant industry databases;
-it would duplicate current industry investment in voluntary databases, with no added
value.
We support the development by industry of a global repertoire database that provides
the necessary functionality for rightholders.
We welcome the Commission‟s focus on copyright tools in this questionnaire, and its
recognition of the critical importance of repertoire databases, metadata and standards, to
support machine-readable licensing and automated reporting and matching to usage of works
(„the answer to the machine is in the machine‟). Copyright tools are essential to the efficient
and transparent management of rights and for the effective, transparent and accurate reward
for rightholders.
We have developed our answer further in response to Q,19.


16.    What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]


17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
We are fully in support of centralised and authoritative repertoire registration to improve the
quality of repertoire data because copyright systems depend on good data. But a voluntary
industry-led database is preferred because, in order to be useful for licensing of works, a
registry/database has to be dynamic, meaning it is continuously updated with new works and
changes to ownership of registered works in all territories. The US Copyright Register has
none of that functionality and is therefore not used (or capable of being used) for licensing.



                                                                                               11
The Commission could support and fund industry-led development of a Global Repertoire
Database (“GRD”) for musical works, and the linked vision of a global recordings database.
18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

B.     How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
In online content markets, identifiers are essential to allow content owners and service
providers to identify what content has been sold, streamed or broadcast and for rightholders
and CMOs to determine where rights have been used and distribute royalties accordingly.
The management of information is central to some of the objectives and standards of the
CRM Directive. Rights management requires an efficient flow of information between users
and rightholders. This ensures that music services that use copyright works report that usage
and CMOs can pay rightholders when their works are used.
In the online market, the volume of data which must be processed to manage rights is far
higher than in the physical market. Over the last four years the volumes of data processed by
PRS for Music has grown by over 10,000% from 1.17 billion to 124.6 billion per annum. This
is only likely to grow further in the coming years. Copyright management is capable of
handling the „big data‟ requirements but only if a) usage data is provided consistently and
accurately and b) the ownership of rights is accurately recorded. Only then can there be fully
enabled machine processing of data and rights transactions which can support initiatives such
as the Copyright Hub, simplified licensing for small scale users and user-generated Content.
Common standards have been developed over decades (ISWC, ISRC, IPI, DOI etc). The key
is to ensure their active adoption across the entire online supply chain, from composers and
publishers to labels, broadcasters and online services. Such investments by rightholders
cannot be made in isolation or without the clear commitment by service providers to adopt
systems.
The European Commission can play a role in facilitating and supporting the wider
adoption and use of standards across the supply chain and PRS for Music would support
and participate in any such initiative.




C.     Term of protection – is it appropriate?




20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?

                                                                                           12
YES
There is no evidence or rationale to justify changing a system for musical works that
was adopted in 1993, corresponding to international standards, and later adapted and
updated in 2011.

  II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
NO
The optional list of copyright exceptions, and the differences between national rules
implementing them, do not create difficulties for the use of works in practice, cross-
border copyright licensing or the market for copyright works in general.
Copyright owners routinely grant licences covering many jurisdictions, whether it is a group
of territories, the entire EU or the world. At no time does the fact that an exception exists in
one EU Member State and not in another, or that the application of an exception differs
between two Member States, give rise to problems for licensing in practice.
22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
NO
There are no obvious benefits in making some or all of the copyright exceptions
mandatory. Further harmonisation would not deliver any tangible benefit to the Digital
Single Market, since there are no problems in practice and no evidence in favour of
change.
23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
There is no need for new limitations or exceptions. We support the economic theory
that digital markets reduce transaction costs and that consumer welfare and the
efficiency of the market is maximised through a strong copyright framework with fewer
exceptions than were appropriate in the analogue environment.
Limitations on rights should only be considered with strong supporting evidence and only if it
is clear that licensing is not an appropriate option for clearing rights in the market.
24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
NO
We believe there are no benefits in providing greater flexibility in the application of the
EU framework of limitations and exceptions. Indeed it is more likely to create greater
uncertainty, which would increase commercial and litigation costs.
The system for interpretation of law through the courts and CJEU has provided a line of cases
interpreting the principles of directives. This is sufficient.
Specifically, the introduction of the fair use doctrine mooted by the Commission in the
introductory text would not be an appropriate approach to introduce flexibility. There is
empirical evidence from the US of the high cost of litigation involving fair use (the American
Intellectual Property Association estimated the average cost to defend a copyright case at
                                                                                             13
$1million per case). The costs mean that only the largest companies are confident to rely on
the doctrine, with smaller users and smaller rightholders disadvantaged. Even then, fair use is
only workable in the US because of the substantial line of jurisprudence interpreting the
concept. There is no case for implementation in the EU; this conclusion is backed up by the
analysis in the De Wolf report. Some reform of process and governance in the CJEU could be
desirable. We propose that:
(a) IP specialists be appointed to the CJEU to hear IP cases and
(b) the court process be amended to make it easier for third parties to make representations to
the court (amicus briefs).


25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
NO
We do not believe the territoriality of limitations and exceptions constitutes a problem
for rightholders, businesses or consumers. In fact consumers benefit from the main
public policy exceptions in each territory, while the system allows for specific adaptation
of exceptions in national laws in line with national policy.


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

access to musical works. For example, we have licensed the British Library Sound Archive,
the British Film Institute and the Naxos Music Library web service, which makes over a
million tracks available to public library users, schools and universities. We also license
remote access to broadcasts by students at educational institutions via the Educational
Recording Agency.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


                                                                                             16
39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?

Libraries that give access to online collections can do so for an infinite number of works and
to an infinite number of users simultaneously. This has a far different impact on the market
than traditional lending of single physical copies for finite periods of time to users in person.
E-lending will have direct impact on investment and competition in the commercial market
for supplying online content to users. Licensing solutions are therefore essential for digital
services provided by libraries. In practice, there is no problem in the framework now but
there would be if a policy intervention opened up exceptions or limitations to rights.


4.       Mass digitisation
40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-

44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
Licensing mechanisms already exist to enable the licensing of works to schools for
illustration for teaching.
In the UK, the Educational Recording Agency, of which PRS is a member, operates an
authorised licensing scheme. UK law provides an educational exception which is „subject to
licence‟, meaning that if rightholders do not operate a licence then the users can rely on the
exception (Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, ss. 35 and 36).
Licences and licensing schemes are in principle and practice more flexible, adaptable and also
broader than the exception. In other words educational institutions that take out licences get
permission for a wide range of uses of material. This is a win-win situation for rightholders
and users.
45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
[Open question]

As we have set out above, licensing solutions are already providing access to copyright
content for teaching purposes and as such there is no need for new legislation.

Defining the Issue
PRS for Music actively participated in Working Group 2 of the Licences for Europe
discussions which discussed UGC and noted that, despite the best attempts of the
Commission, the group was unable to reach an agreement on what constituted user-generated
content. In practice UGC is a broad term which can capture a wide variety of activities and
uses. For example it can include: (i) content entirely created by users, (ii) content uploaded
by users but entirely created by someone else, (iii) content that uses part of an existing work
but juxtaposes it with other content and (iv) content that is based on an existing work but does
not use any of it wholesale. There may be different problems, challenges and solutions in each
of these areas, so a definition is essential in shaping the forthcoming discussion on this issue.
The UGC Market
For the purposes of this consultation, and in advance of establishing an agreed definition for
UGC, we set out below some general themes which we have observed in the operation of the
current market, which we believe merit further consideration.
Users share and play with pre-existing works because they value them and manufacturers of
devices and software, ISPs and UGC websites are building sustainable and highly profitable



                                                                                              21
business models based on the exchange of UGC. This value must, through licensing solutions,
be reflected in the remuneration received by rightholders.
PRS for Music already licenses the communication and distribution activities of some UGC
websites. However, there have been challenges in licensing such sites at all, or some sites for
full value, because such services often cite the hosting defence in the E-Commerce Directive
reduces their liability for copyright. This uncertainty is creating difficulty in licensing what is
a clear commercial exploitation of rights both to the detriment of rightholders‟ livelihoods and
consumers. It ultimately creates unnecessary confusion. As we have set out in response to
Q.7 we believe the impacts of the hosting defence should be investigated.
The key principle, however, is that creators should be remunerated for the use of their works
and licensing models exist or can be adapted to enable this. The Commission‟s focus only on
the remuneration of the end user is just part of the relevant issue.
The Moral Right
Creating new content using pre-existing works involves reproduction, communication and
adaptation. Licensing pre-existing works for new purposes is a key, normal part of
exploitation for rightholders: books are made into films, music is used for advertising,
cartoons are made into soft toys. However, the adaption of pre-existing works in UGC may
have an impact on authors‟ moral rights when the identity of the original author is lost or there
is derogatory treatment of a work.
Education
In our response to Q7 of this consultation we raised the issue of consumer awareness and
education on copyright. The use of pre-existing works and the creation of new works is a
prime area where this would be appropriate, allowing consumers to understand how creators
are rewarded, and opening the door to ensuring their works are also respected. Lack of
knowledge does not mean that consumers do not care about the rules of the internet. A survey
by the World Economic Forum/comScore in November 2013 found that 65% of UK
respondents would hate or dislike a stranger re-posting their family photos on social media
(http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_RethinkingIntellectualProperty_DigitalAge_Report_2
014.pdf). It would be in no-one‟s interests if the internet became a lawless „free for all‟ in
which social responsibility and citizenship were absent.
We call on the Commission to establish a common agreement on the definition of UGC;
to support creators in developing fair and efficient licensing models that will facilitate
the great explosion of re-use of copyright content on the internet; and to improve
education and awareness when consumers are using pre-existing works and creating
new works.
59.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient
in this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that
are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?

60.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you
experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for
users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service?
 YES
This question only asks about remuneration of the creator of the new work and ignores
the remuneration of the original creator of the ‘pre-existing work’ on which the new
work is based or which the new work reuses. Licensing models exist for clearance of
rights to use existing works, whether they are music, clips or images, and these enable
the original creator to authorise the use of works and to benefit from their use.


61.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Our response to Question 58(c) notes certain difficulties in ensuring that UGC services are
suitably licensed. One practical solution, alongside consumer education, would be improved
notice-and-takedown procedures, so that an author can exercise their moral rights to object to
adaptation of their work if it is considered derogatory.


62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
The current framework allows for the licensing of the right to make publicly available
UGC. As such we see no reason for further legislation in this area.

63.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
The solutions consist of licensing models, improving information and education on the
one hand, and promoting responsible practices on the other. See our response to Question
61 of this consultation.




    III.      Private copying and reprography

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions2 in the digital environment?


2
    Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                                                                                           23
 NO
There are numerous CJEU decisions interpreting the scope of the exception and the
compensation system; there is no need for further legislative clarification. However,
there is a need for consistent implementation of the exception.
The implementation of a private copying exception is a benefit to consumers, who are able
freely to make copies of copyright works without breaking the law, and to creators who
benefit from the compensation paid for those private copies.
There is cross-border distortion when countries such as the UK choose not to implement the
exception (thus penalising consumers in the UK) or choose to implement the exception
without compensation (thus penalising creators across the EU). A more consistent
interpretation, implementation and provision of „fair compensation‟ across the EU would
minimise these distortions and reduce confusion for consumers.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?3

 NO
The question invites an opinion about a situation where harm is „minimal‟. Recital 35 of
Directive 2001/29/EC states, „In certain situations where the prejudice to the rightholder
would be minimal, no obligation for payment may arise.‟ From a logical perspective, the
question therefore tends to lead to the answer „no‟. However, the practical question is whether
harm in any given situation is minimal or not. If the exception causes rightholders not to be
able to license, then it seems unlikely that the harm is minimal.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

 IV.     Fair remuneration of authors and performers
72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
The copyright framework has provided a stable basis for the EU’s creative industries
which has, in turn, allowed the sector to grow and create jobs across the EU. However,
as the manner in which rights are exploited is evolving it is pertinent for the EU
authorities to investigate whether the current framework is continuing to ensure
                                                                                        25
individual authors, composers and creators are rewarded adequately whenever and
wherever their rights are used. The copyright framework must support a sustainable
ecosystem for the creation of, and investment in, new works and in supporting services
that supply and distribute new services to consumers.
PRS for Music will not comment on the questions which concern contract but we are aware of
Commission work in this area in support of composers, authors and performers.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 YES



The civil enforcement system in the EU should be made more efficient so as to effectively
address and deter services that offer infringing material to their users, whether funded
by subscription, donation or advertising. These types of services should not be entitled to
the immunity from liability offered by the Article 14 hosting defence of the E-Commerce
Directive. The Directive was intended to award immunity to particular activities carried
out by neutral internet intermediaries and recital 42 of the Directive refers to a
protected service as being ‘merely technical, automatic and passive’.
As a matter of principle we pick up on the question and its reference to „with a commercial
purposes‟: it is not just infringements for commercial purposes that require effective
enforcement measures. Most infringements have some impact on rightholders and a package
of proportionate measures is required in order to deal with the spectrum of wrongdoing.
Notice and take down system
The result of the E-Commerce Directive is that the current system of notice and takedown
puts all the resource and financial burdens on rightholders, while services have no incentive to
assist in detection of illegal content, even through the technological means are available.
There are technological measures available for service providers to allow them to easily and
effectively identify files and infringements, based on prior notifications given to them by
rightholders. Many services now employ such measures, but unfortunately most providers still
do not adopt this technology or take these steps.


                                                                                             26
The system of notice and takedown is ineffective to address the problem of illegal content
appearing online. In 2013, PRS for Music removed access to 2.3 million infringing copies of
works made available online. Illegal content spreads very rapidly and popular musical works
will generally spread across numerous different online platforms and services within a matter
of minutes. An enforcing rightholder must find as many copies of the work as possible and
take action in relation to each of those in order to have any positive impact. Even then, it is
highly unlikely to fully solve the problem of the work‟s availability online. In addition to this,
once files have been removed, they can quickly re-appear: either being re-uploaded by the
same internet user, or by a different user of the same online service, or alternatively by a user
of an entirely different online service or platform.
To illustrate the problem, over a 4-month period, PRS for Music sent a total of 849 notices to
a particular service, Rapidgator.net, in relation to a particular musical work. There must be a
limit on the number of times an intermediary can be notified of infringing content whilst still
relying on the safe harbour of the Article 14 hosting defence. Once a service reaches the limit,
there should be a presumption that the intermediary is no longer „merely technical, automatic
and passive‟ and therefore unable to rely on the hosting defence. In these circumstances, the
onus would pass from the rightholder to the intermediary, to monitor and remove
infringements.
We believe that notice and action working practices would greatly benefit if the Commission
were to issue non-binding guidelines in relation to the functioning of procedures and the
interpretation of Article 14. In our view, the guidelines should cover:
1. clarification that the hosting defence is only available to particular activities which are
merely technical, automatic and passive, where carried out by neutral online services, and not
to platforms which are designed or optimised to make available or facilitate the making
available of illegal content, such as material which infringes copyright;
2. clarification that notice and takedown means „notice and stay down‟ and that service
providers are required to remove not only an example URL but all instances of the specific
infringement or illegal content once they are notified and/or become aware;
3. best-practices for hosting service providers‟ procedures that deal with illegal content,
including (a) a recommendation that service providers‟ abuse policies and procedures should
be easily found, clearly stated, apparent and generally consistent; (b) online takedown tools
for speedy removal that are made available and easy to find and use; (c) a recommendation
that action in response to notices should be taken in a matter of hours, not days; (d) a
recommendation that communications be sent by service providers to notice providers,
informing them when action has been taken; and (e) a system of accreditation for reputable
notice providers, who would be given priority access to the service provider‟s platform in
order to search for, identify and report illegal content, and for whom expedited action is taken
in response to notices. Accreditation should be lost or suspended in cases where notice
providers are found to have abused those privileges.
76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
We have experience in enforcing the rights of our members. We believe that the legal
framework which establishes the liability of intermediaries has created the wrong
balance. It creates incentives for intermediaries to be entirely passive so as to avoid

                                                                                               27
liability for licensing. They have no incentive to inform their customers and consumers
or to help with awareness and education of consumers. The notice and takedown system
is placing a burden on rightholders but is not operating to its full benefit. The
responsibility of other intermediaries, such as advertising or payment services, must be
more clearly defined, perhaps in the form of a joint agreement or MOU to ensure they
take an active role in preventing their services being used to support unauthorised and
illegal businesses.
Below we list a range of measures that would foster the cooperation with intermediaries:
1. „Traffic Lights’: PRS for Music proposes an industry technical solution, providing
   information on screen during search process, that would give consumers information
   about illegal sites so that they know whether a site is illegal or legal BEFORE they access
   it. Information tools should be easy to provide, they are dynamic, and they empower the
   consumer to make the right choice. EU institutions should actively support non-legislative
   solutions since they could be implemented relatively fast.
2. Enforcement: Remedies, especially injunctive relief against ISPs and site-blocking orders
   in particular, are better established in some jurisdictions than others. If there is to be
   consistent enforcement across the EU, there needs to be a focus on ensuring that action is
   possible to prevent access to infringing sites anywhere in the EU.. We note some
   remedies already available and relied by rightholders, such as site-blocking, would be
   adversely affected if there were any policy changes to rights, in particular a change to
   territoriality (country of origin) and/or changes to hyper-linking.
4. The E-Commerce Directive has given intermediaries an immunity from responsibility that
    is harmful to creators. It creates disincentives for intermediaries to assist and co-operate.
    An evaluation of the impact of the directive is desirable.
4. Other intermediaries, such as advertisers, brands, credit card companies, payment
   services, can also take action to ensure that they are not supporting illegal sites. c.f. PRS

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
 YES



    VI. A single EU Copyright Title

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 NO
                                                                                              28
79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
No, the differences between Member States‟ legislation are not problematic. The addition of a
second, parallel EU copyright title is unnecessary and would create confusion and cost.
We recognise that there may be some theoretical benefits in establishing a European copyright
code it is but not clear that it would deliver a single market in practice. The proposal is
ambitious and inherently complex and we note that attempts to develop thinking, such as the
work undertaken by the Wittem Group, have made no progress in 5 years. A single copyright
title would not per se deliver a single market to consumers. The factors that divide markets
now, such as language, or inhibit roll out of services, such as payment systems, will continue
despite changes to IP and they are the critical challenge for policy makers. Therefore, at a
time when the efforts and actions of policy makers both in the UK and across Europe are
better focussed on practical solutions, we believe the copyright code is not a priority.

VII. Other issues

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
A secure copyright regime is essential to Europe’s economic stability, future growth, and
the cultural diversity of the EU. This is because it ensures that creators are paid for the
use of their works and incentivises them to free up access to works, which in turn
stimulates innovation, investment and ultimately the creation of new works. These have
significant consumer welfare benefits.
It is therefore unfortunate that this consultation is based on a misguided assumption that
copyright is the problem for the creation of the Digital Single Market. It is not. Nor is it the
case that changes to the rights system would be in the interest of consumers or the economic
strength of the EU. Any programme which seeks to ensure a copyright framework for digital
markets must be based on two primary objectives. First, to facilitate a rights regime which
allows consumers to legally access content, when and how they want it. Secondly, and
importantly, ensure that rightholders have high protection and are fairly remunerated in a
digital market when their works are used and monetised by other providers.
In respect of the first, the current European copyright framework, because it is essentially
technology and platform neutral, has proven resilient to the development of digital technology
and services. The predictable and stable environment over the last decade has supported a
multitude of new broadcasting, online and consumer services which were almost
unimaginable when Directive 2001/29/EC was introduced in 2001. Therefore, while there is a
case for simplification of licensing, through market-led solutions support by EU and domestic
Governments, the copyright framework as a whole has proved it is not a barrier to the growth
of service providers or to the European single digital market.
However, we believe there remain significant questions as to whether the current framework
is creating sufficient value for rightholders. Real term earnings for music creators in the UK,
taking account of inflation, are in decline. While this has much to do with the falling value of
physical sales, which is not being replaced by digital, it is also a symptom of a digital
ecosystem which allows providers and intermediaries to monetise rights-protected works


                                                                                             29
without remunerating rightholders. If the EU is to continue to enjoy the benefits, in jobs and
economic growth, of a world-leading cultural sector this must be addressed.
