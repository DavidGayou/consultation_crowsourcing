Introduction
Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content  -  for information, education or entertainment purposes  -  regardless of geographical borders. 
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative framework with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now. The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact that two groups  -  user-generated content and text and data mining  -  did not reach consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.: "territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council Conclusions "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy", the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" and "Content Online". These consultations provided valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders' remuneration, particularly in the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
* Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?  
* [The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights  -  e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law. 
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet  -  e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online e-book seller  -  therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights Management should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-territorial licences in musical works for online services; the structured stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the "same" service is available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can only access their "national" service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence). 
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

[Open question]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the book sector, the issue of territoriality is fundamentally different from other sectors. The author grants a licence directly to the publisher for the commercial exploitation of a work. Publishers usually acquire and manage worldwide exclusive rights for books in a specific language (except for European publishers from English speaking countries who acquire at least pan-European licenses). For example, a Flemish publisher can sell the book in Dutch to Dutch speaking  readers all over Europe because no other publisher will get a licence for the same language. As a result, publishers can sell books through online or brick-and-mortar retailers, across the whole internal market without limitations. In unusual cases where the author has limited the publisher's right to certain territories, publishers must of course respect this choice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a small number of cases, authors may choose to limit the publisher's right to publish in certain territories. This restriction is about author freedom, and not about copyright.

Most exceptionally, some technical issues due to a very nascent e-book market (less than 2% in Belgium and a majority of EU countries) may make it necessary to limit the licence to some regions, however this is not the rule and very rarely occurs in the digital book sector. In anticipation of forthcoming new VAT rules which foresee that from January 2015 VAT should be collected in the country of consumption, we foresee some difficulties due to the need to identify where the sale will take place. The publishers are willing to work together with booksellers on this issue and wish to gain the Commission's support for this challenging transition. Another factor is related to forum shopping for legislation when it comes to defamation. An improvement of the Rome II regulation would be helpful in that respect. Please see the publishers' commitment in the framework of Licences of Europe: https://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/sites/licences-for-europe-dialogue/files/2-E-books-roadmap_0.pdf

We do not expect particular legislative measures in the copyright field to be required at EU level to increase cross-border availability of books in analogue and digital formats within the single market. However, we would like to encourage the Commission to support us in finding technical solutions to identify the country of sale for VAT purposes (see question 5), to enhance the discoverability of e-books and also with regard to the interoperability of devices, platforms and content.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
* [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of software and databases.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.  
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the making of copies, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission  -  e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available  -  and at the users' end  -  e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.
The act of "making available" 
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of "making available" takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the "targeting" of a certain Member State's public. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are "targeted" by the online service provider. A service provider "targets" a group of customers residing in a specific country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations  -  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  -  sufficiently clear? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application of the country of origin principle would have a negative effect on the ability of rightsholders to effectively enforce their "making available" or any other exclusive rights of copyright. The making available right is most useful when an infringement can be brought against a party who does not make an unauthorised reproduction in a particular territory (but very often) has done so or assisted or facilitated the making of a copy in another jurisdiction. The making available right is also useful in that the exceptions from copyright infringement in relation to the reproduction right are not co-extensive with the exceptions from infringement relating to the making available right. There is no justification for changing this, and doing so would make it harder for rightsholders to enforce their rights.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)

[In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?

We do not believe a clarification of the territorial scope of the making available needs clarification. The "lex loci protectionis" conflict of law rule for copyright provides adequate means to enforce copyright. For criminal matters, a greater cooperation in the Internal Market would be helpful.

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation 
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different persons/entities. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

This is not applicable to the print sector where publishers generally acquire all rights which are fully transferred to him/her by the author(s) for commercial exploitation. Publishers hold rights for reproduction and distribution. We therefore do not see any need for legislation in that respect as in our field the two distinct rights do not create any problem.

Linking and browsing 
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are pending before the CJEU in which the question has been raised whether the provision of a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder. 
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public  -  or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hyperlink per say should not be considered as making available when the link leads to an authorised copy of a work or other subject matter. They therefore should not be subject to the prior approval provided that the rightholder is entitled to set restrictions on access to the materials at the end of the link. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, links should be covered by the making available right in cases where:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- the link leads to illegally made available material
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- the link leads to copyright material not previously made available to the public, as it is with pirate sites offering link collections
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- it is a deep link leading directly to the content
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automated restrictions on access such as prohibitions on crawling must be followed by search engines, or the search engines will be deemed infringers and/or contributory infringers.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user's computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The actual viewing of a page (from a user's perspective) should not be subject to authorisation when it involves truly an act of temporary reproduction as a necessary technical process.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, the making available of copyright protected content on a webpage so that internet users can view it can and should only be done under authorisation of rightholders. Illegal display of pdf on websites and illegal streaming constitutes an increasing form of piracy of e-books, which becomes even more crucial at a time when services are being created where a book can be accessed on subscription basis. Moreover, rightholders should be able to decide whether a work is available for indexing by search engines.

Download to own digital content 
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article). The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy). This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have "re-sold" it  -  this is often referred to as the "forward and delete" question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

[In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As recognised in this consultation, the ability to resell of previously purchased digital content would have severe economic implications on the book sector. Applying the principle of exhaustion to digital products would also stymie the development of new business models and it is hard to foresee that the exhaustion rule applied to electronic content would be compliant with the three-step-test of the Berne convention. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are several reasons why the conditions and approaches which apply with regard to physical goods should not also obtain in the digital marketplace. The simple assumption that because a certain approach works for physical it should, almost axiomatically, be made to apply to digital is overly simplistic. The attempt to straightforwardly transplant physical terms to the digital market ignores hugely significant key differences between how the markets operate. Ignoring these differences places the strength of the creative economy in jeopardy, in that creators' rewards and incentives would be eroded, along with the incentives and abilities of creative companies to invest in them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The underlying philosophy of the copyright framework is to give the author exclusive rights in the first-hand market, because this is where the greatest value can be derived and where they are likely to maximise their reward. It also ensures that their moral rights are maintained.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the physical domain, it follows that it can be tolerated for the author not to also have full exclusive rights in the second-hand market: specifically the exhaustion of the distribution right can be tolerated as the author is deemed to have earned sufficient reward in his first-hand market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, this logic is drastically changed in the digital world because here the second-hand market is largely indistinguishable from the first-hand, owing to three vital characteristics of digital goods.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Digital works in the second-hand market are identical to the original of the work only in the sense that they contain the same work; however, physical works in the second-hand market are identical in the strictest interpretation of the term "identical": i.e. the second-hand work is one and the same thing as the first-hand work.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Digital copies can be numerous, to a near-infinite degree, and therefore the second-hand market can be bigger than the first-hand market. In the physical world, this is impossible since the second-hand market can only ever be as big as the first-hand market and is always likely to actually be smaller. Given the trivial ease with which Digital Rights Management tools can be hacked and cracked, it is no comfort to say that "forward and delete" approach could solve this issue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) From these two points it follows that whereas digital copies are and remain pristine and faithful, physical copies suffer from deterioration. This means that goods in the physical second-hand market are inferior to the first-hand (increasingly so over time) and so goods in each market are less substitutable. For example, a dog-eared copy of "The Da Vinci Code" on its fourth outing on the shelves of a charity shop is clearly inferior to the brand new copy in a high street bookshop.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The upshot of these three factors is that the ability of the author/publisher to earn just reward in the first-hand market would be severely curtailed by the untrammelled reselling of digital content. They would face unfair competition from the second-hand market, in which the providers of goods have borne none of the risk of investment in the creation of the product, nor have borne any of the production costs, other than the trivial cost of reproduction. This would generate unfair price competition to the distinct disadvantage of the first-hand market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Furthermore, the impact on levels of online copyright infringement would be likely to be significant. Monitoring unauthorised distribution is difficult enough in the prevailing conditions; however, it would become untenable to monitor and track infringement in a newly legitimised second-hand market in which there was no discernible difference in the product. Pirate copies would be indistinguishable from the legitimate copies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further, it is more difficult to determine whether a digital good has been sold; unlike a physical sale where there is a transfer to another user and the denial of the continuing use of the physical good by the seller, in the digital environment this is not the case  -  both the seller and purchaser can continue to use the digital product. The implications for widespread copyright infringement  -  and concurrent difficulties in enforcement  -  are clear.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nor is there a significant consumer loss if the sale of digital second-hand books remains prohibited. First, because the on-going sale of second-hand physical books would be in no way affected; secondly, because there is no clear discernible potential value to the consumer of selling second-hand ebooks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a further potential for harm to the consumer. A rational response from authors/publishers to the challenge of lost value in the second-hand market would be to raise prices in the first-hand market in order to cover anticipated losses. This would be a perilous strategy as it would entail losing further market share to lower prices in the second-hand market. It would also impose higher prices on those consumers who wanted first-hand works.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This idea is also based on a wide-spread false apprehension of the fact that e-books are cheaper than paper books. E-books are in fact not much cheaper to produce than print books; we estimate that digital production allows savings of about 15-20% (printing, storage and distribution)  -  everything else (paying authors, editorial, marketing, etc) is still there in digital. In any event, only a tiny marginal proportion of publishers only publish ebooks, almost all publishers need to publish in paper and in digital form, so the reduction of costs, for a market that is no more than 1% in the majority of Member States is not significant at all (the UK is an exception with 15% market share of e-books, France, Italy, Spain and Germany between 2 to 3% but most of the countries across the EU, amongst which Belgium, are counting 1% or even less). Moreover, the digital market is still so nascent that there are still big initial investments needed to move to digital. So all in all for the time being producing ebooks costs about the same, if not more. Please refer to the Annex I at the end of the document on the "Contribution on the book sector by the Federation of European Publishers to the OHIM strategic report on legal offers available online".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So for these reasons it has to be clearly acknowledged that the digital marketplace is importantly different to the physical one.
Registration of works and other subject matter  -  is it a good idea? 
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being considered.  
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of works and other subject matter? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The book publishing sector already has a registration system for the identification of books (ISBN), works (ISTC), and party names (ISNI), which is what is needed to help in the identification also for licencing purposes (cf. The LCC Principles of Identification v1.0​​​, www.linkedcontentcoalition.org/home_page.html#!documents/cvjv).. The book industry was the first cultural sector to create an international standard to identify a books with the ISBN, which was introduced in 1965 and now applies also to e-books and educational software. This is a system of registration indispensable to the book value chain. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
European publishers do not believe that any additional system of registration needs to be created and applied to the publishing sector.  We also reject the notion that registration should be a prerequisite for the protection and exercise of rights. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The new environment is challenging in this area, since it requires standards for identification, description (to facilitate retrieval in the Internet) and formats, to ensure interoperability between different devices. European publishers are actively committed to the development of open standards along the production chain, including identification (ISBN, ISTC), metadata (ONIX), web resolution (DOI) and  -  very important for e-book portability  -  digital format (.epub). Dialogue with other players along the book value chain will be essential for full deployment of such standards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The identification and licensing of works and other subject matter is better served by improvements in facilitating discoverability; and in the streamlining of licensing.  Publishers are working to improve both of these, at national and European level.

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers, collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed `identifiers'. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are specific to the sector in which they have been developed, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database should, once operational, provide a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition was established to develop building blocks for the expression and management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM)  -  a comprehensive data model for all types of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub is seeking to take such identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across different sectors. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Via the Federation of European Publishers we support the Linked Content Coalition (LCC) and its valuable work to create tools for right information management in any licensing activity. We also believe in the development of systems like the UK Copyright Hub and think that, while respecting national preferences in adopting such models, the EU may contribute through encouraging possible pan-European application or interlinking with other similar initiatives. A significant first initiative to implement the LCC framework is Rights Data Integration, which develops concrete use cases in the book sector.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are  -  via the Flemish sector organisation Boek.be  -  also actively involved in ARROW, which is a tool to facilitate rights information management in any digitisation project involving text and image based works. The ARROW Rights Information Infrastructure is based on standard identification systems to support the process of identification of authors, publishers and other right holders of a work, including determining whether it is orphan, in or out of copyright or its commercial availability status. In this, it is based on the same principle as LCC.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe that supporting technological and business innovation in this field is a much more effective policy than introducing new pieces of legislation. In particular, registration systems in the field should remain voluntary and independent (self-regulating) since they demonstrated over the time to be more efficient.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We support the views of the Federation of European Publishers which actively took part in Working Group 2 within "Licenses for Europe", especially with regard to the micro-licensing strand (previously small scale users) and signed a toolkit for licensing including micro-licensing for the text and image sector. In this context, we encourage both: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Solutions for the identification of authors and publishers, their agents or other representatives (such as CMOs) from whom permission can be sought;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Solutions to give users information about licensing and licensing conditions: how the licensing process works and what users can do with a work under a chosen licence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Term of protection  -  is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US). 

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of protection. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe the current terms of copyright are still appropriate. Book publishers do not benefit from a copyright term of protection but acquire rights from their author(s) for a certain period or the length of the author copyright term. The author(s) in turn receive(s) royalties for the exploitation of his (their) work. Intellectual property is a fundamental right which like other property should be passed to the owner's heirs, at least for one generation and there is no reason, be economic or philosophical, to deprive an author from this right in the digital environment. This is based on a false assumption that the creativity input and dissemination effort would be less in the digital context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A reduction of the term of protection could also be detrimental to the exploitation of a work as often authors need to wait for the publication of more than one work before achieving commercial success, or often gain broader audiences at a later stage, e.g. after an on screen adaptation of their book takes place.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authors and their publishers must be able to enjoy return on investment, which the current term of protection provides. For example, the "Le Petit Prince" (The Little Prince) by Antoine de Saint Exupéry benefits from 88 years protection after his death, because he died for France in the war. This regime is justified, as every year, numerous new creations are drawn from his work, benefiting his heirs.

Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC. 
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international law. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders. 
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level), these limitations and exceptions are often optional, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market. 
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member State "B"). 
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member States' regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.............................................................................................................
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.............................................................................................................
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We do not see any specific problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions are optional for the Member States. There is no reason to distinguish amongst them and make some of them "compulsory". Exceptions for public interest are implemented in virtually all Member States, amongst which Belgium, and the system of optional exceptions allows the flexibility required by differences in national culture and traditions. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reason why Directive 2001/29/EC does not provide an exhaustive list of mandatory exceptions is because Europe had to take into account the cultural traditions of 15 different Member States (now it would be 28) and the discussions on the Copyright Directive generated unprecedented debate. Notwithstanding this fact, differences between national copyright laws do not represent an obstacle to the creation of an online market for the publishing sector which is healthy and thriving. In fact, publishers themselves frequently rely on exceptions such as quotation in one member state for the exploitation of a work across the EU. Indeed, the sector is hampered more by factors such as labour laws or lack of harmonisation of taxation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instead, the real obstacle to the online market is the threat of illegal downloading which prevents legal offers from being marketed on a level playing-field. We would need to see evidence that a harmonised set of exceptions would bring proven benefit without harming the current publishing market
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As explained in question 21, we disagree with the idea that some or all exceptions should be made mandatory. The fact that they are optional leaves room for the right amount of flexibility so needed in a fast changing environment. Conditions of use of right are better served both for the users and the rightholders when handled through licence agreements, which add to the flexibility and enable to serve uses across borders if needed. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We do not see the need to add new exceptions to the existing catalogue. Any new exception should answer a market failure and the inability to serve users with licencing solutions. The exercise of "Licences for Europe", in which the Federation of European Publishers actively participated, shows that licences are well suited to catering to user demand.  Licenses are the most flexible instrument available in order to meet each user's individual needs in the relevant use case. New exceptions set prematurely in a fast moving world where technologies evolve very rapidly would certainly stifle business innovation and the ability of publishers to develop offers to serve new needs. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain why 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.............................................................................................................
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.............................................................................................................
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current 20 optional exceptions with broad scope and wording are meant to offer the necessary flexibility, balanced with legal certainty. We do not believe that broader wording of exceptions would serve the purpose of better harmonisation. Yet more flexibility would lead to legal uncertainty for both rightholders and users. Publishers invest in content and increasingly licence it for digital transmissions. As responsible economic actors of Europe's cultural influence, we need to be able to rely on a firm set of rules to provide the EU with economic weapons on this strategic field of world influence. We believe it is currently in place in the 2001 Copyright Directive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
National courts and the ECJ already play a central role in the legal interpretation of exceptions. However, introducing more flexibility and especially a general rule such as Fair Use into the EC legal system would only bring huge legal uncertainty, thereby challenging the ability of publishers to conduct business. It would probably be the most efficient way of destroying the value of EU cultural businesses and of reinforcing non-EU economic actors' influence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fair Use in the U.S. provides a statutory defence mechanism to what could actually be infringement of exclusive copyright. This effectively means that rightholders are forced to challenge uses in court after the event. The test is based on a century of U.S.-jurisprudence and this jurisprudence would not be readily available to the legal framework in Europe - indeed it would impose an unreasonably heavy burden of interpretation on EU courts as they struggle to reconcile two such dramatically different regimes. Interestingly, the US Copyright Office states on their website that the safest option for prospective users of content is to get clearance and that if there is any doubt, it is advisable to consult a lawyer. Ultimately, the Fair Use principle entails being able to pay lawyers' fees. In addition, users will lose legal certainty as the whole system will be far more dependent on the circumstances of each case. Cases such as the Google Book Settlement illustrate how big commercial players can exploit the legal uncertainty around the US doctrine to economically exhaust rights holders, who are often not big players, and who therefore cannot afford expensive litigation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There seems to be a contradiction in calling for more harmonisation and mandatory exceptions and at the same time calling for more flexibility. We believe that there is currently flexibility in the EU copyright system thanks to the freedom left to Member States when transposing the EU copyright framework.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any further legislation, however technology neutral, runs the risk of being too closely tailored to business models and technologies of its day rather than allowing for future developments. In contrast, licences are by far the quickest, most flexible and most effective way of achieving technology neutral and targeted solutions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility?

Publishers frequently rely on exceptions, e.g. for quotations in one member state, for works exploited across the EU..

Anyway, when possible, publishers favour licences which are flexible and balanced. Licences foresee uses across borders and can, unlike legislation, rapidly adapt to changing environments. The main issues with territoriality are addressed in the following questions of this consultation. Again, licenses are the mechanism best suited to addressing them.

In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of "fair compensation" be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the core of the problem from our point of view. In the current economic setting and with budget cuts occurring in all EU Member States, especially in the areas of culture and education, we do not believe that public authorities would be willing to compensate exceptions with cross-border effects if that meant spending taxpayers' money on benefitting tax-payers in another Member State. This would especially affect uses of works in widely read languages such as English, but also French, German or Spanish and Italian. Licenced solutions are acceptable in closed networks of schools, universities or libraries, but if exceptions allowed uses involving communicating content on the internet (having potentially wide cross-border effects), it would be difficult, if not impossible, to compensate in a fair and balanced manner. It should also be remembered that Member States also have very distinct and separate systems for fair compensation, for example levies, which are not present in other Member States  -  and are unlikely ever to be introduced.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and archiving and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject matter in the collections of such institutions. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here. 
* Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films)  -  the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

We are not aware of any problems in this area. However, we are aware of some public libraries are requesting to be able to engage in certain preservation activities despite the fact that they are not heritage libraries. We believe that heritage libraries including national libraries have an essential task of comprehensive preservation of cultural heritage. However this mandate does not extend to all libraries. A distinction could be therefore drawn in the definition of the type of establishment to clarify who is responsible for long term preservation and can therefore benefit from a certain exception. This being said, legal deposit is dealt with at national level as every country has its own definition of cultural heritage. Therefore, there should not be any European harmonisation on legal deposit schemes.

Not all libraries need to preserve their collections. Where paper books are concerned, public libraries review their collections after certain periods, discarding some of their holdings. European publishers are in discussion with heritage libraries to find the most appropriate solutions to their specific needs. Since 1996, European publishers are also engaged in a joint Committee with the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL) to develop guidelines for a system of voluntary "legal deposit" for offline and online works. The scheme is voluntary and aims to help all national libraries, while taking into account each country's individual concept of national heritage.

Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We do not believe that the two conditions of "dedicated terminals" and "physical premises" can be removed under an exception without endangering the commercial market, however, rightholders should be free to allow this under licences.

We believe that licensing should be encouraged. Any library exception allowing making available online would only create unfair competition with business models, and be contrary to the 3 step test.

E  -  lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

Publishers believe that libraries have an important mission in giving access to books to the wider public in the digital world. In this context, licensing solutions are being developed in all Member States enabling the development of the market. Each licensing model has its own terms and is negotiated between rightholders and libraries. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A certain degree of competition between library lending and sales of e-books is inevitable. Remote borrowing services and the fact that digital files do not deteriorate with multiple "loans", mean that this degree of competition is higher than is the case with physical books. It is also important to realise that library acquisitions make for only about 4 % of publishers' turnover at the very best (5% in the UK, 4-5% in France, but less than 2% in Italy, less than 1% in Spain). This illustrates why it is necessary to find balanced ways to sustain the commercial market which represents 96%, for most cases 98-99%. In Sweden, where libraries are only purchasing 3-4% of all books sold, they are taking up to 90% of the e-book market and next to 10% in Denmark. Any exception in this area would jeopardise this balance and would put a stop to the development of regular e-book sales through bookshops and online retailers as well as new innovative services such as Izneo (French and Belgian rental service of comic e-books) or new digital services that are being developed such as a Belgian service for the streaming of e-books.

 [Open question]

Any perceived problems can be solved by encouraging licensing and sharing best practices, but not by creating legislation which would prejudice commercial exploitation of books and inhibit the launch of new service and technical and business innovation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see between libraries' traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As stated above, libraries remain essential institutions for readers and are a relevant part of the book world including with the digital evolutions. We acknowledge their request to shift their traditional activities of on-premises and public lending towards online developments. However, we should be cautious that any move forward by libraries will not jeopardise a nascent e-book market. If all or a majority of library services were to be offered online, there would be no more reason to maintain local libraries, as a single central service would be sufficient. The distinction between their mission of consultation and public lending right, which tends to blur when considered online, should be maintained with "frictions" in order to preserve the commercial market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Publishers are increasingly developing innovative and accessible licences to allow a high level of granularity in giving users the appropriate licences for their individual needs. There are strong economic arguments in favour of maintaining some form of limitation to electronic "lending" in the online environment which make the library patron's experience comparable to borrowing a physical book. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We would like to refer in that respect to the example of Denmark, where a very permissive lending system called eReolen was launched, showed that whereas e-lending rose exponentially, the nascent market of e-books came to a complete standstill at during the lending period. Moreover, most of the pirated books to be found online came from eReolen, which as a consequence shifted to a streaming system. The digital market is in its earliest stages, and no one can predict its development at this stage. We need therefore to be prudent and make sure not to freeze specific business models in time by way of legislation. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, a distinction should be made between academic and public libraries. Sales to consumers represent the majority of the trade book market. When it comes to a public library, we can imagine that by making works available online, libraries compete with online commercial exploitation of works by offering a substitute of access to a work. The balance with the commercial offer is all the more difficult to find, this is why we need "frictions". The fine line with e-lending is also blurred. In the off-line world, the friction is either the fact that you need to go to the premises to access a work in any event, be for a on premises consultation or be to borrow and bring a book home with you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Mass digitisation
The term "mass digitisation" is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.  Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20[th] century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing authors and publishers on the other. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting society or the recognition of an "extended effect" to the licences granted). 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In France and Germany, authors, publishers and libraries have negotiated solutions for out of commerce works (oeuvres indisponibles in French) before those being codified in the law. The important element is that they have been negotiations which allow to tailor the solution to the needs of the libraries, to provide a fair remuneration for the rights holders and a possibility to remove their works to either bring them back into the market or to respect the moral rights of the authors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Successful projects have been conducted in dialogues with the authors and publishers' associations and their collective management organisations and demonstrate that when there is a political willingness and good will from all sides, solutions can be brought to the fore.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In those countries, the implementation of the MoU on out of commerce works signed by FEP, EWC, STM, IFRRO and library representatives, has thus required the adoption of legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of the voluntarily negotiated licences. However, if Member States implement the MOU across the EU following all of its conditions, we do not believe that any further legislation is needed at European level.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike the Google Book Settlement, the MoU on out of commerce works foresees some safeguards when rightholders are not represented. It is up to Member States to decide according to their legal tradition whether further national legislation is needed. Signatories have created OMIT (Out-of-Commerce MoU Implementation Task Force) and meet very regularly to take stock of libraries projects across the EU and monitor implementation of the MoU. What was found by the group is that by large it is not copyright which prevents digitisation projects but a lack of public funding. In France and Germany where the MoU was successfully implemented, financial mechanism and public money was available to make those projects come to life.

Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

Publishers are developing innovative offers in the field of educational publishing, including digital uses of educational material for example for display on interactive white boards or available through virtual learning environments. Educational publishers are also increasingly licencing modules and parts of books, as well as whole works. Publishers are in the business of tailoring their offerings to meet user needs, and these offers are increasingly available on a cross-border basis.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Publishers are quite proactive in offering their books in paper and digital formats to educational establishments. In Belgium, educational publishers have been proposing most of their works in both digital and printed formats  accessible via a single portal, Knooppunt/Digiportail, which allow teachers (or parents) to consult and use these resources.

What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Book publishing entered the digital age many years ago. First, ICT was integrated in the production processes, and more recently, technological developments have allowed reaching out to readers with digital products. Educational publishers are no exception to this; it is in the nature of their business to meet the needs of their users, and thus they have been producing and making available digital learning materials for a number of years. All major educational publishing houses in the EU have nowadays the capacity to provide content in digital formats and the capital and management skills to develop special software or applications. Also small and medium sized publishers are often innovative in the field. For example, in Italy 95% of new textbooks produced in 2011 were issued linked to web-based resources (test, demo, short movies, images, simulation, virtual environment, etc.).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Educational publishing represents a strategic part of the trade book publishing market which cannot afford to be put at risk by a broad exception. A vibrant educational publishing industry is a guarantee of freedom of expression and plurality of views and economic independence and prosperity. Educational publishing is a very important component of the publishing industry, representing 35% of the market in Flanders. If scholarly and professional publishing were added (34% of the total internal market), the share of the market would be close to 70% if educational publishing were jeopardised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Publishers serve a wide range of markets related to education, at different levels and with very different implications in terms of sector dynamics. A basic distinction can be made by identifying the following areas:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Primary and secondary education: school education, usually the free, mandatory part of education. Publishers produce textbooks that implement national and sometimes even regional curricula, designed by Member States in application of their exclusive competences, addressing the needs of specific age classes and often closely linked to a country's history and culture; they are bought by parents or public authorities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  Educational consumer market: complementary material for primary and secondary level students (`after school' market). Publishers offer additional materials to complement that in use in schools; they are usually bought by parents.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Higher education: post-secondary education, university (undergraduate and graduate). Publishers produce academic books that students use as a complement to their courses; they are bought by students or university libraries.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Vocational training (initial and adult) and lifelong learning: education that prepares people for specific trades, crafts and careers, or the on-going, voluntary, and self-motivated pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons. Publishers offer a range of books and materials for all kinds of needs; they are bought by users or training institutions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Scientific or academic communication: scholarly communication based on research. Publishers produce materials that are usually written by scholars and for scholars; they are normally acquired by university libraries, commercial companies (e.g. pharmaceutical) and interested laymen, offered in a broad variety of business models, including open access.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Publishers hold the intellectual property rights on the books they produce for the educational systems, having acquired from creators and/or intermediaries the relevant IP rights in the several pieces of content included in any textbook.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We would like to remind the Commission of the central role of high quality educational resources, whether paper or digital ones, for knowledge dissemination, effective learning processes and for the success of each student in application of the equality principle. The issue of learning tools should be addressed by referring to pedagogy issues and the aims that such tools should contribute to achieve, thus bearing in mind also the importance of the classroom environment for learning. Educational outcomes should be the first and foremost concern when considering initiatives affecting the educational sector.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to improve access to the content we publish, the best way forward is through licensing either through individual licenses or through voluntary agreements with collective management organisations. Educational institutions, students, teachers and society at large need good local educational resources. Flourishing local cultural industries and a healthy educational system with broad access also to local resources contribute significantly to a country's economy and employment. Where access to works based on individual and collective licensing is stimulated, there are increased opportunities for local authors to create good works and for local publishers to invest. This helps to build a sustainable national creative industry and a range of teaching materials adapted to local and special user needs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All Member States, including Belgium, have exceptions allowing for the illustration of teaching which publishers complete by developing innovative offers in the field of educational publishing, now including digital uses of educational material for example for white boards. A distinction has to be made between primary and secondary teaching which is national and higher education where publishers licence the use in intranets. Educational publications are nowadays coming together with versatile and flexible mechanisms, which can also de facto be made accessible cross-border. However, so far such cross-border needs have never been reported to publishers in primary and secondary education, because of the national nature of curricula, and thus of the demand of educational content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Educational publishers are also increasingly licensing modules and parts of books, rather than the entire book. Studies show that schools and universities tend to make particularly intensive use of works of school books and text books, i.e. those works whose primary (and only) market is directly affected by those uses. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Knooppunt (www.knooppunt.net) in Flanders and Digiportail (www.digiportail.be) in Wallonia are platforms developed by Belgian (Flemish) educational publishers; one platform gives access to all (mostly paid-for) digital material from all educational publishers, with no visible complexity for students and teachers. The use of the platform is for free and it provides a helpdesk; different materials are available for teachers and students: manuals, online magazines, interactive exercises, films, audio, games, digital whiteboard products, for a total of some 2,300 products, mainly aimed at secondary schools but also primary school and higher education. The basic concepts behind the project and its future developments are: evolving with a speed workable for its users (also not producing materials for which there is no infrastructure in schools or no training available for teachers); being accessible and understandable for all users; offering quality content (indeed allowing publishers to compete on quality, not on technology or infrastructure).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no barrier to the provision of digital material for illustration for teaching, as the above indicates.

It is not clear that there is any problem that requires a solution. There is no evidence that a harmonised compulsory broader exception would not harm the market, nor is there evidence of a market failure where some learning needs are not being catered for. Current exceptions are broad enough to allow a lot of uses, and licences complement these by allowing more, including cross border uses. Instead, Member States should be encouraged to maintain adequate budgets for education, including the acquisition of educational resources, both physical and  -  where possible  -  digital.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We also need the Commission to ensure that interoperability is a criterion in public procurement, when providing for e-reading and/or e-readers material at school. There is a great need for a European policy of development of interoperability, standards and indexation. This would avoid the locking up of markets and the creation of dominant positions (for example on behalf of providers of technological solutions or internet access).

European publishers are satisfied with the current exception and are not aware of specific issues. Content for research purposes falls either under the exceptions or is licenced (90% of scientific technical and medical publishing content is licenced in digital form). New licensing solutions going beyond the research exceptions are being developed. In this context we refer to initiatives like RightsLink (http://www.mvb-rightslink.com) or Conlicencia (www.conlicencia.com).

Disabilities 
Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and facilitating their distribution across the European Union) . 
The Marrakesh Treaty has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

Agreements between rightholders and trusted intermediaries are very important beyond the mere application of limitations or exceptions to facilitate the production of special formats, when needed, so to have accessible copies of books. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Belgium, publishers collaborate with institutions supporting disabled through providing them the original files for the requested books (e.g. Adibib and Luisterpunt), which result in a decrease of the production costs of special formats. We believe that projects such as ETIN, the European Trusted Intermediaries Network, which suffers from lack of finances, is very valuable to overcome any technical or practical hurdles.

What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content? How successful are they?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Myriad mechanisms exist in the market to facilitate accessibility to content. Publishers are increasingly publishing books in ePub3 format which incorporate the specification for accessibility outlined by the Daisy consortium and can therefore be made easily accessible for visually impaired people. Such files enable changes to colour, font, spacing etc, to assist the print impaired, and also reduce the number of cases in which unadapted files need to be converted under exception.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Italian project LIA  -  Libri Italiani Accessibili, demonstrated how much technological innovation can help in reaching the objectives of the Digital Agenda for Europe in this field (Pilar VI, Action 65) in allowing visually impaired people to access the books at the same time and with the same quality of sighted readers  -  and without the need for an exception. The LIA platform was launched in July 2013 and already reached the result of having c.ca 35% of the e-books produced in the country fully accessible at the time of publication. Furthermore, the visually impaired can access the same information about book production, enjoy the same search tools available for other readers, select and buy their preferred books in their preferred shop, and borrow the books in a library thanks to the collaboration between two e-lending platforms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition individual member state initiatives, projects such as ETIN or TIGAR continue to facilitate access to backlist titles or to titles not published in e-book format. In any event, we wish that commercial availability remains prevalent over the exceptions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics are different terms used to describe increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.  
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without restrictions on the internet, open access). 
Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain "access" to content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases). 
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe". In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

For the time being, TDM requests are still very limited although they are expected to grow steadily in the coming years. For non-commercial researchers wanting to mine the articles and data contained in published journals and books for which they have a subscription, STM publishers have committed to provide licenses under standard terms at no additional cost. The commitment has been made in the framework of L4E. Obviously the circumstances are very different when one deals with commercial players who will mine content and data for their own commercial purposes and one should beware of piracy and parasitism risks. Yet, publishers are very willing to allow them to mine their publications provided that this is dealt with under licensing terms.

Yes, the protection of data privacy, if one was to mine content one can find openly on the internet. Competition issues such as the one related to remedies provided by search engine in scrapping the internet and re-using the content, including when it does not come from a page that opted-out but from another illegal content (pirate site). TDM may also imply that the publisher may set up a specific technical environment, such as an API, where the researcher may download the content before mining it, which is not cost-free. An exception would not be helpful at all to manage such technical issues.

User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the making of so-called "user-generated content". While users can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not "new" as such. However, the development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across different sectors as a result of the "Licences for Europe" discussions.

There is no evidence of a problem that has not already been solved  -  or could not be solved  -  by licensing. Publishers are developing click-through seamless micro-licensing system for cases that go beyond the quotation exceptions. We believe that licencing schemes could also be put in place with blogs or platforms hosting text and images, as has worked well with YouTube for the music and AV sectors. "Non-commercial" transformative uses are often commercial in the sense that they generate advertising revenue for the platforms on which they are published.

Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and photocopying. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers' licence fees. 
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

When a use is permitted by law and impacts a rightholder in our sector, it requires remuneration, and levies are one of the ways to remunerate. But no exception may prejudice the normal exploitation of a work, even when compensated by a levy. Current levy systems, where in place, have their own merits and are one of the ways to foresee the compensation for private copying and reprography. In most cases, publishers are perfectly satisfied with their collective management organisations and the levy system in place. However, some countries chose not to have levy systems and this should be respected. Indeed, every country deals with its situation within a national and cultural context which cannot be exported to the rest of Europe on an arbitrary basis. We therefore do not believe that there is currently a need to harmonise further the functioning of the levy systems. In particular, it must continue to be a requirement that certain exceptions are only permissible if fair compensation is provided to the rightholders. Rightholders eligible for a fair compensation comprise both the authors and the publishers.

How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing  allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders' revenue on the other? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Private copies made purely for the purposes of back up and not linked to any online service are of a different order to private copies which are transferred to the cloud and can therefore be used in online services. Therefore it is not necessarily the case that the same compensation mechanisms should apply in both cases. Thanks to licences, cloud services can allow copying of books to a certain extent, so as to access them on different media. However, private copying of entire books and putting them on the cloud without a licence is not private copy but an illegal act.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments.

Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from authors or performers to producers or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different sectors of the creative industries. 
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.  Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

Publishers are naturally very much in favour of a fair remuneration of their authors. Ensuring this is a vital part of their core mission. Authors are associated to the success of their work, they usually receive an advance to complete their work and then royalties proportionate to the sale of their work. There are only exceptionally situations of buy-out clause and lump sum as it is the case with performers and audiovisual authors. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contracts in publishing are based on individual negotiations. Collective author agreements are not practiced in the book publishing sector. Moreover, collecting societies do not play the same role as in the other sectors. As mentioned above, collecting societies (the RROs) only manage secondary rights and authors and publishers are both members of the same collecting societies. Therefore a solution based on an unwaivable equitable remuneration right managed by a CMO would not apply to the publishing sector. If publishing companies were no longer directly financially involved in the exploitation of their books, they would have fewer incentives to invest in promoting new authors and to innovate through new concepts, to the detriment of cultural diversity.

Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this text. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial purpose. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure. At the same time, there could be clarification of the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe that the current EU legal system framed by the 2006 Enforcement Directive is satisfactory, although some things can be done, namely to improve the civil enforcement system across the EU. We refer to the answer by the Federation of European Publishers to the Commission's public consultation on the "efficiency of proceedings and accessibility of measures." 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Enforcement Directive has broadly provided a harmonised framework of enforcement rules, but these still diverge in practice, as some Member States failed to implement some of the provisions correctly. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of the internet has created new ways to infringe copyright, which was not envisaged when the Enforcement Directive was discussed and adopted.  We welcome the recognition by the Commission that some aspects of the Directive could therefore be improved to better reflect the needs of the market in these changed circumstances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specifically, the Enforcement Directive needs to extend the presumption of ownership to holders of exclusive licenses or to assignees of copyright owners, as the findings of the staff working paper also point out. Publishers do not benefit from a "related right", in the same way producers of sound recordings or films do as holders to the "related right", which results in publishers lacking "locus standi". However, structurally, it is rarely the author but mostly the publisher that will have the resources to take legal action but most of the time they waste time and resources in proving ownership.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The distinction between commercial and non-commercial is an unclear one, as most of the "non-commercial" exchange website benefit from advertisement revenue and, although this is difficult to measure, file exchange and download do represent a loss sale. However, the position of European publishers is not to go after individuals but rather after the source where the illegal websites are originating.

In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough to allow for  sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some clarification would be welcome when it comes to the involvement of intermediaries. We understand that there is no political will to reopen the e-commerce directive and we support this. However, we need to have a clear legal framework on which intermediary is concerned as one under the E-commerce Directive. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are of the opinion that search engines - which enable the indexation of file-sharing websites, host or facilitate the distribution of pirated content - should contribute to reducing online copyright infringement through preventive measures such as preventing suggested automatic searches to suggest illegal search and through responding efficiently to `notice and take down' notifications. The cooperation of ISPs is of primary importance in securing better respect for intellectual property rights online. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISPs provide access to the Internet and interconnect the underlying networks, host websites and servers. It would be useful to "clarify [that] injunctions should not depend on the liability of the intermediaries", and that the notion of liability of ISPs is clarified when they can have several functions (hosting or editing).  ISPs have a responsibility to assist in tackling copyright infringement online, regardless of their accountability for the content itself. There is limited capacity in the national courts (as well as the limitation of rightholders' time and money) to bring the number of actions against infringers necessary to curb infringement.  Besides, notice and take down procedures should be simplified. Indeed the main problem arises from the difficulty to gather all the elements necessary for the notice and in particular to determine who the publisher of the website is, so as to send him the notice as the same time as to the ISP. Publishers have always put forward solutions based on dialogue and strongly regrets that ISPs have walk away from the dialogue on illegal up-and-download in 2010 and facilitated by the European Commission.  We would like to be able to continue working in this voluntary way with ISPs, in order to come to workable solutions to tackling online copyright infringement.

Of course data privacy rules are capital to the respect of European citizens' right to privacy, however, they should not act as a shield to illegal activities. Instruments such as the Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EC) are essential to provide rightholders with the means to fight against piracy i.e. article 8 on the right to obtain information about infringements and infringers. The 2006 Data Retention Directive (2006/24/EC) requires ISPs to store data and communicate it to relevant authorities. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite the ECJ's clarification in the two rulings Promusicae in 2008 (C-275/06) and Tele 2 (C-557/07), there remains some uncertainty about whether EU law presents an obstacle to the applications of article 8 of the Enforcement directive.  The second ruling referred to the first and states that a Member State can prescribe an obligation to disclose personal data to private third parties to ensure that these can take legal action in a civil case relating to breach of copyright. The Swedish Supreme court asked for a preliminary ruling to know whether provisions relating to discovery orders are compatible with the Data protection Directive. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One non-legislative solution could be to adapt contractual practices of ISPs to facilitate the transmission of data to rightholders. Currently, it is very challenging in most countries for publishers to face time-consuming and expensive court procedures every time their intellectual property rights are infringed online.

A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States' legal systems.

Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We do not believe that a single EU Copyright title will bring any benefits to the development of content online, which is progressing well in the publishing sector. Differences between national copyright laws do not constitute an obstacle to the creation of an online market for the publishing sector. As mentioned previously, the publishing sector benefits from a healthy pan-European licensing system which is not stifled by the level of difference among the Member States legislation. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the one hand, it is highly unlikely that an EU Copyright law that takes precedence over national copyrights would be able to take into account the diverse cultural and legal traditions within the Member States. It seems particularly difficult in view of the fundamental differences between the system of "droit d'auteur" in continental Europe and the British-Irish Copyright model. But even within the tradition of "droit d'auteur" substantial differences exist. The question of moral rights or the different notions of "originality" that give rise to copyright protection as well as the well-established and much-litigated UK definition of 'Fair Dealing' for copyright exceptions are just a few examples of such differences. On the other hand, if such a Community title is construed in parallel to national titles, the risk is to add an unnecessary layer of legal complexity and burden in Europe. It is also relevant to note that an EU Copyright title would risk lowering copyright protection standards, which would certainly discourage investment in the digital content market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is not the first time that the Commission has asked about the pros and cons of an EU Copyright Code. It has considered the possibility of using the new Article 118 of the Lisbon Treaty as a legal basis for this future legal instrument. However, it is not clear whether the Treaty confers specific competency to the EU in this regard, especially for copyright, since its Article 118 was drafted for industrial property purposes. According to the UK House of Lords, "the new Article 118 of the TFEU is a restatement of existing powers. Although the Treaty of Lisbon would not confer additional IP powers on the EU, it marks a statement of political intent and a commitment to achieving the Community patent". It has not been fully confirmed as to whether Article 118 of the new Lisbon Treaty confers competency to the EC for the creation of a single "Community copyright title". Article 118 was foreseen for industrial property and therefore there is a risk of legal uncertainty including a possible annulment before the European Court of Justice for lack of legal basis. Copyright is acquired without registration. This is the core principle of Copyright as enshrined in the Berne Convention, and any parallels drawn between patent titles which need to be registered and Copyright is extremely perilous.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The introduction of a European copyright code or an optional unitary copyright title is therefore highly unlikely to produce the intended practical results and might in fact take at least a decade to achieve. European publishers would therefore prefer to have the Commission work on the enforcement of existing rules, the facilitation of pragmatic dialogues and the promotion of voluntary solutions such as the Memorandum of Understanding on Key Principles on the Digitisation and Making Available of Out-of-Commerce Works signed by all stakeholders concerned.
