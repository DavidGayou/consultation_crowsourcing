      Introduction
      The rejection of the ACTA treaty in July 2012 by the European Parliament
should have prompted the European Commission to revise Directive 2001/29/CE on
copyright in order to take into account the demands expressed by European citizens
who had mobilised in large numbers against the threat to their fundamental rights
posed by ACTA. This consultation therefore is rather late in coming.

       The Commission instead launched the “Licences for Europe” process which
contains the assumption that simple contractual solutions suffice to adapt the
regulatory copyright framework to the challenges of the digital environment. Having
been member of the working group “User Generated Content”, La Quadrature du Net
was able to observe that this contractual approach was completely unfit to address
the aspirations of citizens who hoped that their fundamental cultural rights would
finally be recognised. Despite what the consultation claims, “Licences for Europe”
was a complete failure. Unfortunately the lessons have not been learned yet.

       La Quadrature du Net deplores the fact that the European Commission has,
despite the rejection of ACTA, committed itself to the negotiations of new commercial
treaties that include sections on “intellectual property” and that appear to attempt the
introduction of measures similar to those in ACTA. A copy of the CETA treaty i
between Canada and the European Union, leaked a few days only after the rejection
of ACTA, proved that CETA contained ACTA's most dangerous sections relating to
criminal sanctions and repressive measures on copyright. The current TTIP/TAFTA
negotiations between the United States of America and the European Union raise the
same concernsii. Although the treaty's content is being kept secret, the Commission's
negotiating mandate includes questions on intellectual property and could therefore
herald the return of a Super-ACTAiii. Not only do these commercial negotiations
disrespect the democratic decision-making process generally, they also throw
significant discredit on this very consultation specifically as decisions on the matters
addressed here might already have been taken behind closed doors during the CETA
and TAFTA negotiations.

       Of course civil society groups did not wait around for the European
Commission to develop good ideas on copyright reform in Europe. They tabled
proposals that seek to balance the recognition of the cultural right of individuals with
the respect due to authors, and that suggest new ways to support cultural creation
financially.

      La Quadrature contributed to this process with its July 2012 publication
“Elements for the reform of copyright and related cultural policies” iv.




                                                                                      3
La Quadrature du Net's Programme for the
Positive Reform of Copyright
       The digital era holds immense cultural potential for everyone and a new world
in which creative and expressive activities lie at the heart of our society. Despite a
frequently hostile environment, this promise is being realised daily. In numerous
areas, digital culture is the experimental laboratory in which innovation thrives. New
dynamic social processes are invented that encourage the sharing of creative
products, foster the growth of digital and real-life communities and support their
creative works. The objective of an effective reform of copyright is to create a
supportive environment for these developments, or at the very least, not to hamper
them.

        Several schemes have tried to create artificial scarcity of copies in the digital
environment and to control and limit their use. This obsession fails to deal with the
real challenges posed by digital culture. The most important arising from a positive
development: an increasing number of persons are involved in innovation and
creation. From the amateur to the professional, their products are getting better and
more interesting. New skills are developed and individuals make time for these
activities and for the social interactions that allow them to develop professionally and
socially. However, our current social and regulatory system limits or even blocks the
access to these opportunities of a large number of individuals.

       La Quadrature du Net believes that the objective of copyright reform must be
to support the creativity of European citizens and not only to defend the interests of
established cultural industries. In order to be effective, the reform has to involve
social, economic and political measures that go beyond the immediate goal of
copyright reform. The legal framework is however essential to end the constant legal
challenges to innovation in the digital sphere.

       In order to support such a reform, La Quadrature du Net developed a 14-point
programme, organised into four sections, that considers the non-commercial
practices of individuals, non-commercial collective uses, the cultural economy and
the technical, legal and financial infrastructures.




                                                                                       4
       La Quadrature du Net deplores the overall orientation of the consultation. In
contrast to the aspirations of European citizens, the principal objective of the
Commission in this consultation is “whether further measures […] need to be taken
at EU level […] to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the
Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders”. The
Commission thus completely discards many important questions and passes over the
most crucial ones on the recognition of the cultural rights of individuals. The
principle underpinning DRM (Digital Rights Management, a technical system of
copyright protection) remains unquestioned for instance, even though these “digital

                                                                                   5
handcuffs” have, since their introduction as prevention against circumvention in the
2001 directive, significantly weakened the rights of individuals. Even more crucially,
the consultation utterly fails to address the most important question that any
effective debate on the adaptation of copyright to the digital age must address: the
legalisation of non-commercial sharing of digital works between individuals.

       For the reasons stated above our response does not always conform to the
order of questions in the questionnaire. We have moreover addressed more generally
questions whose formulations were too closed to allow an adequate and complete
reply.


I. The Recognition of non-commercial sharing between
individuals through the exhaustion of rights
       80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal
       framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such
       matters should be addressed.

       La Quadrature du Net greatly deplores the fact that the questionnaire fails to
address the question of online sharing between individuals even though this has, for
more than 30 years, represented the main challenge to existing copyright legislation
and remains unsolved. La Quadrature du Net believes that the legalisation of
non-commercial online sharing between individuals must be the first adjustment of
European copyright rules. All other propositions submitted by La Quadrature du Net
are linked directly or indirectly to this measure.

        For the last 15 years, the war against non-commercial online sharing between
individuals was waged obsessively. By all means technological, legal, police and
political, attempts were made to stop what is not only inevitable but also legitimate
and usefulv. While peer-for-peer file-sharing was stigmatised and penalised, it created
amongst its supporters large online communities. Although responsible for only a
very small part of the difficulties encountered by the established cultural industries in
their effort to adapt to the digital age, it was, without evidence, labelled “theft” vi.
During the last ten years, researchers, civil society and creative communities have
sought to obtain a legal recognition for non-commercial sharing. Many approaches
were proposed (exceptions to copyright, mandatory collective management, extended
collective licences, etc.). But as is true of most innovative political thought, these
proposals found themselves confronted with many difficulties, especially when
established interests erected obstacles in their way. In order to succeed, the
recognition of non-commercial sharing of digital work between individuals must base
itself on a clear and simple solution. What better way therefore than to adapt the
familiar mechanisms of non-commercial sharing of tangible works to the digital
world?

       Exhaustion of rights, known as the “first-sale doctrine” in the USA, is the legal
doctrine by which certain exclusive rights are not transferred when a tangible
copyrighted work is purchased. It means that you are able to lend, give, and even sell
or rent out the work in some cases. Exhaustion of rights is neither an exception nor a
limitation to copyright even if it has been codified vii and interpreted as an exception

                                                                                       6
or limitation in the past. In fact, exhaustion of rights applies in situations in which
certain exclusive rights no longer exist. The question whether to impose an exception
or limitation therefore makes no sense. What happens when, as is the case in the
digital realm, the original work and its copy are indistinguishable from each other?
Two approaches are possible but conflict with each other. Those who have a
doctrinal approach to exclusive rights have tried to prohibit all applications of
exhaustion of rights to intangible goods. The European regulatory framework did
this by restricting the applicability of exhaustion of rights in the digital domain in
article 3.3 of directive 2001/29/CE which specifies that: “The rights referred to in
paragraphs 1 and 2 [exclusive rights of authors, performers and producers of
phonographs, videograms and cinematographic or radiophonic works] shall not be
exhausted by any act of communication to the public or making available to the
public as set out in this Article.” One should note that this was in no way a
requirement of the 1996 WIPO treaties that the directive sought to implement. To
cancel the application of exhaustion of rights destroyed elementary cultural rights of
individuals to goods and works they acquired. In contrast, the European Court of
Justice decided in 2012viii that exhaustion of rights applied to downloaded software,
although it restricted this right to the specific file that could be transmitted under a
number of constraints but not copied.

       The alternative approach extends exhaustion of rights as applied to tangible
copies of copyrighted works for lending, exchanging, circulating, sharing, to the case
of digital copies. The potential for these activities depends entirely on the possession
of a digital copy and ability to copy it to make it available to others. The interpretation
of exhaustion of rights as applied to digital copies would therefore be both broader
and more restrictive. Broader because it would include the right to reproduction;
more restrictive because it only applies to non-commercial activities of individuals.
This would enable a better synergy with the wider cultural economy.

      La Quadrature du Net proposes the following concerning non-commercial
sharing between individualsix:

   •   Define “between individuals” to cover all transmissions of a file (by exchanging
       storage devices, uploading files onto a blog or peer-to-peer network, sending it
       via email…) between a storage space “owned by an individual” to a storage
       space “owned by another individual”. “Owned by an individual” is self-evident
       in the case of a personal computer, a personal hard drive or cell phone. But
       this definition should also include storage space on a server when the control
       of this space is solely in the hands of the user (user space rented from an
       Internet Access Provider, cloud hosting service in the case where the access
       provider has no control over the content).
   •   Sharing is non-commercial when no profit results, directly or indirectly (for
       example via advertising revenue) for either of the two individuals who are
       party to the sharing. The notion of profit must be understood in its strict
       monetary sense or as a swap against another good. Being able to access a file
       that represents a work that is elsewhere a commercial work should not be
       understood as a form of revenue or profit.
      Finally, if non-commercial sharing between individuals was legalised, services
that facilitate it, for example the operation of a DC++ Hub, eMule server or
BitTorrent tracker, would have to be legal, under the condition that there is no

                                                                                         7
centralisation of digital content, nor advertisement associated to downloading or
viewing/listening/reading. We propose moreover that service providers should be
blocked from interfering with the conditions of exchange itself, in order to prevent
them from making a profit by providing preferential treatment to one individual or
copyrighted workx which would break the requirement that the transaction be
non-commercial and “between individuals”. This limitation aims moreover to
maximise the benefit in terms of equality, cultural diversity and to ensure the best
collaboration between non-commercial online sharing and the commercial cultural
economy.

       By this application of exhaustion of rights to the digital environment the
following important results are achieved:
    • Recognition that non-commercial sharing between individuals of digital works
       do not constitute copyright infringements.
   •   Facilitation of the establishment and recognition of new means of funding for
       authors (see p. 23).

       Some reformers who share our objectives suggest nevertheless a different
approach. They propose a copyright exception or the establishment of a mandatory
collective management of copyright for non-commercial sharing. There are several
obstacles to these. Although they are not prohibited by the Three-Step Test
prescribed by the Berne convention and TRIPS accords xi, they require a more
significant revision of the acquis communautaire than our proposal does. The main
drawback however would be the continuation of noxious aspects of current copyright
regulation to new regulation (heirs and other persons who are not the authors
receiving the majority of copyright rent, unfair division of benefits).

       La Quadrature du Net is open to all solutions that allow the real legalisation of
non-commercial sharing of digital works between individuals and the recognition of
this as a cultural right. But it holds that an approach based on the exhaustion of
rights has important advantages over a new exception to copyright, which would
trigger the need for compensation payments, and over a mechanism for mandatory
collective management. Most importantly, sharing would continue to be considered,
not a cultural right, but instead a wrong done against copyright holders, even though
such harm to copyright holders by online sharing has never been demonstrated.




                                                                                      8
II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
      A. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of
      what needs to be authorised (or not) in digital
      transmissions?

      The notion of “making available”

      The notion of “making available” represents one of the most harmful aspects of
the 2001 directive. It extends the previous scope of copyright (reproduction/
communication/ performance of works) in a legally ambiguous manner.

       While the stated aim of this notion was to provide a clear definition of actions
such as file-sharing on a network (upload in peer-to-peer or “seeding”), the vagueness
of its meaning and the fact that it was not defined by the directive, allowed
rightholders to claim that copyright rules applied in situations that were previously
excluded.

       Any revision of the 2001/29/EC directive must remove the notion of “making
available” in order to return to the previous meaning of reproduction and public
communication. Our main partner and competitor, the US, has avoided
implementing the “making available” right in practice. This clearly gives it a
significant competitive advantage in terms of innovation. As La Quadrature du Net
advocates for the legalisations of non-commercial sharing between individuals on the
basis of exhaustion of rights, it also demands that certain actions of “making
available” not be included in any exclusive rights of the rightholder.


      Linking and browsing

      11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a
         work or other subject matter protected under
         copyright, either in general or under specific
         circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
         rightholder?

       La Quadrature du Net advocates strongly for the full recognition of the
legitimacy of referencing. One of the Internet's distinguishing features is that any
published online content can quickly be accessed via a hyperlink or URL. Hyperlink
referencing is nothing less than the contemporary incarnation of the established
tradition of referencing of existing publications. Clearly, the freedom to reference any
content is a precondition for the freedom of expression and communication.
Numerous legal decisions have confirmed the link between the publication of content
and the freedom for others to reference it directly via hypertext.




                                                                                      9
       In the name of copyright, this essential freedom and fundamental aspect of the
Internet is now being attacked. This happened in a recent case opposing Google to the
German press. A new neighbouring right had been introduced that threw doubts on
the legality of linking to online news websites xii. In several other countries (Ireland,
France, Belgium and Italy) the temptation to regulate hyperlinks pointing to news
sources was also strong. In the United Kingdom, the Meltwater affair, which involved
clipping services, might result in a situation in which hyperlinks to news articles
become payingxiii. Recently, the Court of Justice of the European Unionxiv confirmed
that when content is made accessible to users without access restriction, one is not
required to obtain permission to link to this content.

        This decision did not specify whether the person who provides the link would
have to check that the primary source had permission to make the content available
to the public. Requiring this would entail high legal uncertainty for providers of links
and damage a key principle of the Internet.

        Whatever answer is given to this question in a context of unauthorised sharing,
if the non-commercial sharing between individuals is legalised, the act of linking to a
work, even if copyrighted, will be a right and not a crime.


       12.Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the
          temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter
          protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
          memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under
          specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
          rightholder?

       The Internet works by storing copies of a visited website temporarily in the
cache memory of a user's computer. These local copies are currently exempt by the
2001 directive from copyright. This exception is the only one that EU member states
are obliged to transpose into their national legal systems.

       To question this exception would undermine the very functioning of the
Internet and represent a completely disproportional and unworkable application of
copyright and furthermore, call into question “the right to read”. Nevertheless,
certain rightholders now argue that the simple visit to a website should be subjected
to exclusive copyright and that it could, if need be, be paying. This question was
posed in the U.K. by the Newspaper Licensing Agency in the context of a legal
process in the High Court and which is now in front of the High Court of the
European Unionxv.

       Any revision of the 2001 directive must clarify the exception for temporary
copies in order to ensure that it covers visits to websites.


Download to own digital content

      The questions in this section only refer to the second-hand sale of digital
goods. But this is a narrow framing of the question of “ownership”. The ownership

                                                                                      10
that consumers expect when buying a file of a work cannot be restricted to that of the
one specific copy obtained without leading to highly absurd and harmful results.
Instead, the Commission should examine the extent to which exhaustion of rights
applies to the digital environment and admit that acquiring a copy bestows rights well
beyond that of reselling the product in the second-hand market.

       Several businesses have started proposing ways in which the owner of a digital
file could resell it by “guaranteeing” that their copy is deleted from their computer
during the transaction (ReDIGI for music in the USA, Valve for video games, etc.).
The reselling of a tangible good is legally possible on the basis of first sale doctrine in
the USA and exhaustion of rights in Europe. The mechanisms that regulate copyright
in the tangible realm are essential for cultural practices as they allow the donation
and exchange of goods, such as books, CDs or DVDs. But to attempt to carbon copy
this to the digital world by demanding the suppression of files, demonstrates a
profound misunderstanding of the non-rival character of digital works

       Rightholders have reacted to the existence of these new services of resale of
intangible goods by taking them to court, which have, for now, ruled in their favour xvi,
except in the case of software licences for which the Court of Justice of the European
Union ruled that exhaustion of rights appliesxvii. But in truth, framing the resale of
digital files as a problem is misguided. A person who owns a file should always be
able to copy and share it online as long as they do not benefit financially. If
non-commercial sharing between individuals were recognised as a right, rightholders
would have nothing to worry about from the services of resale as sharing would take
care of this form of distribution.

      If instead the second-hand resale of files were allowed, it would lead to several
harmful developments. Any system of resale would use DRM systems which ignore
the basic rights of individuals to the cultural content they own. Moreover, music
industry giants, such as Amazon or Apple, are already positioning themselves for this
market opportunity in such a way that would reinforce, using patents and other
means, their vertical integration and lock users into their systems.

       This would clearly threaten citizens' fundamental cultural rights. The only
solution that can really get rid of this sham is the legalisation of non-commercial
sharing between individuals. Second-hand resale or digital lending are simply ways to
deny the existence of the logic of non-commercial exchange of cultural goods on the
Internet.

       In order to acknowledge the legitimacy of sharing practices and draw out the
best aspects the digital revolution has to offer, La Quadrature du Net draws the
logical consequence of the abundance of perfect copies in the digital world: extend
the mechanism of exhaustion of rights to non-commercial transactions between
individuals. The alternative is an unacceptable level of repression. Moreover, the
legalisation of online sharing, as we propose it, ensures a synergy between
commercial and non-commercial digital activities.




                                                                                        11
       B. Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a
       good idea?

       Legal experts in all countries have searched for ways of how to avoid the
following perverse and significant phenomena:
   •   Copyright rent going to rightholders who have no incentive to stimulate
       innovation, for example heirs or stock owners of copyright portfolios;
   •   The increasing number of orphan and out-of-commerce works;
   •   The weakness of the public domain.

       This search has resulted in a proposal that makes the economic benefit of
copyright (but not the moral rights such as attribution or disclosure) dependent on
the voluntary registration of works by their authors. This registration would be for a
limited duration (a few years) with the possibility of extension. This proposal is faced
with certain difficulties. It might not be compatible with the Berne convention and
would have an impact on those authors that are less predisposed to embrace
bureaucracy. The threat however, of economic exploitation and possible
re-appropriations of their works by commercial actors, would represent a strong
motivator.

       Marco Ricolfi has proposed copyright 2.0 according to which works would be
placed by default under a regime similar to that of the Creative Commons licence,
excluding the case in which the author decides to opt for the older copyright model.
In order to prevent the undesired commercial exploitation with possible
re-appropriation, the default licence could be of the type By-NC or by-NC-SA, which
would allow modifications but require authorisation for commercial uses. As
suggested by Marco Ricolfi himself, these two approaches, the registration for limited
duration and copyright 2.0, can be combined. However, the adoption of copyright 2.0
would not dispense with the need to legalise non-commercial sharing between
individuals, as it would not be dependent on the good-will of any person but would
result from the simple act of having published a digital work. However, copyright 2.0
would also deal with the question of the right to remix (the right to quote, make a
parody of, etc. which would, when appropriate, base itself on the classic
interpretation of copyright) (see infra p.18).




                                                                                     12
         C. Term of protection – is it appropriate?

         20 Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate
         in the digital environment?

       Members of La Quadrature du Net not only signed but also actively
participated in the Communia network's drafting of the Public Domain Manifesto xviii.

       This manifesto states that “The term of copyright protection should be
reduced. The excessive length of copyright protection combined with an absence of
formalities is highly detrimental to the accessibility of our shared knowledge and
culture. Moreover, it increases the occurrence of orphan works, works that are
neither under the control of their authors nor part of the Public Domain, and in
either case cannot be used. Thus, for new works the duration of copyright
protection should be reduced to a more reasonable term”.

       It also affirms that “Copyright protection should last only as long as
necessary to achieve a reasonable compromise between protecting and rewarding
the author for his intellectual labour and safeguarding the public interest in the
dissemination of culture and knowledge. From neither the perspective of the author
nor the general public do any valid arguments exist (whether historical, economic,
social or otherwise) in support of an exceedingly long term of copyright protection.
While the author should be able to reap the fruits of his intellectual labour, the
general public should not be deprived for an overly long period of time of the
benefits of freely using those works”.

        The term of copyright protection in the EU is excessively long. The extension
to 70 years after the death of the author means that the use of a great number of
works is impaired without economic justification. Moreover, the extension will profit
only a minority of authors. A reduction in the term of protection fixed by the Berne
Conventionxix must be obtained with WIPO. It is very regrettable that the European
Union should have extended neighbouring rights of actors and musical recordings
from 50 to 70 years whilst the Communia network had expressed its disagreement
with this extension. Here again, only a very small proportion of artists will actually
profit, while the disadvantages for society as a whole will be very strong (notably in
terms of the multiplication of orphan works). It would therefore be ill-advised to
reproduce this mistake with neighbouring rights of audiovisual works.

       We recommend a reduction of term of copyright protection to a maximum of
30 years after first publication. This reduction could be introduced progressively (the
reduction of one year for each year gone by) in such a way as to avoid the
expropriation of exclusive rights. Let us remember that the 14 years protection
contained in the Queen Anne Act of 1709 was justified by the fact that this length was
deemed sufficient to ensure that a book will have reached its public during that time.
What is one meant to think of a duration for the digital age that is often eight times as
long1?

 70 years after the death of the last author often means more than 112 years after publication.

                                                                                                  13
       Beyond the question of excessively long terms, La Quadrature du Net holds the
opinion that the public domain must be given an explicit legal status in the European
Union through the introduction of a positive status in the European copyright
directive. Confronted with the continued expansion of intellectual property rights
over the last 30 years, researchers and legal experts have launched a project that aims
to recognise the positive status of the public domain, voluntary commons and the
fundamental rights of users (including those of authors) with regard to works xx.

       At present, the public domain is, at best, considered a residue or a market
failure, and the commons a space in which there has, as yet, been a failure to
privatise, and the rights of users tolerated only because no means have been found to
eradicate them. As soon as these communal entities have been attributed a positive
status, the impact of any new legal or political measure on their well-being,
enrichment, upkeep and accessibility will have to be studied and taken into account.

       Communia's Public Domain Manifesto contains numerous principles that
represent a strong basis for the positive recognition of the public domain. A first step
in the right direction already exists in Chilean law xxi. Moreover, the Lescure report,
which was submitted to the French president and the culture minister in May 2013,
proposed the introduction of such a positive definition in French law in order to
“reinforce the protection in the digital environment”, “indicate that faithful
reproductions of works in the public domain belong also to the public domain, and
affirm the supremacy of the public domain on these interrelated rights”xxii.

       Similarly, it is very harmful that EU member states were left with the ability to
invent new exclusive neighbouring rights (neighbouring rights on content indexation
of press created in 2013 in Germany, new neighbouring rights profiting the
life-performance producers that is currently under consideration in France, etc.). Not
only does this harm the harmonisation of rights across the EU, it also threatens the
public domain.



III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the
Member States?

       The biggest limitation to the harmonisation of copyright legislation in the EU
has been the failure to make obligatory the transposition into national law of
exceptions listed in Directive 2001/29/UE. One consequence has been that European
citizens were not able to fully and efficiently exploit available culture and knowledge.
In order to solve this problem, it is essential to make obligatory the transpositions of
those exceptions that are essential for fundamental freedom and the healthy
development of cultural practices: Exceptions for educational and research purposes,
for libraries, archives and organisations of a similar calling (including organisations
offering public access to orphan works and their reuse), exceptions for collective
non-commercial use, exceptions for citations in all media, for the use of parody, etc.
However, the harmonisation of exceptions should not prevent member states from

                                                                                     14
trying out new exceptions. This right was recognised in the Berne Convention and
TRIPS agreement, subject only to the Three-Step Test. Experimenting with policies
that favour the common interest must be a driving force in the development of new
rights in the changing environment of the digital world.


       25. What would be the best approach to provide for flexibility?
       (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic
       revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission,
       built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing
       provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what
       would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an
       approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
       Internal Market.

       Although La Quadrature du Net does not advocate for the introduction of fair
use in Europe, we believe that the status of exceptions to copyright in the EU must be
strengthened and that it is currently weakened by the abusive interpretation of the
Three-Step Test.

       The maximalist interpretation used by some courts of justice has eroded the
strength of exceptions. This was the case for the exception for private copying in
France in 2006 in the Mullholland Drive decision by the Cour de Cassation xxiii. In
order to remedy this problem, La Quadrature du Net proposes the introduction of a
more reasonable interpretation of the Three-Step Test, as many European legal
scholars already advocatexxiv. Furthermore, any revision of the directive must clearly
state that the Three-Step Test describes general measures to be used by European
legislators and does not outline principles that can be called on by courts, tribunals or
rightholders.


       A. Access to content in libraries and archives

       La Quadrature du Net believes that libraries and archives play a crucial role in
the circulation and diffusion of knowledge and that they should profit from, rather
than be restricted by, the digital environment. As stated above, this exception must be
transposed into all member states' national laws to create a secure environment
across Europe in which these cultural institutions can provide access to copyrighted
works. To this end, La Quadrature du Net proposes two modifications to European
copyright rules:
   •   Make orphan works freely available for a wide range of uses in libraries,
       archives and other public institutions.
   •   Establish the freedom of collective non-commercial use.

       La Quadrature du Net thoroughly regrets that the EU declared itself in January
2014xxv against the adoption of a treaty within the WIPO framework dedicated to
exceptions for libraries and archives, and preferred instead simple licences which is
not an adequate solution.


                                                                                      15
   1) Make orphan works freely available for a wide range of uses in
      libraries, archives and other public institutions.

       For a good many years a workable solution to the problem of the great number
of orphan works (those works whose authors or rightholders are not known or cannot
be contacted) has been known: Libraries and archives, but also any actor who chooses
this as their mission, must be allowed to make orphan works freely available to the
public. This would facilitate the access to and use of these works, at least for
non-commercial purposes, but also open up the possibility for commercial
exploitation through republications. This system would not involve any payment by
users but could be linked to a deposit (guaranteed by the state or para-fiscal schemes)
that would protect users from the risk that a rightholder comes forward at a later date
(in general the publishers or heirs of the original rightholder). Users can in no way be
held responsible for damages for any use prior to the time that a rightholder came
forward. The Scandinavian countries have set up a system which resembles this idea
and which is compatible with current European lawxxvi.

        The European directive Orphan Works 2012/28/UE which allows certain uses
of orphan worksxxvii is an imperfect system but it attempts to make it possible for
libraries and archives to provide access to orphan works. There are several problems
with the text. Firstly, it imposes on any user a “diligent search” for rightholders and
thus introduces an important legal uncertainty and risk to institutions such as
libraries (who are by nature risk-averse), who will therefore abstain from making use
of this right. It also introduces a system of copyright compensation for the time when
previously unknown rightholders come forward that could lead to a situation in
which rightholders choose to wait for their work to be digitised, published and gain a
significant audience before coming forward and demanding compensation. It
moreover contains a list of approved uses, and thus excludes uses that are not
covered by copyright, such as indexation and cataloguing. The final point is that the
the types of institutions that can make use of orphan works, or give access to them, is
restricted.

       Despite these faults, the text is definitely preferable to the 2012 French law on
out-of-commerce 20th century booksxxviii, which for the sake of commercial
exploitation disenfranchises authors, leaving them only with the choice of opting out,
and deprives the public of access to these works. The situation of orphan works is not
comparable to that of out-of-commerce works and must not be treated with the same
instruments. Any solution to the problem of out-of-commerce books must return all
rights to the author. Digital and paper editions should be treated separately. There
should be a separate contract for digital publishing. And it should ensure that rights
are returned to the author when the tangible or intangible edition of the work is no
longer available.

        La Quadrature du Net warns the Commission against extending any system
that resembles the above-mentioned French law to the whole of the EU although the
French government appears to be advocating for this. Alternatives more respectful of
authors and the public can be found in Norway for instance, which offers the free
access to the totality of its literature published before 2001 xxix. Finally, it is very
regrettable that the directive affirms that it is “without prejudice” with regard to
measures in members states on out-of-commerce works as this gives the impression
that it sanctions actions that treat orphan works like out-of-commerce works, such as

                                                                                     16
the French lawxxx which undermines the rights of authors and the public for the
benefit of certain publishers.


   2) Establish the freedom of collective non-commercial use

       Aside non-commercial use by individuals, collective non-commercial use plays
an essential part in the access to knowledge and culture, most notably in the context
of activities organised by libraries, museums and archives. These activities can
involve the display of copyrighted works in spaces freely accessible to the public, the
online use of copyrighted materials by not-for-profit organisations, the ability to offer
users, on a non-commercial basis, the means of reproduction of these works, and
access to digital resources in libraries and archives.

       Right now these collective uses occur in a very limited and ill-adapted legal
setting. The unfounded presumption that collective use of digital content hurts sales
causes the significant risk that rightholders might attempt to prevent libraries from
offering digital content to their users. In a context in which non-commercial
exchanges were legalised, collective uses will also have to be protected and extended.

       The following measures should be put in place:
   •   Transform the exception for personal use, which includes use within the family
       sphere, into an exception for non-commercial display of copyrighted works in
       public spaces.
   •   Non-profit organisations should have the same opportunities available as
       individuals in terms of online non-commercial use of copyrighted works.
   •   The means of reproduction, including digital reproduction, offered by
       institutions to the public should be included in the exclusion for private
       copying, including occurrences via remote access and transfer.

       Finally the specific role that libraries should play in making copyrighted works,
including in digital form, available to the public is an important question. A whole
spectrum of solutions can be imagined: From a situation in which libraries are the
source of a publically-accessible digital reference-copy, to a situation where libraries
would be authorised to communicate DRM-free files through a collective licensing or
a per copy exception.

       B. Teaching, research and disabilities

       Educational practices and research have been transformed by the digital
world. Considering teaching practices for example, three main changes have taken
place: education easily reaches outside teaching establishments, the notion of
“educational resources” is outdated as every work and information has become a
potential educational resource, and finally, the pupil or student in not only user but
also author and content creator. The present exceptions that apply to education are so
outmoded that the European Commission has already stated in its Green Paper
Copyright in the Knowledge Economyxxxi, that exception for education must be
enlargedxxxii.


                                                                                      17
       All societies worthy of that name have extended rights for education and
research according to the following principles:

   •   Exceptions must cover all educational and research practices and it must be
       independent from the framework in which these practices occur. The
       exception for education should for instance not be limited to schools or depend
       on the fact that the persons involved have the status of pupils or students.
       Education in all its forms, formal or informal, institutionalised, or communal,
       should be included, as should workshops of a cultural and artistic nature and
       educational programmes in museums and libraries. Educational practices
       should be distinguished from other forms of use by the nature of the activities
       and in the nature of the role played by teachers, facilitators and tutors on one
       hand and participants on the other. Research practices should continue to be
       defined by the nature of the activities and their goal, as is the case for R&D tax
       credits in many countries.
   •   Exceptions must apply to all copyrighted works. Nobody can decide
       beforehand whether a particular work or content has an educational value. The
       exclusion of published tutorials or manuals in France is an example that must
       not be followed.
   •   No payment by users must be involved. As every author knows, there's no
       better way to get recognition of your work and secure long-term income than
       that their work becomes an educational resource.
   •   Pupils, students or participants in an educational setting should be treated as
       normal authors. The notion of “user-generated content” is an invention by
       intermediaries who want to profit from the freedom of being able to use,
       without paying or consideration for the rights of authors.

       Other kinds of exceptions, such as the one concerning the blind and
visually-impaired, at present prescribed by the Marrakesh Treaty signed in June
2013xxxiii in the context of WIPO, must also be included. These exceptions should
moreover not only be obligatory, but also defined in a sufficiently effective and broad
manner that guarantee access for intended uses (reading and writing in this case). In
light of the importance of educational and research activities and of access to culture
for disabled persons, it matters that the adjustments lead to a system that is
free-of-charge. Concerning education and research, Canada voted in October 2011 a
broad exception to copyright which is, for the most part, free-of-charge, and which
could be an inspiration for developments in Europexxxiv.




                                                                                      18
       C. Text and data mining

          55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what
          would be its main elements? Which activities should be covered
          and under what conditions?

       Text and data mining represent major opportunities for research in the natural
but also in the human sciences, in particular human digital sciences, a field that is
growing rapidly. A special working group was set up in the framework of “Licences
for Europe” but which reached no consensus. Representatives of libraries and
researchers found that contractual solutions would be ineffective as research practice
can only develop autonomously in a secure legal setting.

      Text and data mining is the automated version of the older research practice of
indexation, referencing, counting the number of occurrences, etc. There is no cause to
argue that what was free-of-charge in the analogue environment should fall under
copyright legislation in the digital realm, other than to drastically restrict innovation
and the development of research in Europe.

       La Quadrature du Net subscribes completely to the view formulated by The
International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) for whom
text and data mining should be covered by “the right to read”, at least for purposes of
research, and that “the right to mine” should be implied without the need for
supplementary contractual clauses. For this purpose one could envisage 1. to consider
that these activities result from exhaustion of rights and that they are completely
free-of-charge, 2. to introduce a new exception in European regulation that applies to
data mining for research purposes, including when it is necessary, for these ends, to
make temporary copies of the analysed body of work. This exception should cover
both copyright and database law.

       Failing that, the European Union will fall behind the USA where recent
decisions have given a solid legal basis for text and data mining based on fair use
(consider notably the decision with regard to Google Books by Judge Chin who
considered that text and data mining constitutes a transformative usage of work
conform to the criteria for fair usexxxv).




                                                                                      19
      D. User-generated content

62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be
its main elements? Which activities should be covered and under what
conditions?

       La Quadrature du Net was a member of the working group (WG2) of the
“Licences for Europe” process dedicated to the question of user-generated content xxxvi.
With the agreement of other representatives of user groups and civil society, La
Quadrature de Net denounced the disguised presence of lobbyists in the working
group, their covert presence shedding more discredit on the “Licences for Europe”
process. However, even without this, the working groups' orientation was not useful
because it postulated that contractual solutions were sufficient to deal with questions
that arise due to transformative practices such as remix and mashupxxxvii.

       La Quadrature du Net considers that these creative practices represent one of
the most interesting and important aspects of digital culture and copyright law
should adapt to provide a secure legal setting for their creative development.
Contractual measures cannot offer satisfactory solutions and currently represent a
real threat to freedom of expression and creation online. Google's ContentID system
on YouTube for example frequently takes down mashup or remix videos even though,
as parodies, they would be frequently excluded from copyright in several legal
systems in Europe. For example, La Quadrature du Net's video “Robocopyright
ACTA” on Youtube was taken down for copyright infringement although it was
undeniably a parody. Contractual systems tend to turn into a kind of “private
copyright police” which act in a domain in which only judges are qualified to rule, i.e.
on the censuring of an online content for copyright reasonsxxxviii.

        La Quadrature du Net deplores therefore that the Commission continues to
privilege contractual solutions. We regret also that it uses the erroneous term
“user-generated content” to speak of remix, mashup and other such practices. These
transformative works constitute original work even as they borrow material from
previous works. To speak of user-generated content introduces a false hierarchy and a
value judgement that separates the amateur “user” from the “professional” author,
whereas this distinction does not exist in copyright law and is meaningless in the
digital environment.

       For these reasons, La Quadrature du Net believes that a change in European
regulation with regard to transformative uses is necessary. This is the approach taken
by Canada which is the first country in the world to have introduced, in 2011, the
exception for non-commercial remixxxxix. Following the recommendations of the 2013
Lescure report such an exception is also being considered in France. Studying its
feasibility was entrusted to a task group led by the legal scholar Valérie-Laure
Benabouxl. An exception is also being studied in Ireland following the publication of
the “Modernising Copyright” reportxli.

        Any revision of the 2001 directive must study several possible solutions in
order to build a stronger legal basis for transformative work. The planned exception
for citations is broad enough to cover a large part of remix and mashup (the exception

                                                                                     20
applies to all kinds of media and does not apply to “short” citations but “proportional
to the aim”) but only under the condition that member states transpose it into
national law without restrictions (France for instance transposed the 2001/29
exception for citations in an extremely restrictive manner, in contrast to Germany).
The exception that applies to parodies should be extended to cover also
transformations for other purposes than parody. An exception, such as the one in
Canada, could also be introduced. Such an exception should not involve payment by
the user, as transformative practices are strongly linked to freedom of expression and
the right to cultural participation.

      La Quadrature du Net believes that the most coherent solution must consist of
the combination of these two measures:

       •   In a non-commercial context, the transformative practices of mashup or remix
           are a direct result of the legalisation on the basis of exhaustion of rights of
           non-commercial sharing between individuals. Within such a delineation,
           transformations should be freely available and free-of-charge, although under
           the requirement to attribute appropriately.
       •   Transformations that satisfy the requirement for originality should receive
           copyright protection and should be authorised even for commercial purposes.



           E. Private copying and reprography

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
application of the private copying and reprography exceptions2 in the
digital environment?

        To a large extent, the private copying and reprography exceptions have not
fulfilled their regulatory role in the digital environment. Courts in several member
states, when confronted with the first cases relating to the downloading of
copyrighted material, considered these acts as covered by the private copying
exception. This happened in France during the first decade of the century xlii and in
Spain, where downloading copyrighted work through peer-to-peer networks was
ruled to be covered by the exception for private copying xliii. In 2012, Dutch
parliamentarians refused to criminalise the downloading of copyrighted work,
believing that it could be considered as within the private copying exception under
the condition that it was matched by a “private copying tax”xliv . In France, lawmakers
had considered in 2005, during the transposition of the 2001 directive into national
law, to legalise online sharing on the basis of the exception of private copying, linked
with a mechanism for financial compensation in the form of a monthly charge to
Internet subscriptions (global licence systemxlv).

       One can therefore work towards the legalisation of downloading of copyrighted
work through the exception of private copying. However, such a solution would be
unsatisfactory because, although it would legalise downloading, it would not legalise
the uploading of peer-to-peer sharing. For this reason La Quadrature du Net

2
    Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                                                                                       21
recommends instead that the online non-commercial sharing between individuals be
legalised (download, upload and other means of making it available).

         Another failing of using the private copying exception is the fact that sharing is
still considered to harm cultural industries although no study has demonstrated
thisxlvi. A question, related to this unfounded assumption, recently reached the Court
of Justice of the European Unionxlvii and seeks to know if a private copy had to be
made from a “lawful source”. The addition of this criteria has become the rule in
France since the modification of the regime of private copying in December 2011 was
introduced under the pressure of interest groups. These had advocated for it in order
to prevent the legalisation of downloading on the basis of private copying. La
Quadrature du Net opposed this development in so far as it caused a significant legal
ambiguity for users as they would be required to check on whether the source copy is
lawful (for instance was originally bought or licensed) although this would be very
difficult to do over the Internetxlviii.

       Any revision of the 2001 directive should clarify private copying in order to
prevent the “licensed source” criteria, even as the legalisation of online sharing would
be on a more effective legal basis using exhaustion of rights.


     66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to
     online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing,
     for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the
     development and functioning of new business models on the one
     hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

       As mentioned above, La Quadrature du Net advocates for the legalisation of
non-commercial sharing on the basis of exhaustion of rights. As stated previously, the
sharing between individuals should be defined as any transfer of a file from one
storage space “owned by an individual” to another storage space “owned by another
individual”. “Owned by an individual” is self-evident in the case of a personal
computer, a personal hard drive or cell phone but also includes storage space on a
server when the control of this space is exclusive to the user. Therefore, it would be
incoherent to introduce levies for online services such as storage space.

        Revenue collected through licence-fees has decreased significantly due to the
decline in the number of privately-owned tangible copies of work, especially when
this number is compared to the number of intangible copies in circulation. Because of
this, some propose to introduce new taxes on, for instance, connected devices or
“screens” (such as smartphones and tablets). This was proposed by the Lescure report
in Francexlix. La Quadrature du Net believes that this type of tax on the user is
illegitimate because it is not matched by new rights for the user. Also, they cannot be
justified by lost revenue as it was never demonstrated that online sharing harmed
rightholders. La Quadrature du Net recommends the system of contributory resource
pooling to ensure financial sustainability that is clearly distanced from this
unsubstantiated argument that sharing causes harm to rightholders (See next
section).



                                                                                        22
IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers
72. What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to
ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation
of your works and performances?

       The explosive increase in the number of creators and products, of all levels of
competence and quality, and the diversification of media forms has greatly
diminished the amount of time a work receives public attention and hence leads to a
unfamiliar but significant challenge for the economic sustainability of creative
practices. Although population growth and increased amounts of leisure time
mitigates these effects somewhat, overall, the average audience size and time
accorded to a work will continue to diminish until a new balance is found between the
production and reception of a work l. The current system of financial compensation is
therefore not sustainable over the long-term and will have to adapt to the new
environment. At the same time, creative and expressive activities are more and more
valued in society and the proportion of active participants is growing. The willingness
of a large segment of the population to contribute to their economic sustainability is
certainli. However, to translate this desire into a functioning system requires revenues
by distributors, financial investors or institutional players, who contribute nothing to
the creation itself, to be limited.

       On what mechanisms could we rely in order to ensure the economic
sustainability of digital culture in this context? The table below summarises the
benefits and weaknesses of different possible systems, including their ability to
extend to a greater number of creators and works, and their ability to promote
authors and works.

 resource pooling

       Some public professions, such as teaching and research, support a diverse and
dynamic cultural space, including a digital cultural space and we should be greatly
concerned by the threat to their existence and freedom. Thinking beyond this
however, three mechanisms have the potential to significantly contribute to the
sustainability of a many-to-all cultural society. Each mechanism implements a form
of resource pooling on a different scale. These three are: voluntary cooperative
resource pooling, statutory contribution organised by law but managed by
contributors, and basic income allowance. These mechanisms should not be conflated
with parafiscal systems with curatorial management which have multiplied in
number in recent years and whose governance is the target of serious criticism.

       Voluntary cooperative resource pooling (artist and author cooperatives,
production and publishing cooperatives, crowd-funding intermediaries such as
Kickstarter, Ulule, KissKissBankBank or Goteo etc.) has been developing
impressively. It already plays a crucial role pooling efforts and funds of creative
communities for projects that would not be possible without them (for instance
documentaries, investigative reports, useful software without a business models to
make it financially viable to develop and distribute, etc.). Author and artist
cooperatives and related editorial and publishing cooperatives are the natural
development model of creative digital communities and it is essential to provide a
more favourable tax and regulatory framework. An important question however is up
to what amounts participative financing can provide funding. Only the largest
platforms are in a position to attract a sufficient number of sponsors. Moreover, only
very limited space is offered for the presentation of projects and, as the great majority
of projects will not be promoted on the front page or by mailings, most will have to
rely on their own support networks.

       Statutory financial contribution resource-pooling imposed by law and
managed by contributors is fundamentally different from public subsidies based on
taxes or levies, such as the “TV licence” in the UK or the “avances sur recettes” in
Francelii as funds collected through this type of “crowd-sourcing on a societal level”
are allocated by contributors. In the Creative Contribution scheme advocated by La
Quadrature du Net and several cultural and society actors, funds are used to:


                                                                                      24
   •   support projects, for instance by financing their production and realisation,
       and supporting organisations such as cooperatives and culture and media
       education groups;
   •   remunerate contributors whose work has been shared on a non-commercial
       basis.

        Sums are allocated according to contributors' preferences in the first case, and
in the second case, on the basis of data collected from a large sample of voluntary
participants, on their appreciation of works (peer-to-peer sharing, recommendations,
blog post, etc.). The flat-rate contribution would be of the order of €5 per month per
household in developed countries. This represents about 3-4% of the average cultural
consumption of households, and does not of course aim to replace the other sources
of income listed above. It should provide additional income specifically adapted to
digital culture and its vast number of contributors.

      The limitations of the other mechanisms described above lead some
proponents to defend a scheme whose aspirations go well beyond cultural activities:
unconditional basic income allowance which proposes that every citizen or resident
be guaranteed a basic income or “citizen's income”. Every person could then choose
how to use their time, for example to work to supplement their basic income, or to
volunteer. It could therefore play a fundamental role in sustaining the other
mechanisms.

       The three schemes described above all aim to balance ease of implementation
with the effectiveness of their impact but they differ in their generalisability. La
Quadrature du Net believes that the Creative Contribution scheme is particularly
relevant for the years ahead: it can support voluntary resource pooling and prepare
the ground for more general schemes. There are many different opinions amongst
societal actors, and policy makers have the duty and responsibility to explore how
each option could be put in place and best supported.


73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain
clauses in contracts)?

       Authors and other creative contributors have to be protected against the worst
aberrations of what copyright, invented many centuries before the digital age, has
become. Copyright has to adapt to ensure that it is fair to authors, contributors and
the public, not only in commercial publishing but also in commercial distribution.
For this, the following conditions must be met:
   •   Obligation for a separate digital-rights contract, with limited copyright term
       and which takes advances in technology and digital uses into consideration.
   •   If an edition involves tangible and intangible products, copyright must
       automatically return to the author or contributors if one or both become
       unavailable (after a short delay subsequent to the author's request, six months
       for instance). It is unacceptable that the availability of the digital version
       should allow the publisher to leave the tangible version unavailable.



                                                                                       25
   •   Contractual conditions that prevent the non-commercial distribution by
       authors of works should be prohibited.
   •   Minimum levels of remuneration of authors and contributors for the
       commercial exploitation of their work should be introduced. These should
       consider the greatly reduced overhead and cost of reproduction of intangible
       products.

       Several recent developments in France have not respected these principles and
have disempowered authors and restricted the rights of the public to access cultural
goods. The law on the digital exploitation of out-of-commerce 20th century books
adopted by the French Parliament in March 2012liii sets up a collective system that
applies automatically to all authors and publishers who do not opt-out within six
months after the registration of works in the database managed by the French
National Library (ReLIREliv). This law is a categorical refusal of any form of
non-commercial access, the focus being on commercial exploitation that is
collectively managed and placed under the management of publishers. In this
context, authors can only opt out, while the public loses the possibility to access
works through non-commercial channels. Orphan works represent a significant part
of out-of-commerce books of the 20th century and this new measure is likely to
prevail over measures established by directive 2012/28/EU which had made it
possible to make digital copies of orphan works available non-commercially through
libraries, museums and archives. This directive has not yet been transposed into
French law and France is instead pushing for the extension of these new measures to
the whole of the EU, which would hurt both the rights of authors and that of the
public.

       As a result of an agreement between authors and publishers lv, France is also
getting ready to modify, via a legal ruling, its law relating to publishing contracts in
order to cover digital editions. The planned changes are very limited in terms of the
protection of authors and restrict the possibility for authors to allow the
non-commercial use of their work. For these reasons, it is important that European
legislation explicitly provides guarantees on the supranational level against these
types of contractual clauses.

      In the particular case of academic authors, it is important that publishing
contracts with scientific publishers should not prevent researchers to submit their
work to open-access archives, even in the case of a transfer of rights. The German
2013 law on Free Access could serve as an example for this type of regulation in
Europelvi.




                                                                                     26
V. Respect for rights

    75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more
    efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a
    commercial purpose?

       Possible sanctions against “aiding and abetting” the “infringement on a
commercial scale” represented one of the most dangerous provisions in ACTA. La
Quadrature du Net had helped raise awareness of the dangers to innovation they
represented. Widespread social practices, such as non-commercial online sharing
between individuals, publication of content on public information portals or the
distribution of innovative tools could have been interpreted as “infringement on a
commercial scale”. Internet access and web hosting providers would have been faced
with a significant legal ambiguity that would have made them vulnerable to attacks
from the entertainment industries. They would have been forced to introduce
censorship measures, which would have harmed freedom on the Internet. Moreover,
“commercial scale” was defined in a very broad sense as “direct or indirect economic
or commercial advantage” and failed to distinguish between commercial and
non-commercial infringements of copyright.

       La Quadrature de Net condemns commercial counterfeiting of cultural goods,
but we also consider that the best way to fight it is to legalise online non-commercial
sharing between individuals on a decentralised basis rather than repressive sanctions.
The development of large-scale centralised online sharing platforms which offer
services that are often fee-paying (such as DirectDownload and Streaming) is a direct
consequence of the repression experienced by peer-to-peer networks, BitTorrrent and
even by online link directories that facilitate sharing. A site such as MegaUpload was
a monster created by this war on sharinglvii.

       The legalisation of online non-commercial sharing represents the best way to
fight against commercial counterfeiting by returning to decentralised practices
without having to take recourse to repressive means.


    76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to
    allow for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet
    service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers,
    domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
    infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures
    would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

       It is astonishing that the Commission appears to want to question the
independence of technical intermediaries as their independence is key to protecting
freedom on the Internet. The involvement of Internet access providers, advertising
brokers, payment service providers and domain name registrars was also at the heart
of ACTA, as well as SOPA in the USA, two proposed treaties rejected by
democratically elected representatives after an unprecedented mobilisation of
citizens in defence of online freedom.


                                                                                    27
       The European legal framework relating to the responsibility of technical
intermediaries, derives from directive 2000/31/CE on electronic commerce and is
satisfactory in as much as it does not force technical intermediaries to pro-actively
control or filter content on their networks. European jurisprudence is also very clear
on the fact that one cannot oblige hosting services to investigate content lviii. To come
back on these principles is to open the door to significant pressure by the
entertainment industry. The threat is that technical intermediaries could be obliged
to put in place automated censorship to filter or even delete online content. The
creation of such forms of “private copyright policing” would unavoidably restrict
freedom online.

        La Quadrature du Net is worried to see a reference in the questionnaire to
“cooperative efforts” with technical intermediaries, an expression lifted straight out of
article 27.3 of ACTA. This notion recalls a proposal by France in the context of
Hadopilix and in the conclusions of the Lescure report lx that argued in favour of
legislating responsibility of technical intermediaries on a European level. It would
force technical intermediaries to “auto-regulate” through contractual agreements
with cultural industries brokered by the state. Those who would refuse to
“auto-regulate” would see themselves threatened by various sanctions that could go
all the way to the seizure of their domain name or to censorship by an administrative
authority. The Lescure report furthermore proposed that public institutions support
the research into automatic detection and filtering technologies which already pose a
grave danger to freedom of communication on the Internet. Measures of this type are
already used, for instance Content-ID of YouTube which already blocks content that
is perfectly legal, and which therefore compromises the effective application of
copyright exceptions and limitations. The Hadopi law in France suggests that search
engines should be made to dereference certain websites or censor and block access to
them. These measures derive directly from the worst in ACTA and SOPA. They make
technical intermediaries legally responsible for content, by-pass the judicial system
and represent an evolution towards contractual forms of control of communications
that will lead to a de facto private censorship of the Internet.

      La Quadrature du Net rejects this new repressive approach that risks to be at
the heart of the next law to be debated in France in 2014. We are also worried that
France is pushing for the adoption of “auto-regulation by online platforms” on the
European level (see notably the European Council of 24-25 October 2013 lxi).
European citizens will mobilise again to protest this contractual, back-door version of
ACTA.

    77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the
    right balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright
    respected and other rights such as the protection of private life and
    protection of personal data?
       The Court of Justice of the European Union, in its SABAM vs. Netlog decision
of the 16 February 2012lxii, considered that the current state of European law did not
allow for the imposition on webhosters to establish a generalised surveillance of
communications through their network. This decision based itself on the principle
that copyright protection must not lead to a disproportionate breach of freedom of
expression, nor against privacy. No changes in European legislation should
undermine this balance by harming the protection of personal data and privacy.

                                                                                      28
       Instead, this principle should be better protected in order to avoid what
happened in France. In the context of the graduated response introduced by the
Hadopi Law, a large-scale surveillance of online communications was set up, with the
collection of IP addresses done by agents on the payroll of the entertainment
industry, using techniques developed in secret by private companies. The principle of
the protection of privacy should be reaffirmed with sufficient strength by the
European Union to ensure that such measures cannot be introduced anywhere else.
