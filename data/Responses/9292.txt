   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


      1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
         problems when trying to access online services  in  an  EU  Member
         State other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and

         the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in

         requests per year  and  provide  examples  indicating  the  Member
         State, the sector and the type of content concerned.


[Open question]


Normally this is not relevant for literary translations, but there are some
exceptions for languages shared by two or more countries as Italy/Italian
Switzerland, Germany/Switzerland/Austria, Netherlands/Belgium,
France/Belgium/Switzerland, UK/Ireland etc. In this cases often in
publishing contracts translators cede rights for all countries/regions
which share the same target language.

         where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in
         question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose
         territorial restrictions on a  service  provider  (in  order,  for

         level  to  increase  the  cross-border  availability  of   content
         services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
         protection for right holders?

services.


€ NO OPINION


Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


      8. Is the scope of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
         situations – i.e. when content is disseminated  across  borders  –
         sufficiently clear?


€ YES

◙ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

In our opinion the act of “making available” must be considered to happen
not only in the “targeted country” but  in each of the countries where the
content is potentially accessible. Otherwise it would be too easy for a
service provider to declare targeting only customers residing in a specific
country (on the grounds that promotional activities are directed to them)
while, in reality, exploiting protected content also in other countries.
The “country of origin” approach also has obvious limits. Therefore, to
effectively protect authors’ rights  it is not enough to use a single
criterion (such as the “targeting” one suggested by the Court of Justice of
the European Union) but different ones need to be combined (it is the
result that must be guaranteed, not the facility of use of a certain
method). We stress the fact that the whole structure of copyright
legislation is justified and founded on the necessity to protect authors’
(and performers) rights, therefore any legislative act must have this
primary aim. Of course cross-border online transmission must be
facilitated, but not at the expense of authors.


€ NO OPINION




      9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification
         of the territorial scope of the “making available” right  have  an
         effect on the recognition of your rights  (e.g.  whether  you  are
         considered to be an author or not, whether you are  considered  to
         have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or  on
         the  enforcement  of  rights  (including   the   availability   of
         injunctive relief[24])?


Yes, as we said above it could.


"While a “clarification” (in the case it implied, for example, the  adoption
of a single criterion at the exclusion of others) normally in  Europe  would
be unlikely to determine if somebody is to be considered an author  or  not,
considering the specificities of the different national  copyright  laws  it
could easily  affect  the  recognition  of  some  author's  rights  and  the
possibility to defend them.  Therefore  we  ask  the  EU  to  establish  the
principle that if ever, in any case, the choice of one or another  criterion
to determine where or when the act of “making available” takes place  should
affect the enjoyment or cause the loss of any one of the moral and  economic
rights the author is entitled to according to international and/or  EU  laws
or, even worst, the application of  such  a  criterion  should  deprive  the
author of his authorial status, the above said criterion must be  considered
invalid and inapplicable in that specific case (as it  is  inconceivable  to
leave to anyone “territorial loopholes” to violate the fundamental  authors’
rights). Therefore  a pre-condition for any criterion the UE might  wish  to
adopt to determine where the act of “making available”  (or  any  other  act
relevant for on-line transmission and usage of content) takes place must  be
the assurance that it does  not  diminish  in  any  way  the  protection  of
authors’ rights, not only as  regards  the  theoretic  recognition  of  such
rights but also with regard  to  the  possibility  for  the  author  to  use
injunctive relief and any other law enforcement  instrument.


In particular, regarding the governing law and the forum of jurisdiction  in
case of conflict, it must be assured that  if  ever  the  application  of  a
certain criterion should lead to an  applicable  law  or  jurisdiction  less
favorable to the author or performer than the law of his country or  another
applicable law or  jurisdiction  which  would  have  been  determined  using
another criterion (because, for example in a given country some  rights  are
not recognized or the injunctive relief obtained in another country  is  not
enforceable or for any other reason), it must be possible to apply the  more
favorable criterion in order to restore and  protect  all  of  the  authors’
rights. We must leave no possibility  to  rights  exploiters  to  do  “forum
shopping”  by  studying  methods  of  “guiding”  the  contract  towards  the
jurisdiction more favorable to them against authors’ interests.


Besides this, any clarification must include the duty to  name  all  authors
or the work which is made available, especially important  in  the  case  of
literary or media translators who are very often forgotten.

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


     10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:]  Does
         the application  of  two  rights  to  a  single  act  of  economic
         exploitation in the online environment (e.g.  a  download)  create
         problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


◙ NO


No, on the contrary: distinguishing between the two rights is useful to
check that authors/performers receive a fair remuneration. There is no
reason why the two rights might not be licensed together if the

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

     11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to  a  work  or  other
         subject matter protected under copyright,  either  in  general  or
         under specific circumstances, be subject to the  authorisation  of
         the rightholder?

€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,

it should be covered by a copyright exception)

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


……………………………………………………………………………………………….

€ NO


€ NO OPINION


  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.


The problem is that, differently from what happens with  the  resale  of   a
physical copy (like the resale of one book), in which the seller  loses  the
original copy, it is extremely difficult to make sure that  a  digital  file
is resold only one time  or  check  exactly  how  many  copies  are  resold.
Therefore  before  enabling  the  resale  of  previously  purchased  digital
content, it is necessary to find criteria and systems to address this  risks
and ensure that authors and performers rights  are  not  cancelled.  Perhaps
one  of  these  criteria  (although  in  no  way  sufficient)  could  be  to
distinguish between different types of  potential  re-sellers,  allowing  to
resale one copy to private persons but not to companies).  It  also  appears
necessary to find a system to indemnify authors/performers for the  loss  of
a quota or profits that (however hard one might try to contrast  abuses)  is
certain to happen.


The issue is very complex and need much  reflexion  before  one  can  really
give an answer to this question.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES


◙ NO  There is no need, on the contrary any such system might introduce
complications and costs for authors and put possible obstacles and
formalities between them and the rights which the law automatically grants
them upon creation of his work. The refuse of any formality for the
enjoyment of copyright is one of the foundations of the European copyright
laws, and we believe it is a sound one.


€ NO OPINION





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


We are against not only any formality as a condition for the protection and
exercise of rights (which would be illegal) but also to any optional system
of registration that would give advantages to the registered works or their
authors in respect to non-registered works and to authors not interested in
such a system.


To impose (as an obligation for the enjoyment of rights but also to access
to certain benefits) any kind of registration might expose authors and
performers to complications or costs and  disadvantage them in respect to
publishers, producers, broadcasters etc. who, due to their greater means
and organization, would find it easier to meet the registration
requirements. It would be a step backwards, in the opposite direction to
the one we need to take, which is to put back authors and performers at the
center of the copyright system and to reduce the enormous imbalance between
the rights authors actually enjoy and the rights enjoyed by the exploiters
of their works (the rights’ transferees).





  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


None, we will oppose any attempt to push authors to registration that might
give them advantages over other authors.


How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

◙ YES AND NO – Please explain


It is not so much the length but the SENSE of copyright protection that
must be discussed.


The problem is that, considering the state of things today, the length of
the term of copyright protection puts in evidence the enormous gap between
the profits that the protected works bring to the rights transferees
(publishers, producers, broadcasters etc.) and the crumbs authors receive.
For authors and performers it is much more important to obtain a real and
effective recognition of their rights during their lifetime rather than to
enjoy them (or rather let others enjoy them) for a long post mortem period!



One thing the EU should do is to establish a provision giving to the heirs
of authors and performers the possibility to ask for the revision or
resolution of grossly unfair contracts and the reversion of rights (in some
member states there are contract law provisions to address unfair terms in
contracts transferring copyright. Also the possibility of ‘rights
reversion’ exists in some member states for a number of reasons; these
should be extended to heirs of authors).


Since the term of copyright protection is so long, and the protected works
cannot be freely used on the pretext of protecting authors’ rights (while
it is clear that the author cannot enjoy these rights in the afterlife) the
minimum action to take to redress the situation would be to make it
mandatory that at least part of the profits derived by the works to go to
the authors’ heirs. There have been and there are court cases, in different
countries, where authors’ descendants fight against corporations (rights
transferees) to be able at least to use their fathers works, whose rights
have been taken away from the author during his lifetimes by rights
transferees with unfair agreements.


So, regarding the term of copyright protection, in addition to what stated
above, it would be good to introduce a discrimination between the cases in
which the protection gives profits to  author’s heirs as well as to
transferees (in which case the current protection term is adequate) and
those cased in which the protection gives profits only to transferees (not
to the authors or their heirs, where such a long term appears unjustified
and should be reduced  (this would also improve contractual practice).


With regard to the necessity to distinguish between authors and performers
(rightholders “ab origine”) and rightholders in general (category which
includes rights’ transferees or “secondary” rightholders) please see our
answer to question n. 80 (other issues).

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

◙ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


Limitations and exceptions should be harmonized by adopting  clear  criteria
throughout the internal market, for example in defining what are the  social
and professional uses and contexts where they  can  be  applied  (libraries,

      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[41] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[42].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[43].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

Agreements (mostly  made  with  collecting  societies)  exist  only  in  few
countries  and,  even  where  there  are,  often  literary  translators  are
neglected, or the distribution systems of the collecting societies  are  not
fair, adequate and transparent for all authors/rightowners  (especially  not
for literary translators).


But models of  commercial  e-lending  are  being  developed  by  exploiters,
publishers and distributors with different modes  of  payment  (flat  rates,
subscription etc.) , so there is a need to guarantee  fair  remuneration  of
these uses for the authors.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[44].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [49].

The Marrakesh Treaty[50] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[51] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[52].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when
      trying to use text or data mining methods, including across borders?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced

◙ YES – Please explain


Since form text and data mining can come new content and new profits, also
in this flied we must apply the basic principle: every use of a copyright
protected work (at least from companies and for commercial ends) should be
licensed and should have the authorisation by the author(s), and the
author(s) must get fair remuneration for every use of their work – this
should be applied for data mining etc. too, for instance: the “snippets”
Google shows, are the result of a sort of data analysis too! And finally
creators/authors should have a share in profit if providers or other
exploiters generate profit form publicity placement nearby the used works.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[53]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[54].

      experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing  works  or  other
      subject matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
      across borders?

◙ YES – Please explain by giving examples


We take the occasion of this question to focus, for once, on  the  neglected
moral rights (neglected but not less important for authors, and having  also
indirect economic consequences). Every day we experience problems  resulting
from the way  internet  users  deal  with  our  works  to  disseminate  (and
publicize) new content on the  Internet,  across  borders  but  also  inside
national borders as it is a very common practice (although illegal)  to  use
quotations (or even long parts) of literary translations without  mentioning
the translator’s name (and sometimes not even the original  author’s  name).
The main problem are not “normal” users (meaning people who  use  the  works
for their personal blogs, with no commercial ends, and  who  perhaps  ignore
copyright law, although they  should  not),  the  problem  is  the  mass  of
(supposed) professionals who are authors themselves or make  a  living  with
the work of authors  (journalists,  critics,  reviewers,  etc.)  who  ignore
literary translators’ rights (even though the  Italian  law  states  clearly
that it is mandatory, in any quotation of  a  translation,  to  mention  the
source, the name of the original author and of the translator).

  59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:]
      Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you
      have  created  (on  the  basis  of  pre-existing  works)  is  properly
      identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in  this
      context?


Literary  translators  (and  we  think  also  illustrators)  find   specific
problems when signing agreements directly with writers  to  translate  their
books (which happens more  and  more  with  the  growth  of  self-publishing
technology). The problem arises when the writer asks  for  the  transfer  of
rights on the translation (signing a contract with the translator) with  the
intention  to  use  and  exploit  the  translation  directly,  Many  on-line
platforms for self-publishing do not respect copyright law because  they  do
not provide authors with (and oblige them to use)  spaces  for  putting  the
translator’s name in case of a  translated  work  (therefore  violating  the
law, subtracting visibility to the translator and  making  it  difficult  to
properly identify the work, in case of a book of which several  translations
have been made). Also some platforms ask writers  to  sing  agreements  with
them (to upload their works  or  the  translations  and  sell  them  on  the
platform) governed by national copyrights law  (for  example  US,  but  also
some European laws as  Luxembourg  law)  which  do  not  protect  adequately
writers’ and translators’ rights (in other  cases  the  contracts  have  any
provision about the governing law and jurisdiction,  counting  on  the  fact
that in certain cases the law of the nation  where  the  server  is  becomes
applicable and so on). Time has come to deal with  the  situation  otherwise
we’ll come to the creation of a “no man’s land” on internet, when  protected
works can be sold and used with no concern for authors’ (and  in  particular
translators and illustrators) rights.

  62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?

[Open question]

It is necessary to reinforce the obligation, at a  European  level,  to  put
the translator’s name every time a reference is made to  a  translated  work
(for commercial or non-commercial  purposes),  in  any  type  of  use  of  a
translated work, dissertation about it or quotation from it.

Regarding  newspaper  articles,  the  newspaper  publisher  must  share  the
responsibility of infringements with  the  journalist  and  strong  measures
(with strong fines) must be established for violations.  It  must  be  given
the possibility, in these cases, to authors associations to undertake  legal
actions (as well as to authors to undertake collective actions).

The same must apply to online  platforms  for  self-publishing  and  of  any
kind.


  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


In addition to what we said above, in order to remedy to  the  ignorance  of
the average internet user and, in the same time, to make  him  realize  that
not mentioning the author’s name is an infringement of the law; it could  be
made mandatory for all companies/internet  sites  who  provide  blogging  or
similar  services,  or  that  allow  users  to  publish  on  personal  pages
protected content (drawings, comics, texts, translations, artistic  pictures
etc.) to put a  banner  (or  a  decorative  window  or  any  other  element,
provided that it remains at the top of the page and cannot be closed),  with
an advertisement, a sort of "proclaimer" (an assumption  of  responsibility,
the contrary of “disclaimer"), saying something like:


“The owner of this site, a mindful citizen of an information-based  society,
asks and undertakes to ensure respect for her/his own  creations  and  those
of others. S/he therefore undertakes (and requests that those  who  use  the
site also undertake) always to indicate, in compliance  with  the  law,  the
authors of the works mentioned and used: writers, translators,  cartoonists,
designers, graphic  artists,  photographers,  authors  and  artists  of  all
kinds.”


This is just an example, what’s needed is a  short  and  clear  text  to  be
translated in all EU languages and used in all EU  countries,  which  should
become common through all internet, like a mantra!



  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[55]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[56][57].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[61].

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[62] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[63]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?


To  ensure  that  authors  receive  an   adequate   remuneration   for   the
exploitation of their works we need a combination of  mechanisms  acting  at
three levels:
1) general EU copyright legislation
2) contracts
3) law enforcement.

As regards the contractual and law enforcement levels, we give  our  opinion
at questions 73 and 75.
With regard to the general legislative framework, the EU should establish  a
set of key mandatory principles stating:
1) the right for authors and  performers  to  a  fair  remuneration.  It  is
necessary to define criteria on the  basis  of  which  remuneration  may  be
considered fair; these criteria must include:
-  a share of profits (royalties) for authors and translators; it is not  to
be considered fair – except on few and precisely enumerated cases, e.g.  the
transfer of the right to publish newspaper articles  which  do  not  have  a
long-living economic interest – any payment consisting only in  a  lump  sum
(as is often the case with translations);
- a fair remuneration or financial compensation for every  single  use  made
of their works, especially for every use  of  digital  rights,  because  too
often literary translators don’t  get  any  remuneration  for  these  rights
(usually  in  Italy  publishers  impose  contracts  where  the   translators
transfer for 20 years – and sometimes forever  –  all  their  rights  for  a
(ridiculous) lump sum.
2) the impossibility for national laws to  consent  any  derogation  of  the
basic principles (the Italian copyright law is full of  provisions  followed
by “unless otherwise agreed”), with regard to  economic  and  moral  rights.
Moral rights today are often overlooked in the  debate  on  copyright  while
they must remain the heart  of  the  European  copyright  system  (or,  more
precisely “droit d’auteur” system). We must reaffirm, at  a  EU  level,  the
inalienability  and  non-transferability  of  these  rights.  Today  certain
national laws elude the principles of  international  copyright  conventions
and EU laws providing for certain exceptions (e.g. Luxembourg copyright  law
lets the author, through a specific agreement in  contract,  to  assign  the
entirety or part of moral rights  to  the  transferee,  a  possibility  some
multinational corporations, such as Amazon, are already exploiting)!

To  strengthen  the  EU  commitment  to  adequately  protect   authors   and
performers, who see their power further weakened  in  the  digital  age,  we
call  for  the  adoption  of  a  specific  directive  or,  better  still,  a
regulation. The EU has issued several copyright  directives  but  none  that
reinforce the very foundations of copyright: the need to protect the  rights
of AUTHORS (as distinct from “rightholders”  in  general)  and  ensure  that
they are guaranteed the dignity of living on the proceeds of their work.  EU
has considered necessary to enact the “Directive for  the  harmonization  of
certain  aspects  of  copyright  and  related  rights  in  the   information
society”; time has come for a “Directive for  the  effective  protection  of
authors’ and  performers’  rights  in  the  information  society”.   Such  a
directive shall establish binding legal principles elevating  the  standards
of  national  copyright  laws,  contractual   provisions   and   civil   law
enforcement systems.

  73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?

◙ YES – Please explain

At the EU level we must establish:
1) Mandatory contractual standards that, among other  things,  specify  that
any  contract  proposed  unilaterally  by  the  rights  transferee  (e.g.  a
publisher), who declares its  terms  to  be  non-negotiable  (an  imposition
contrary  to  the  basic  principles  of  international  contract  law   but
extremely  common)  is  not  valid.  EU  should  send   recommendations   to
publishers associations asking them to check and monitor  specifically  this
serious  breach  of  law  (in  Italy   many   times   publishers   blackmail
translators, refusing to work with them if they do not  declare  the  false,
signing contracts that say the parts “agree upon  the  following  terms  and
condition…” while all the terms are imposed by the publisher.  We  have  lot
of documentation to prove this  (our  organization  provides  a  service  of
legal counsel for translators – member and not members).
2)  An  obligation  for  associations  of   authors   and   performers   and
associations of rights transferees (publishers, producers, broadcasters)  to
agree (and apply) codes of usages (as in France),  model  contracts  (as  in
other countries) etc., also following  the  recommendations  of  the  recent
study commissioned by the European Parliament on the  subject:  “Contractual
arrangements applicable to creators: law and  practice  of  selected  member
states”.
In order to avoid the circumvention of this obligation, in the countries  in
which authors  or  individual  categories  of  authors  do  not  have  their
representative association, the European directive should  provide  for  the
possibility  that  representation   is   entrusted   to   another   European
association of authors or, in the case of translators,  to  the  CEATL  (the
best way to ensure representation can be better defined  but  the  principle
is important).
3) To exempt creators, authors, literary translators from all kind of  anti-
trust restrictions - individually working artists are not enterprises,  they
don’t have any power on markets (on the contrary, they represent the  weaker
part to be protected).
4) The licensing of rights for the use  of  a  work  (in  our  case  of  the
translation)  shall  be  limited  in  time  (maximum  10  years  for   paper
publishing and maximum 5 years for digital publishing, today in Italy it  is
20 years for the transfer of all rights in publishing  contracts)  to   give
authors the opportunity, after a certain period, to  renegotiate  the  terms
agreed (and often in reality imposed or,  in  any  case,  bargained  from  a
weaker position).
5) The licensing of  rights  should  be  subject  to  the  restrictions  and
duration of the licensed rights  of  the  original  work.  Buy-out-contracts
must be made illegal.
6) The EU must establish the requirement of a written form for the  contract
for purpose of evidence or validity of the transfer of rights (in Italy  the
law requires the written form for purpose of evidence).
7) The possibility of termination of contract, and therefore of a  reversion
of  rights  to  the  author   under   different   circumstances   (lack   of
exploitation, exploitation against the author's interests,  lapse  of  time,
bankruptcy of the transferee etc.)
8) As recommended in the above mentioned study commissioned by the  European
Parliament,  “Contractual  arrangements  applicable  to  creators:  law  and
practice of selected member states” we also ask for the introduction  of  an
“unfair terms model” (a “blacklist” of  prohibited  contractual  provisions)
in copyright law. As the document says: “By analogy to consumer  protection,
such a scheme would preclude “black” terms (determined in the law)  as  well
as any provision causing a significant imbalance in the parties' rights  and
obligations arising under the contract  to  the  detriment  of  the  author.
Legal provisions on unfair terms, primarily a tool  of  consumer  protection
law, are based on the existence of uneven bargaining  positions.  A  similar
imbalance can be found, by analogy, in copyright contracts. Hungary,  Sweden
and Germany apply  contract  law  provisions  to  address  unfair  terms  in
contracts transferring copyright. This measure should  be  generalized  Also
representatives of authors  should  be  entitled  to  challenge  contractual
practices concerning authors before courts by collective action.”

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[64] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[65].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[66]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[67].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

◙ YES – Please explain


The civil enforcement system should be rendered more efficient not only  for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose but  for  all
infringements of copyright, for whatever  purpose  (in  particular  for  the
infringement of moral rights).


Whenever  a  conflict   arises   between   authors/performers   and   rights
transferees  (publishers,  producers,  broadcaster)  or  internet   services
providers of access to on-line content, authors/performers must be  granted,
in all member states and at  EU  level,  the  possibility  of  a  collective
lawsuit (a sort of “class action”) and also the right to be  represented  by
their associations, as individual authors/literary translators often  cannot
afford the cost of a lawsuit or the risk of losing their commissioners.

  76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear  enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

◙ YES – Please explain


We do not consider these rights as being in conflict. We do not see how  the
protection of copyright might be in conflict with the protection of  private
life and of personal data (unless  you  refer  to  possible  obligations  to
“trace” one’s  movements  due  to  “anti-piracy”  measures,  in  which  case
certainly it is necessary not to recur to invasive methods, but we all  know
that a certain degree of traceability is, in any case, necessary  to  ensure
other public needs, such as anti-terrorism, anti-child exploitation etc.).

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


◙ NO – See explanation below.


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?


We are contrary to the proposal of a unified EU copyright title that  “would
totally harmonize the area of copyright law in the EU and  replace  national
laws” with the consequence that there would be a “single  EU  title  instead
of a bundle of national rights”, at the moment or in the  near  future,  for
the following reasons:

“Harmonization” must be a mean (to defend the rights of authors and  society
as a whole), not an end. For authors the objective to “harmonize” rights  is
not urgent nor desirable at all costs. Our only real  need  is  to  see  our
rights  reinforced  and  finally  really  protected,  not   to   have   them
“harmonized” at an inadequate level (as it would inevitably happen  if  this
“harmonization” was achieved today or in the next years). If  and  when  the
European copyright legislative framework will become adequate  and  it  will
offer a SUPERIOR (and not inferior) degree  of  protection  to  authors  and
performers than the protection offered by the BEST member states  laws  (the
only ones to be takes as examples), then it will  be  possible  to  envision
the hypothesis of single EU copyright title.

To proceed to a total harmonization before this end is achieved would  cause
damage because while today an author enjoys on his works:
1) all basic rights established by international  and  European  conventions
and laws (so in reality we already  have  a  sort  of  basic  “international
title”) PLUS
2)  all  additional  rights  granted  him  by  his/her  country’s   national
copyright law (few countries do not provide a  higher  protection  than  the
basic protection assured by the “least common denominator”)…
…in the hypothesis of a single European Title (which  implies  a  single  EU
copyright code) the authors would be left with the  minimum  protection.  WE
STRESS THE  FACT  THAT  THERE  ARE  EUROPEAN  COPYRIGHT  LAWS  (SUCH  AS  IN
LUXEMBOURG)  SO  INADEQUATE  THAT  THEY  DO  NOT  EVEN  GRANT  AUTHORS   THE
PROTECTION OF THEIR MORAL RIGHTS.

Would authors gain anything from an  harmonization  at  the  low  end  that,
certainly,  would  make  right  transfer  simpler  and  things  easier   for
technological businesses and some rightholders (right’s transferees such  ad
publishers, producers and broadcaster operating at an  international  level)
but at the cost of sacrificing authors’ rights? Certainly not.

Therefore, unless EU establishes (by binding provisions) adequate  standards
adopting the measures already discussed about law and  contracts,  we  think
the best way  to  protect  authors’  rights  and  interests  (and  also  the
interests of civil society as a whole,  which  is  not  assimilable  to  the
“single market” as citizens are not to be  reduced  to  “consumers”)  is  to
promote harmonization  of  copyright  in  so  far  as  it  is  necessary  to
guarantee the respect of  its  fundamental  rules  and  of  author’s  rights
(still largely violated). Aside from this,  it  is  necessary   to  leave  a
certain degree of  flexibility  and  specificity  in  Member  States’  legal
systems (which must, however, be reviewed in order to ensure  that  they  do
not leave “ways out”  allowing  the  violation  of  rights,  as  it  happens
today).

To sum up, we fear that today (and in the near future)  a  single  copyright
code or title would imply the risk (almost the certainty) of lowering  (down
levelling) authors’ rights, while elevating even more profits  for  economic
subjects such as rights transferees and  web  services  providers  (reducing
for them the “complications”, that is to say the need  to  worry  to  obtain
the authors’ consent and to remunerate them for the use of their work).


VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.


It is necessary, in all discussions on the EU legal framework on  copyright,
to give priority to the  essential  purpose  of  copyright  legislation:  to
protect the rights of authors, allowing them to live of  their  work.  Today
copyright and copyright laws, rather than being really  used  to  this  end,
have mostly  become  instruments  through  which  various  branches  of  the
culture industry (publishers, producers,  broadcasters  etc..)  reserve  for
themselves exclusive areas of huge profits, of which  authors  receive  only
crumbs.

It is significant that even in this consultation document the  issues  of  a
fair remuneration for authors, respect of rights, and the complex  issue  of
the single EU copyright title are put at the end!

We also oppose the general tendency to refer both to authors  and  to  those
who exploit authors’ work (rights’ transferees) as “rightholders”.
This homologation is at the root of many  evils  and  authors  (rightholders
“ab origine”, as creators of the works) often are  not  correctly  perceived
by public opinion because their interests are wrongly identified with  those
of the  exploiters  of  rights’  transferees  (secondary  rightholders,  who
acquire rights “by way of transfer”).

This means that while various international and national laws, not to  speak
of EU directives, have endless provisions to protect the economic rights  of
rights   transferees   (secondary   rightholders)   -   sometimes    in    a
disproportionate  and  obsessive  way,  which  exasperates  people  -    the
provisions to ensure fair conditions for the  transfer  of  right  are  few,
weak and scarcely enforceable.

Therefore a key issue to be addressed is the need to distinguish, and  bring
to the center of attention and legislative  action,  authors  (as  creators,
rightholders   “ab   origine”)   as   distinct   from   other   rightholders
(rightholders on a secondary basis) in order to:
- establish criteria and minimum  standards  for  the  transfer  of  rights,
first of all at a contractual level;
- place a ceiling on  the  gap  between  the  profits  gained  by  secondary
rightholders (rights’ transferees) and the part of these profits  that  goes
to authors and their heirs;
- establish an obligation, for all EU member states, to create a body  (with
representative of all categories  of  authors  and  rightholders  (in  which
secondary rightholders may not outnumber  primary rightholder and where  all
members must  have  equal  power)  to  monitor  the  compliance  with  these
principles and make periodic reports to Brussels.

cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

[45] France and  Germany  have  already  adopted  legislation  to  back  the
effects of the MoU. The French  act  (LOI  n°  2012-287  du  1er  mars  2012
relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe  siècle)
foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher  in  question
opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption  of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are  not  members
of the collecting society.
