                            the review of the EU copyright rules




                                                                         March 2014

Introduction


ETNO, the leading trade association in Brussels for telecoms operators, welcomes the
current public consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules and thanks the
EU Commission for the opportunity to provide views.

ETNO considers that the dramatic changes brought about by the Internet era may
challenge the current regulatory regime for copyright and believes that it is therefore
appropriate that the EU Commission questions the adequacy of the current regime in
the digital context. Notwithstanding these new challenges, ICT is an enabler of new
content distribution mechanisms and services and as such, ETNO members are
investing heavily to ensure that the underlying infrastructure is in place to support
this innovation. ETNO believes that all players benefitting from the digital
environment should contribute to it growth and investment.

As a preliminary consideration, ETNO reaffirms that copyright is fundamental to
innovation and copyright owners need to be properly remunerated for their works.
As a representative of one of the most innovative industry, ETNO supports a sound
regulatory framework for copyright and an appropriate protection mechanism. At
the same time, the enormous opportunities and facilities granted by ICT and the
Internet in terms of social and economic welfare need to be equally supported,
through a regulatory framework that fosters investment and the provision of
innovative services. As such, ETNO considers that the forthcoming new European
Commission and Parliament terms, and the needed revision of the Digital Agenda
objectives (as proposed by the Greek Presidency of the EU in its Program for the
semester (the so-called “Mid-term review”), are a unique opportunity to strike a
sound balance of equally relevant interests and to establish a legal framework that is
fit for purpose in the digital environment.

Below, we provide responses to those questions within the consultation which are of
direct relevance to ETNO members.


Q2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when
seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?
  YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to
copyright or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of
providing services across borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer
protection)? Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV
series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and
newspapers, games, applications and other software).



Cross-border availability of content is essential for the development of cross-border
services and must be facilitated. This applies to two different situations: 1. when
customers have subscribed to online services in the Member State of their residence
and want to access these services when travelling temporarily abroad (via roaming,
wi-fi connections, fixed access etc) and 2. when customers wish to access content
distributed by a foreigner provider in other countries.

The fact that copyright and licensing schemes are nationally based, often with
content providers requiring geo-filtering and restrictive licences for national
territories, is certainly an obstacle to the achievement of the European single market.
Barriers to providing services also exist due to national cultures and languages, the
need for the adoption of open standards for content delivery, the cost of compliance
with different national consumer laws and fiscal regulations, the costs of providing
customer care in several languages, the risk of fraud and non-payments and the
diverse economic realities which can have price implications.

National cultures and languages
European content is nationally segmented because content is usually related to
national culture and language. This is particularly the case for audio-visual works.
Subtitling and dubbing films helps to overcome the associated difficulties but these
solutions carry a cost which online distributors are not always ready to support,
particularly when the consumer interest is low. Even for marketing and budget
reasons, European works are not as attractive as US works outside their country of
origin and this is true not only for television programmes but also for most films.

Considering these barriers, distributors will typically not take the risk of financing
films produced in other Member States and it is also difficult for those distributors to
find interested advertisers. In this context, distributors are legitimately reluctant to
undertake the international online provision of national content in other Member
States of the EU.

Standards for content delivery
Many standardisations activities are developed in order to enable the provisioning of
NGA/NGN services across networks in a multi-carrier environment. Some of these

ETNO Reflection Document RD403 (2014/02)                                             2
standards dedicated to future networks could also offer greater facilities for content
delivery and the online distribution of audio-visual media services. In particular,
ETNO believes that there is a need for Europe to promote open and interoperable
standards for IP-based Quality of Service Interconnection (such as IPX).

Standardization is also necessary to achieve convergence in the audio-visual
business. Standardization processes should involve all stakeholders in the value
chain, from content providers to ISPs and home network technology vendors and
including transit network operators.

Industry initiatives should be accompanied by Institutional efforts focused on
achieving and ensuring the adoption of open standards for online services. The
European Commission should, however, refrain from mandating any standard
which has not proven to be widely accepted by the market as mandating standards
can hinder innovation. The promotion of standards via bodies such as ETSI could
foster the market penetration of standards on a voluntary basis and thereby help to
achieve more interoperability.

Consumer protection laws
Notwithstanding the Citizens Rights Directive, to be implemented this summer, the
laws regulating consumer contracts are varied across Member States and constitute
obvious barriers to cross-border trade.

Personal data protection and privacy
Creating, promoting and adopting a global set of principles based on a harmonised
and consistent approach to privacy would benefit users, who should benefit from the
same level of protection no matter where they are based nor which and where the
provider is, and should ensure that European businesses can compete on the same
level playing field with US market leaders. Harmonisation would greatly reduce
privacy compliance costs which is an important step for the take-up of new activities
in the European Union, such as cloud computing.

On this issue, ETNO welcomes the ambitious plan to revise the European data
protection rules.

Tax issues
The current tax system is an obstacle to the development of cross-border content
offers as US companies distributing content cross-border may escape EU tax
obligations. The changes in the EU VAT rules are an important step in the (right)
direction to limit VAT-forum shopping for those players, such as foreign ‘Over the
Top’ players, that are not linked by establishment in a specific EU country.

Security
Some content typologies such as music or editorial works (eg eBooks) require, for
their distribution and use by the end-user, the adoption of specific security
requirements, for instance DRMs, which are not regulated in the same way in all
Member States. A higher harmonisation in this field would help the distribution and
use of content across borders.



ETNO Reflection Document RD403 (2014/02)                                           3
Collective rights management
The legislation applicable to the royalties that collecting societies collect for the
distribution and use of a specific content varies across the EU. Moreover, in the event
of cross-border services, it would be necessary to avoid a duplication of the payment
obligation due to the collecting society.

Q4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above –
what would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
High price and the lack of availability of content is the key domestic/national market
barrier today in Europe for watching on-demand/online content. Naturally, from
this follows that access to on-demand/online content across territories becomes even
more cumbersome and restrictive due to territorial copyright restrictions, licensing
conduct, geo-blocking, price discrimination, hold-back practices and windowing1.
For ETNO, transparency in the process of establishing “who owns what rights” is
key, as is the identification of the collection society(ies) or the rights-holders which
are competent to grant a license. In particular, collecting societies must improve their
processes and content distributors should not be responsible for verification.
This lack of clarity is amplified by the cross-border scale of the business. Developing
cross-border services requires that providers repeat costly and time consuming
negotiations to clear rights with collecting societies in each Member State where the
service will be made available.
In relation to on-line music content, ETNO hopes that the future Directive on
Collective Rights Management will help to solve some of the relevant problems such
as a lack of transparency, excessive transaction costs in the negotiation and
implementation of license agreements with collecting societies, lack of clarity on
rights’ ownership and the complexity of rights management. However, as important
as the Directive will be, the implementation of its provisions by Member States will
be key. Therefore, ETNO calls on the Commission to closely monitor the different
national transposition processes to ensure that the principles of transparency,
accountability and governance set by the Directive are fully embedded into future
national laws governing collecting societies.
As regards the introduction of pan-European licenses for audio-visual works
covering the entire EU footprint, ETNO questions whether it would be an
appropriate solution because it would most likely not suit the reality of the market.
In addition, pan-European licensing would impose on distributors the clearance of
very expensive rights available in 28 Member States with no guarantee of a return on
investment in each of them (return from consumers' subscriptions, advertising, etc).
This would rather tend to favour large players that are already established in the
market or those which have the economic capacity to bear the related investments.

  A recent study (Ericsson ConsumerLab TV & Media) highlights that amongst the top national barriers to watch
on-demand TV/Video content are: the price for on-demand TV/Video is too expensive; poor selection of available
on-demand TV/Video (titles being not relevant or too old); the on-demand TV/Video content is not available on
main TV screen; accessing and watching on-demand TV/Video content takes too long and is cumbersome



ETNO Reflection Document RD403 (2014/02)                                                                  4
The revision of the EU licensing schemes should therefore consider the current
market structure in order not to grant competitive advantages to selected players.
Further, ETNO recommends that a review of the release windows system is carried
out at EU level in order to grant innovative uses of the rights and a wider
distribution of digital works. This would also help reducing digital piracy, which is
mainly due to the lack of legal offer. In addition, hold-back and exclusivity clauses
should be put in the spotlight with a view to identifying barriers and addressing any
problems.


Q7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border
availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate
level of protection for right holders?
 YES – Please explain
Before assessing the need for further measures, a comment on the justification for
additional measures is required. ETNO offers four distinct reasons that justify further
interventions:

      Any would-be improvement of cross-border availability of content services
       must start with the assessment of national content availability and in
       particular the availability of digital on-demand/on-line content, since this is a
       prerequisite for effective cross-border content dissemination and also is an
       existing policy imperative for the Digital Single Market. In other words, an
       EU-wide synchronized DVD release schedule is neither relevant nor a
       sufficient ambition of the EU Digital Agenda and the EU Digital Single
       Market.
      From a territorial/Member State perspective, increased availability of digital
       on-demand/online content is also relevant to narrow down the national
       cultural gap in terms of access to physical content in urban vs. rural areas,
       since access to cultural outlets, such as cinemas, theatres and opera houses is
       significantly more limited in rural areas. Not only will increased digital
       creative content availability of on-demand/on-line distribution increase the
       opportunities for rural European regions to enjoy culture and hereby foster
       cultural inclusion but furthermore it will increase the opportunity to spread
       cultural diversity across the EU frontier.
      From a consumer point of view, accessing culture and entertainment via
       physical and/or appointment based methods comes with following short
       comings:
           - the physical availability is restricted to certain locations, to certain
               days, certain times of the day and the amount of available seats, which
               limits consumption opportunities,
           - physical screen limitations (number of screens per theatre/city)
               restrict the range of titles available at any given time, which excludes
               non-block-buster types of films, such as independent creations,
               regional and local productions which limits cultural diversity.
      Given the socio-economic effects described in section one, ETNO would
       argue that it is in the public interest to balance the self-interest of creative
       sectors with the aim of promoting open and competitive markets in digital


ETNO Reflection Document RD403 (2014/02)                                             5
         on-demand/on-line content. The review of the copyright system should aim
         to increase the availability of more legitimate pan-European digital content
         services, in ways and at prices which are appealing to consumers and to
         decrease digital cultural exclusion.

What should the interventions aim to achieve?

According to a recent World Economic Forum Publication2, expanding access to
content means offering “a wide range of means for the public to reach content, enabled by
the Internet and other technologies, maximizing societal and economic benefit”. The need to
increase the availability of content is also acknowledged by leading insiders of the
creative industry, according to which “Audience wants the freedom…they want
control….give consumers what they want, when they want it and in the format they want it
and at reasonable price..”3

ETNO believes that the availability of on-demand/on-line digital content for
territorial and cross-border dissemination can be increased by addressing the
complete absence of legal digital alternatives in the first release window, limiting the
length of exclusive first release windows and prohibiting the use of exclusive
windows for films with less than 100 copies (the number is relative to size of the
home cinema market) in the theatres.4 In addition, one could look at:

              -    Assuring technology neutral public funding schemes of European
                   audiovisual productions, allowing digital first windows to emerge e.g.
                   prohibit digital on-demand/on-line discrimination.
              -    Regulating the growing practice of Hold Back Practices, as some
                   distributors can obtain from rights-holders the holding back of VOD
                   rights during the whole TV exploitation. Holdback periods are
                   currently not regulated and hence depend on contractual negotiations
                   which have important drawbacks for VOD aggregators, as it hollows
                   out the breadth and depth of a VOD content library.
              -    Introducing a harmonized VAT-rate for audio-visual and other
                   creative services and products across the EU frontiers. This VAT rate
                   should apply regardless of the distribution channel or platform used
                   to distribute digital or physical content.
              -    Increasing market efficiency to clear European works more effectively
                   across EU/EES territories by decreasing search, matching and clearing
                   transaction costs e.g. via a registry, data base or similar.



Q8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e.
when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
  NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification
would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country
of origin" approach5)

  The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that must
be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member State in

Since some ETNO members report issues in this area, a clarification of scope would
be welcome.


Q10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application
of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g.
a download) create problems for you?
  YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address
such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different
hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")
The application of two rights for one act of exploitation may create problems with
regards to the distribution of content by providers. In the past, both rights (the right
of reproduction and the right of making available) which are necessary for the online
and mobile exploitation of music were granted by the respective collecting societies
in Europe. As a result of the EU Recommendation of 2005, Anglo-American music
publishers withdrew their right of reproduction from the collective management by
collecting societies. The right of making available for the respective musical works
remained within collective management. Therefore, the situation now is that both
licensing systems - collective rights management and single licensing - apply for one
musical work used in one economic process. The aim of facilitating the licensing
process for the content provider through collective rights management is
jeopardised. Although rights managers, such as CELAS for the EMI Publishing
repertoire, are licensing the corresponding making available right, for the Anglo-
American EMI Publishing Repertoire the situation for content provider remains
difficult. For the right of making available, CELAS is acting not in its own name but
in the name of PRS and GEMA as a representative. If there is a dispute regarding the
ownership of the rights, the content provider would have difficulties to ask for
indemnification as it is unclear who should be addressed. The issue increases as most
of the musical works have so called split copyrights, which means that part of the
works are owned by various rights-holders.

To solve this problem, it should be clarified that the right of making available and the
corresponding reproduction right necessary for one economic process may not be
split and represented by different rights-holders. Therefore, the making available
right should always cover the right of reproduction as far as the right of making
available cannot be used without the right of reproduction. To offer content to users
via online and mobile platforms, the reproduction on the server of the service
provider is a necessary condition for the making available of such content.

Generally speaking, it is fundamental to simplify the IPR clearing regime for the
distribution of digital works on online platforms and align it to the regimes
applicable to all platforms in order to grant technological neutrality.




which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many Member
States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with
regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

ETNO Reflection Document RD403 (2014/02)                                                                  7
Q11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightsholder?
  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of
communication to the public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered
by a copyright exception)

A hyperlink provision facilitates access to a work that has already been published on
a specific website. Linking is in the essence of the Internet and it is impossible to
conceive the functioning of the Internet without links. This should not be understood
as a new publication or as a duplication of a work except if a protection measure has
been bypassed in order to provide the link. As such, ETNO sees no requirement for a
licence in this situation and we note that the recent ECJ ruling in the Svensson6 case
reflects this viewpoint. On the contrary, if the provision of a link were subject to
authorization of rights-holders, the way in which the Internet works today would
simply collapse as it will be impossible to include any link in a web page due to
potential copyright infringement.

Q12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the
screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under
specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightsholder?
  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a
copyright exception)

Web-browsing creates temporary copies that are covered by the exception
established in Article 5 (1) of Directive 2001/29/EC and do not constitute an
infringement of copyright. For example, when viewing film trailers, the streaming
process needs a temporary, ephemeral duplication by buffering in the cache,
however this process is taking place automatically and the copy is also automatically
deleted, without any human intervention, after a certain time. To change this
understanding would mean that those who merely browse the Internet, without
downloading anything, are likely unintentionally to incur a civil liability. As the UK
Supreme Court7 referring the question to the ECJ has already rightly noted, it would
be an unacceptable result to consider millions of ordinary Internet users to be
copyright infringers by merely accessing a web-page containing copyright material.
This should also not be the intention of the European legislator.

Everyday interactions of users with digital technology give rise to multiple
temporary digital reproductions of fragments of content. These are essential to the
functioning of digital technologies, devices, networks, etc. According to the UK
Supreme Court and some academics, requiring permission from a newspaper

licensing agency for such uses would break down the Internet and “would make
infringers of many millions of ordinary users of the internet across the EU”.

Q16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system [a registration system
at EU level to help in the identification and licensing of works and other subject
matter]?

[Open question]
A content registration system would lead to legal certainty for digital content
distributors. Much more simplicity and less administrative costs would be a positive
result.


Q17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
Possible disadvantages would include the costs of such a sophisticated system. Who
has to bear such costs? Also, procedural issues, such as jurisdiction and/or dispute
resolution systems, should be considered as well as the interplay with collecting
societies and the legal status of, and supervision on, their activities


Q19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in
the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
ownership and permissions databases?
[Open question]

In consideration of the existence of many different national and/or private
databases, in general ETNO believes that the creation of a global repertoire would
facilitate the identification of works and their related rights, with positive
consequences for the acquisition process of rights.

Q21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


Cross border Services (e.g. Cloud Storages) demand a harmonised pan-European
legal framework. This applies from a content licensing perspective as well as from a
consumer perspective.

It is important that the same legal framework exists in order to ensure that a service,
which is legal in one Member State can also be offered in another Member State. For
all providers of cross border services, the same legal and competitive environment
has to be established.

Example: According to Article 5, Section II b of the Directive 2001/29/EC, natural
persons have the right to make reproductions of works on any media for private use
and for ends that are neither directly nor indirectly commercial on condition that the
rights-holder receives fair compensation and under the precondition that no copy


ETNO Reflection Document RD403 (2014/02)                                            9
protection measures have been removed or altered. This limitation and exception is
not mandatory for Member States. The German legislator implemented this
limitation into German law (Section 53 of the German Copyright Act). Therefore, in
Germany the reproduction of works, e.g. by transferring a music file from a CD on a
Computer or on online cloud storages by an end user for private use is possible
without the consent of the rights-holder. In the United Kingdom Article 5, Section II
b of the Directive has not been implemented into national law. A comparable
copyright exception does not exist with the consequence that end-users are not
allowed to make copies even for their own and immediate family’s use on different
media without the consent of the rights-holder. This may lead to the situation where
a provider of an online storage service could liable for copyright infringement in the
UK under the Copyright, Designs and Patent Act 1988 whereas the same service and
the same provider would not infringe any copyright in a Member State, where
Article 5, Section II b of the Directive 2001/29/EC has been implemented into
national law, e.g. in Germany. This makes it difficult to offer a cross-border online
storage service.

In some other Member States e.g. Belgium, there is no legal certainty that the private
copy exception covers copies made and stored out of the customer’s premises and
this even if all other legal criteria are met. This uncertainty hinders the development
of new services.

In Italy, the decree of the Ministry of Culture on the determination of the private
copy levy, adopted in 2009, is currently under revision (the decree was also
challenged before the administrative court following an appeal presented by several
operators). In this framework, the society for authors and publishers recently
presented a proposal to update the tariffs, with the aim of increasing the levies
applied to those devices that are most marketed such as smartphones, tablets, etc.
and to decrease the ones applied to the devices that are registering a sales decrease
on the market. In particular, it proposes to increase the level of tariffs and to extend
its application to products that should be excluded due to their specific
characteristics (some devices are not used for reproduction purposes), or because the
private copy levy is already managed through DRMs and/or other technological
protection measures. Moreover, the proposed tariffs refer to a hypothetical
“European average”, whose level seems not to be consistent with the figures
available. Concerns have also been raised on the methodological side, since the
determination of the levy is left to a consultative committee and a technical
commission, where the ICT industry, differently from the right-holders and the
collecting societies sector, is not represented. This means there is no full
representation of all the stakeholders and interests involved and risks to produce an
unbalanced outcome. An EU harmonised procedure and homogeneous criteria is
needed, so as to determine a consistent and harmonized level of tariffs, levied on the
same products, throughout the EU.

It would therefore be important, in those countries where the private copy regime is
applied, to grant a full harmonisation of the applicable regime, specifically in relation
to the criteria for the determination of the tariffs, the fair compensation principle, the
double compensation, etc. Moreover, ETNO believes that revenue from private copy
levies should be used to develop new business models.

   Q24. Is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU
   regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
   YES – Please explain why



See Question 21. We should avoid a fragmentation of the legal framework. In
addition, the door should be kept open for future exceptions that may be necessary
as technology develops.




Q26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience,
constitute a problem?
 YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
 NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
 NO OPINION
The realisation of a true single market is hampered by the existence, in Member
States, of different regimes for limitations and exceptions, rendering it almost
impossible for distributors to have a full knowledge of the legislation in place and
therefore whether a content/product can be legitimately distributed in a country and
under which conditions. An increased harmonisation of the limitations and
exceptions throughout Europe would be necessary, although taking into account
national specificities. It should be done taking into account the need not to hamper
the development of innovative services and the need to facilitate, in the digital age,
the widest possible diffusion of digital works for the benefit of consumers. The
private copy levy regime is one of the most evident examples of fragmentation: not
only is this exception is not provided for by all Member States (eg in UK it does not
exist under current legislation), but also the conditions for its application vary
significantly (for example the requirement for its application, the devices targeted by
the rule and the fair compensation amount).       It would therefore be important, in
those countries where the private copy regime is applied, to grant a full
harmonisation of the applicable regime, specifically in relation to the criteria for the
determination of the tariffs, the fair compensation principle, the double
compensation, etc.


   Q27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level
   were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation”
   be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays
   whom, where?)
   [Open question]




ETNO Reflection Document RD403 (2014/02)                                             11
ETNO recognizes the importance for rights-holders to be compensated for their
works and believes that the concept of ‘fair compensation’ should be addressed at
EU level. A uniform approach is necessary to allow for the efficient implementation
of the Copyright Directive in the age of cloud computing. As possible solution is
rights clearance and payment in the Member State where the service is operated
under the precondition that a) a harmonized appropriate tariff for all the other
Member States exist and b) the possibility exists to clear the rights for all territories.
In addition, double payment should be avoided.

Q58. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced
problems when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to
disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when
users publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other
subject-matter through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting
from the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to
disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?
    YES – Please explain by giving examples
A differentiation must be made amongst two cases: 1. the case of a private user that
does a mash-up of works of unknown owners and diffuses them through online
services, and 2. the case where the owner of a mashed-up work is known and its
work is used for the development of different services.
In the first case, when a service providers allows its clients to upload a specific
content, for instance through a chat or a community, be the content his/her own
content or that of a unknown third party content subsequently re-used, the provider
cannot be considered liable for this content according to the basic principles of the e-
Commerce Directive, which recognise that the providers cannot have any visibility
nor knowledge (and therefore no responsibility) over the content uploaded by its
clients. In these cases, the client is usually required to view and accept the terms and
conditions of the service provider, assuming all responsibility for the content
uploaded.
In the second case, the rights to distribute the content must be exercised only when
the rights-holder has granted specific authorisation. This can have, de facto,
significant negative effects on the development of innovative services by
professionals.
ETNO asks the European Commission to consider the difference between a private
and non-commercial usage and a commercial usage of user-generated content.
Professional commercial usage (such as TV spots including music etc.) must be fully
licensed including adaptation rights et al.


Q64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application
of the private copying and reprography exceptions8 in the digital environment?
YES – Please explain

Diverging national systems target different products and apply different tariffs. This
results in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market.
At the same time, some Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate
application of private copy levies to transactions irrespective of the person to whom
the product is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member
States have ex-ante exemption and/or ex-post reimbursement schemes which could
remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments.

The scope, application and level of copyright levies continue to increase rapidly and
vary substantially between Member States. More in particular, increases of the fair
compensation amount for products such as smartphones, tablets and computers raise
questions of proportionality and efficiency, in consideration of the severe negative
effects they may have on the market and on consumers at a time when, instead,
Member States should be fostering Internet usage.
Industry faces a fragmented market with substantial legal and financial uncertainties.
An obligation for Member States to file with the Commission all their copyright
levies and the publication by the Commission of exhaustive up-to-date data would
greatly increase industry visibility and reduce legal uncertainty.

Clarification on the scope is also needed regarding the exclusion of illegal copies,
user-generated-content, professional use, public domain, and all other elements
which should not fall within the scope of the exception.

Regarding compensation for acts of private copying, it has to be unambiguously
confirmed that compensation for private copying is exclusively targeted to private
copy (and must not be extended to professional use) and is based on harm and
therefore should only exist if there is a proven substantial harm to right holders. Also
the term “harm” must be more precisely defined. Similarly, it should be clarified that
the levy should not be requested when devices and equipment are used for the
private copying of content that has already legally bought by the user/consumer. In
this case, the copyrights have been already paid for by the distributor/audio-visual
service provider according to specific distribution agreements. Should a levy be
imposed, a double payment of the same content would occur, creating an additional
and unreasonable burden on one industry.

In the absence of such clarifications on the scope and the application of the exception,
the levy system is clearly out of control as historic definitions allow unlimited claims
from collecting societies leading to an unreasonable and unjustified accumulation of
levies for consumers and industry.

Finally as noted by Towse: ”…copyright levy… has been almost universally opposed by
economists on the grounds that its remuneration to creators bears no resemblance to the
market value of the works and therefore could not act as a valid incentive to creators”.9 This
observation points to a failure or a broken concept in the current copyright system
that fails to deliver on key policy objectives. Instead of allowing rights-holders to
stimulate investment in intellectual property, the current application of private copy

levies risks introducing a narrow privilege and economic support for a specific
industry.




     Q65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context
     of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the
     rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?10
     NO – Please explain

No. In the case where a service has been licensed by rights-holders, ETNO believes
that imposing private copy levies would hinder development of the digital
distribution economy, even more so if the harm is minimal.



Q66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services
(e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies
on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business
models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
The extension of the current levy system – which was conceived within the analogue
world - to the online environment needs to be properly assessed, in order not to
hamper the development of innovative technologies and services. The Vitorino
report clearly indicates that attempts to broaden the interpretation of the private
copying exception are not only to the detriment of rights-holders and legal offers
based on license agreements, but are also legally questionable and should not be
supported.

Cloud computing allows easier access to digital content for consumers and provides
artists with new distribution models. In the digital era, consumers need to be able to
access digital content from several connected devices at all times and from anywhere.
European consumers and Internet users would be the first victims of the imposition
of levies on cloud services since prices would most certainly raise because of levies.
Also, companies of all sizes, which are increasingly using cloud services, could also
face this consequence.

One of the main advantages of cloud services is their global nature; therefore
imposing territorial/national levy systems on global services is unfeasible, especially
considering the principles of the Single Market. Imposing levies on cloud services
would also have negative impact on European cloud service providers, as the
obligation to pay levies added to new administrative burden would significantly
limit their competitiveness in the global market. The negative impact on new
business models would be immediate, as levies would raise prices and thus limit the
attractiveness, competitiveness and future development of business models based on
new technologies.

  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

ETNO Reflection Document RD403 (2014/02)                                                                 14
Moreover in the digital world, often rights-holders receive compensation for licensed
content including subsequent copies in the framework of licensing contracts between
rights-holders and users. In these cases, applying the copyright levy system to cloud
services would result in an unjustified triple payment by consumers (for the licensed
content, for the connected device, and for the cloud service).

It should also be noted that private copying levies are currently applied to devices
which contain a storage capacity, as it was assumed that since devices with a storage
capacity can be used to copy protected content they should all be subject to levies. In
the case of access-based cloud services, storage capacity in the device is not needed
and applying levies on them is thus incorrect.


     Q67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for
     products subject to levies?11
     YES – Please explain



Visibility of the levy in the invoice of those products that are subject to levies would
bring increased transparency and awareness among customers even if this could also
increase the risk of “copyright levies shopping” between Member States. ETNO
believes that the burden of providing information should be borne by those who
benefit from the revenues of the levies. In case the European Commission decides
otherwise, we believe that proportionality requires that the costs are borne by rights-
holders. Distributors should not have to pay copyright levies and bear the financial
burden of informing end-users.

Q71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]


ETNO recommends keeping the liability with manufacturers and/or importers
because manufacturers market shares are more concentrated and consistent across
Member States than relevant retail market shares therefore better equipped to come
up with an efficient common pan-European technical solution to collect levies. In
addition, keeping liability with manufacturers/importers is also supported by
collecting societies12 and at the same time not advocated by any leading European
ICT companies.

A specific problem under German law is the system under which the respective
tariffs are determined. Under the current system, it can take years before a certain
tariff is finally fixed. Therefore, a fixed process for tariffs which determines the scope
of application and precise amounts would lead to more clarity.

As mentioned earlier, in Italy the decree of the Ministry of Culture on the
determination of the private copy levy, adopted in 2009, is currently under revision
(the decree was also challenged before the administrative court following an appeal
presented by several operators). In this framework, the society for authors and
publishers recently presented a proposal to update the tariffs, with the aim of
increasing the levies applied to those devices that are most marketed such as
smartphones, tablets, etc. and to decrease the ones applied to the devices that are
registering a sales decrease on the market. In particular, it proposes to increase the
level of tariffs and to extend its application to products that should be excluded due
to their specific characteristics (some devices are not used for reproduction
purposes), or because the private copy levy is already managed through DRMs
and/or other technological protection measures. Moreover, the proposed tariffs
refer to a hypothetical “European average”, whose level seems not to be consistent
with the figures available. Concerns have also been raised on the methodological
side, since the determination of the levy is left to a consultative committee and a
technical commission, where the ICT industry, differently from the right-holders and
the collecting societies sector, is not represented. This means there is no full
representation of all the stakeholders and interests involved and risks to produce an
unbalanced outcome. An EU harmonised procedure and homogeneous criteria is
needed, so as to determine a consistent and harmonised level of tariffs, levied on the
same products, throughout the EU.


Q75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
     NO – Please explain
The current civil enforcement framework at European level remains sound and is
based on principles that are still relevant today as confirmed by the recent European
Court of Justice Decisions. The European Court of Justice has given important and
useful indications in two well-known cases (Promusicae13 and Tele214), asking
Member States and their respective authorities to take measures that, while balancing
both rights, should respect the principle of proportionality. The European Court of
Justice Decisions imply also that Internet service providers cannot assume the
responsibility of balancing rights and becoming controllers of the Internet. As a
consequence, ETNO believes that the enforcement framework, completed by the ECJ
ruling, achieves the right balance between copyright and the right to privacy and
protection of personal data.

The balance with fundamental rights should include rights such as the presumption
of innocence, right to a fair trial and the confidentiality of communications. In
addition and since the SABAM case15, the European Court of Justice has also
considered the right to conduct business as a fundamental right that should be taken
into consideration during the overall balancing process. The Advocate General

Villalon in his opinions delivered with regard to cases Case C-70/10 and C-314/12
has touched on a further important element, which is a necessary concrete legal basis
in case the enforcement measure is restricting fundamental rights. And in a recent
judgment in Germany (21.11.2013 OLG Hamburg 5 U 68/10), it was confirmed that
any measure imposing blocking or filtering mechanisms on an access provider in
Germany must be based on a law defining in detail how the access to the infringing
content should be impeded.



Q76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for
sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers,
advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in
inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what
measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]


ETNO would like to highlight that Internet intermediaries have always worked in
collaboration with judicial authorities, who play a crucial role in ensuring citizens
and businesses the right to a fair trial. Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights
should not be seen as the sole solution against copyright infringement - increasing
the availability and affordability of the legal content offer is also key.

ETNO believes that efficient copyright enforcement in the digital industry needs an
approach involving all Internet players in the value chain. The current approach,
which is mainly focused on Internet service providers working in collaboration with
judicial authorities has a limited reach.


Q80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
The current enforcement system, under the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement
Directive (IPRED), has played and continues to play a crucial role in providing
rights-holders with a high level of intellectual property right protection. This legal
text is based upon principles that remain valid today and that should be maintained.
Any future eventual revision should be coherent with the current intermediary
liability regime. In addition, any reinforcement of the contribution of intermediaries
in the fight against illegal file sharing must remain compliant with the right to a
presumption of innocence, the right to a fair trial, the right to privacy and the right to
the confidentiality of communications.

The enforcement of intellectual property rights should not be seen as the sole
solution. A more holistic view is necessary, focusing on how to increase offers and
the consumption of legal content. Enforcement should not become a tool to protect
businesses from competition and allow players to keep outdated business models
limiting the potential that new technologies may have. The policy debate should also
be grounded on reliable and objective data about the cost/benefit of copyright
enforcement within legal proceedings.

As mentioned earlier, ETNO believes that a rethinking of the release windows
mechanisms is necessary. In a recent study published by Spotify, one of the questions
was examining the impact of holdout strategies on sales and illegal torrent volumes.
The result was that “artists who delayed their release on Spotify suffered higher levels of
piracy than those who did not”. (Spotify report: Adventures in the Netherlands: Spotify,
Piracy and the new Dutch experience). The availability of the most recent content
from legal sources online would therefore be a very effective tool to reduce copyright
infringements.
