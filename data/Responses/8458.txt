     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
 YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)

2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
  YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright or
to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,

5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
 YES – Please explain by giving examples
Yes. However, the reasons are not copyright-related. For example, (i) some Member States
have more protective rules about individuals’ privacy than others, with the result that certain
otherwise acceptable content is unsuitable for use in those countries; (ii) some Member States
have particular provisions restricting certain subject matter (e.g. concerning German Third
Reich-related content and insignia) which therefore cannot be distributed in those countries.

the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
 YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain
In our own field, no. FOCAL’s members are commercial organisations, which regularly
exploit their audiovisual content throughout the EU and the world by commercial licence
without cross-border difficulties.


We consider that some proposed new measures (particularly in the UK) will potentially
reduce the level of protection for right holders significantly – in particular, widening of
copyright exceptions without taking account of relevant internationally established industry
norms, and extending collective licensing.


We are aware of other fields such as online music where we understand that collective
arrangements hinder cross-border availability of content services, but the Commission’s
attempts to increase the cross-border availability of content services in that field within the
EU have been ongoing for a considerable time.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other


16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is

                                                                                                           10
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
 YES
  NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)
We believe that the making available right in cross-border situations (including the latest
CJEU rulings e.g. “the new public” issue raised in “FAPL” and “TV Catchup”) could


referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

                                                                                                               11
helpfully be clarified, just as a similar issue was clarified in relation to satellite transmission
(by Council Directive 93/83/EEC).
Adoption of that Directive’s country of origin approach would provide greatest legal and thus
commercial certainty, which in our largely international business we would welcome –
especially if the principle could be introduced even more widely than the EU.
Notable judgments of national courts, within and beyond the EU, have however tended to
adopt the “communication” principle, usually to justify jurisdiction of a national court over
extra-territorial acts. From a commercial perspective, this is the least practical solution
because although it may provide a convenient “quick fix” for a particular high profile
infringement claim, it results in the greatest degree of ongoing uncertainty for the millions of
legitimate day-to-day cross-border commercial transactions.
As a general principle, we would favour the country of origin principle over the “target”
principle adopted in some CJEU judgments, which we believe are particular to their facts and
circumstances, and not typical of business-to-business commerce in the audiovisual field.

9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
 YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
Yes, probably – to the extent that the clarification removed current ambiguities of where an
act of making available occurs.
In practice, though, as national courts become more willing to assume extra-territorial
jurisdiction, and in view of the degree of copyright law convergence (including enforcement)
already attained within the EU, this is not a problem in our industry within the EU.
(Differences between copyright and other laws as between the EU in general and the USA do
give rise to significant issues - but that is beyond the scope of this consultation document.)
Specifically in relation to the making available right, though, difficulties of enforcement can
easily be overstated, or are more theoretical than real, because the reproduction right is also
usually involved in the territories where commercially relevant copyright acts take place, and
within the EU there are no territorial and therefore jurisdictional difficulties with that (though
there can of course be issues elsewhere, e.g. Chan Nai Ming v HKSAR Hong Kong Court of
Final Appeal 2008).

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
 YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO
No. In our field, all the rights are in the hands of right owners, who regularly license online
exploitation EU- and world-wide without difficulty.
We are aware of problems in some spheres where rights are collectively administered, and for
historic reasons the two rights are in different hands. However, collective administration of
rights in the audiovisual field is used only is very limited situations, where in any event this
issue does not arise.

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?

 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
In general, our industry’s commercial licences include terms governing whether and the
extent to which and the circumstances in which the licensee can make the licensed material
available online. The licensee usually pays an appropriate licence fee, in determining which
the number of visits to a web page (for example) can be taken into account if relevant.
In many circumstances provision of a hyperlink may form part of the licensed process.
However, further unauthorised making available of the content (including to a “new public”)
must be subject to authorisation of the right holder – including providing access to the content
by providing a hyperlink (see our answer to 8 above).
As to temporary copying, temporary copies which fall within a licensed use should not be
seen as having further economic significance (i.e. no extra fee should be payable), but
temporary copying (including temporary copying during browsing) which falls outside the
licensed use should not fall within the temporary copying exception, and should be subject to
the right holder’s consent.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
We consider that the right holders’ consent must be obtained for including a protected work or
other subject matter in a web page and making it available to viewers. This consent may be
subject to various provisions, for example it may be time limited, or restricted to a specific
page, or a specific URL, or specific territories (e.g. by geoblocking), and the licensee may for
example agree not to permit downloading. In other words, we see copying for uploading,
making available via the Internet, and also copying for viewing, as the responsibility of the
licensee (as concerns the licensing of content for the web page).

                                                                                             14
Provided the web-page is made available within the licensed parameters, we believe that
viewing of the web page (including the temporary copies involved) should not require the
right owner’s licence. It does not seem practical, taking into consideration the way that the
web is used today, to require a person browsing the web to get a right owner’s consent before
opening and browsing a publicly available web page.
Of course, this does not apply to purchasing content on the web, where the web site
specifically provides the means for users to buy protected works or other subject matter, e.g.
by downloading or watching a streamed movie, or to pages which require payment to access.
But in these cases, too, a commercial licence from the right owners should allow inclusion of
their content in the service, and again copying (including temporary copying) which falls
within the service should benefit from the temporary copying exception; and copying which
doesn’t should not (and neither should communication to a “new public”).

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]


Commercial audiovisual “sales” (i.e. licensing) are made subject to commercial terms which
include terms governing distribution.
Rights (e.g. of ownership) in the physical medium (e.g. reels, tapes, other digital devices) are
not the same as the intellectual property rights in their contents.
It is a commonplace that purchase of a physical medium (e.g. original letters written by
Princess Diana, a reel of film containing a Beatles concert) does not necessarily entail
acquisition of the copyright in the contents. (There are of course special circumstances where
the copyright may follow the physical support, e.g. under a will unless the testator specified
the contrary.)
Any legal framework which alters this dichotomy will be severely disruptive to our business
which is largely international, especially as the status quo would undoubtedly continue
outside the EU, including in the USA.
Any legal framework which alters or restricts the right holder’s right to deal with (license,
“sell”) her intellectual property rights would similarly disrupt our business, for the same
reasons. Rights are often granted (under licence, or by transfer) for agreed limited periods, in
agreed specified territories, for use in agreed specific circumstances, etc. Specifically, they
may be non-transferrable by the recipient. A provision enabling the licensee or transferee to
“resell” such rights would totally disrupt current commercial practice. This would be
particularly serious in the international context – as stated above, rights are often exploited on
a worldwide basis, and a different arrangement imposed by law within the EU only would
make this unmanageable and would be extraordinarily disruptive. Even if a new compulsory
norm were introduced throughout the EU, we would anticipate a significant flight of business
to outside the EU (business flight has already taken place from the UK, in response to some
proposals).

C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not

   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.

                                                                                                     16
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
 YES
A registration system is already being created at OHIM for orphan works. Perhaps this could
be gradually extended, if possible in cooperation and interlinked with the UK’s developing
Copyright Hub and any other national developments, within and beyond the EU.
 NO
 NO OPINION


16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
More, centralised rights information can only be helpful, and would hopefully reduce
transaction costs in some circumstances.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
At least in the audiovisual field there are formidable obstacles to creating total uniformity
(including of universal identifiers and contract terms). This does not mean that useful systems
cannot be developed, but it must be recognised that such systems cannot in the foreseeable
future be prescriptive or comprehensive. Therefore, it would be important that the advisory
nature of such systems was clearly recognised and publicised.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
Disincentives have been discussed, at least in the UK - for example, that certain remedies
would only be available in respect of registered rights. We oppose such proposals, believing
that they would breach international treaty obligations. Further, in the audiovisual field the
lack of a single system of unique identifiers for the foreseeable future would mean that any
legally awarded remedies, relying on registration, could well be based on incomplete or
inaccurate information.


30
  On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             17
We cannot envisage any practical incentives which could legitimately be offered to right
holders to register, other than the incentives of convenience, cost reduction, etc. which would
be inherent in participating in a practical, effective, un-bureaucratic and cost effective system.
The system itself should be the incentive.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
The EC already makes a considerable and apparently increasing amount of funding available
for organisations engaged in this task. It seems unlikely that creation of (for example) a new
department within the EC to carry out this task “in-house” would add anything other than
levels of bureaucracy. On the other hand, it would be job creation for those employed.
Our fear would be that the result would require additional expenditure of time or money by
the businesses concerned in operating within the systems thus created, which would not be
compensated by improved business efficiency and profits. This would increase the imbalance
between the costs of doing business within and outside the EU.

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
 YES – Please explain
We do not believe they should be shorter. Digitisation of analogue content accounts for a
large amount of investment in our industry sector. It is difficult to earn the investment back.
(We are not referring to Member State- or EC- funded or subsidised digitisation projects, but
to the self-supporting commercial sector.) Decreased copyright terms would make it more
difficult to earn back the investment, leading to fewer self-supporting digitisation projects
within the EU, leaving the task to public funding, which in the current climate is decreasing
within the Member States. Self-funding commercial projects would be fewer, and many
would migrate to the USA, Australia and other countries which maintained the current terms
of copyright. (Already other copyright law proposals, notably the UK’s “loosening” of
copyright exceptions, are having these effects: in those cases, although the term of protection
remains unchanged, more copyright-protected material can be used without the right holder’s
licence, having a similar effect on the potential to recoup investment.)

 III.          Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract




35
     Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.

                                                                                                                 19
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory

   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            20

Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain
No. Even despite the philosophically different basis of copyright and droit d’auteur within the
EU, and the differences of detailed wording between the Member States’ copyright statutes, in
commercial practice the differences are too slight to make any impact on intra-Community
trade.
In practical conduct of business, commercially significant differences arise between the US
system of fair use and the European system of copyright exceptions as a whole – a “trans-
Atlantic divide” – but that is beyond the scope of this consultation.

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain
No. Our answer is as for 21. The practical business reality is that the differences between the
Member States’ exceptions regimes are too slight to have any significant commercial impact.
This could change if the UK goes ahead and introduces its current proposals, depending on
how widely some of the widely-drafted proposals (such as quotation and parody) will be
interpreted.
We also believe that some exceptionally risk-averse non-commercial organisations
(sometimes public bodies such as museums and state archives) are unduly cautious and over-
restrictive in their approach to this issue, encouraged (in the case of the UK) for policy
reasons. This tends to exaggerate any possible need to harmonise exceptions further.

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]


No. Our answer is as for 22. The practical business reality is that the differences between the
Member States’ exceptions regimes are too slight to have any significant commercial impact.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
 YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain why
No. As we have explained in 21, 22 and 23 there is a de facto commercially functional level
of harmonisation already. Departures from this level have the potential to disrupt intra-
Community trade. The best example must be the issues that arise between US fair use and the
EU exceptions regimes, which can mean that audiovisual productions which can be exploited
legitimately in the USA cannot be exploited in the EU without obtaining further consents
from right holders; and conversely productions which are made in the EU premised on right
holders’ consents may fall outside agreed licence terms in the USA. (A similar issue can arise
from moral rights – though of course these cannot be licensed as such.) It would be
regrettable if any significant differences were allowed to arise within the Single Market. As
stated in 22, some current UK proposals risk producing this effect.

 NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
National courts with the overarching jurisdiction of the CJEU seems the best practical
arrangement. The idea of Member States’ national courts ceding their jurisdictions seems
improbable, not least in the current economic situation within the EU.

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
It seems impractical for national exceptions to have cross-border effect.
In the first instance, why only exceptions? What rationale can there be for just exceptions to
have cross-border effect? Surely all national copyright provisions would have to have cross-
border effect. The effect of this would be indescribably chaotic in a legal sense, in that it
would practically speaking be necessary to determine the country of origin of every work, and
apply the relevant country’s laws. In the case of co-productions between several countries
where the co-produced work is indivisible, this would lead to enormously complex situations,
legally speaking. Currently simple contracts would become enormously complicated, and
ordinary creative businesses which was well manage their contractual relations would
undoubtedly lack the expertise needed to contract under such a legal regime. To impose such
legal complexities on what is currently a well-functioning market seems unthinkable. For
example, above we have referred to issues raised by US fair use/EU copyright exceptions.
Imagine businesses trying to take into account fair use for US-origin works and the EU
regimes for EU national works on a daily basis, and individual EU national courts and the
CJEU applying fair use to US-origin works and the EU regimes to EU national works
exploited in a single Member State - and some kind of mixture of the two in the case of co-
productions.
If cross-border effect were legislated for specific copyright exceptions (such as those which
have associated fair compensation), that would soon be applied by the CJEU and national
courts in other areas of copyright, so a patchwork of areas of cross-border effect and of no
cross-border effect would begin to develop, giving rise to increasing legal uncertainty within
the EU. (It will be interesting to see how long the lex in Case C-128/11 remains specialis.)
Commercially this is completely unnecessary: our industry trades intra- and extra-Community
without difficulty, on the basis of the current national copyright regimes and jurisdictions.
Specifically concerning fair compensation at a practical level, this is usually handled by
national CMOs, which have reciprocal agreements with other CMOs. It seems that some do

                                                                                           23
and some don’t account to their sister CMOs in various circumstances. This particular issue
should therefore be addressed (along with the other current CMO issues) specifically as a
CMO matter, rather than by introducing difficult and far-reaching new principles into
copyright law, which will have many unforeseen consequences. Further, the legal
jurisdictional issues raised by the idea that an exception (and concomitant payment) provided
under (say) German statute should be directly enforceable in (say) Spain is a step which we
do not believe would be welcomed by all EU Member States’ governments at the present
time.

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
 YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

 NO
Not generally.
Problems are only caused when such institutions wish to rely on copyright exceptions (or
favourable e.g. state funding provisions) to compete unfairly with commercial exploitation, at
the expense of legitimate right holders. The problem generally arises because such
institutions are increasingly required to “commercialise” their activities, often to make up for
decreased taxpayer funding. However, to the extent that they wish to function commercially,
they should do so on a regular commercial basis (e.g. paying appropriate licence fees for
commercial exploitation – which fees must therefore simply be taken into account when
budgeting commercial projects). It is not the role of the commercial sector to subsidise such
institutions in default of the taxpayer, except when that role is (not infrequently) voluntarily
assumed.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the

                                                                                             25
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?

[Open question]

Our members operate primarily business-to-business. However, off-premises use of their
content takes place in educational and museum contexts, where it is effectively managed by
licence.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
 YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved

 NO – Please explain

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             28
 NO OPINION


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
 YES – Please explain
Out of commerce arrangements can be appropriate for primarily non-commercial situations,
e.g. making an out-of-commerce book available to a digital library readership.
Our members’ rights are commercially licensed, and this is the basis of their worldwide
commercial business. Their content can be embedded in, for example, broadcasters’ archives.
These rights have been commercially licensed, and if necessary licences can be renewed or
extended by the licensees, e.g. broadcasters. Many out-of-commerce arrangements currently
being proposed are not appropriate for our members’ commercial rights.
We are aware of pressure to make content available at any cost – or rather, at no or minimum
cost – simply because it is there and can be digitised. We are also aware of many proposals to
which are aimed at circumventing the need to license rights (and often pay for them). This
contrasts with the principle that copyright (or a related right) is a property right. The
dichotomy between these two ideas is particularly acute concerning proposals which would
permit commercial exploitation of “out of commerce” works without the right holder’s
licence (as distinct from orphan works). We support non-commercial and commercial (i.e.
beyond Directive 2012/28/EU) solutions for orphan works. However, our international
membership does not support any arrangements allowing commercial use of protected works
which the right holders may for a variety of legitimate reasons not wish to exploit. This is
tantamount to compulsory licensing, which we believe should only be allowed in the specific
situations permitted under the Berne Convention.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

fees, rather than in the educational sector.

educational use in question) which is done commercially and provided to the users under
licence.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
 YES – Please explain
In the audiovisual sector data mining is currently carried out under licence. Current UK
proposals (to allow any party which has legitimate access to a database for another purpose to
carry out data mining without the right holder’s consent, and that the parties cannot agree
otherwise by contract) will cause withdrawal of services which are commercially valuable to
the users as well as to the providers (i.e. where users currently have licensed access to
databases), and removal of some archives outside the UK. The issue is not so much of
licensors wanting to charge fees for the activity, as of technical capacity and security. There
is no particular cross-border issue (as explained elsewhere, licences – and licensed access to
databases – is regularly provided on a pan-EU and more frequently worldwide basis) – except
that databases will move not merely outside the UK but outside the EU if comparable
provisions are introduced throughout the EU.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?


53
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

 IV.           Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by

55
     Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                              37
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
 YES – Please explain
Current UK Government draft proposals and accompanying policy statements suggests that
the application of remuneration needs clarification at the EU level.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.

devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

 NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
  YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
Commercial licensing (and other appropriate contracts)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
 YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain why
The UK arrangement (current proposals to exclude certain prohibitions) will produce a
situation of great commercial uncertainty. It is not clear how or to what extent existing
contracts will be affected, unenforceable or ineffective – including contracts entered into and
relying on which large investments have been made, and which may now be undermined or
the investments unrecoupable. The effect on future contracts is likely to drive the business
out of the country. To replicate the problem at EU level will have a proportionately greater
effect.
It must be remembered that many countries outside the EU which are otherwise favourable to
audiovisual production and business generally will not be introducing this kind of uncertainty
into their copyright laws.

 VI.       Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has



64
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.

                                                                                                      41
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?

   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.

   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 YES and
 NO


No. As explained above, for commercial purposes the level of EU copyright harmonisation is
satisfactory and commercially functional, and does not produce appreciable commercial
barriers within the Single Market. (This statement may not be true of some aspects of
collective licensing especially in the online environment, but this is not an audiovisual issue.)
 Harmonisation at this level would require enormous efforts and huge expenditure of time and
money – when one considers the efforts that have gone into trying to harmonise just the
exceptions regime even thus far. Advantages if any within the EU would be minimal, and it
must be remembered that in any case the rest of the world would remain unharmonised.


Yes. On the other hand, having regard to the European Commission’s overarching imperative
towards an ever-closer political Union rather than to the commercial single market-related
considerations described above, copyright would be attractive subject matter with which to
introduce a single pan-EU title, as copyright law has relatively low profile amongst the
general public than subject matter which has a higher general public profile, such as national
criminal justice. One can therefore suppose that attempted introduction of a single EU
copyright title, even if difficult, would at least encounter less general public opposition than
attempted introduction of, say, a single EU criminal justice code.
To the extent that the process would be complicated and long, it could contribute to
significant and stable employment within the Commission; and within the EU in the sector

                                                                                              43
generally, as we have noticed the large and increasing expenditure by the industry on rights
and associated lobbying of Member State governments, the Commission and European
Parliamentarians.

79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

We think this would be a very long term project.
