                            Cable Europe’s Response to the Public Consultation
                            on the Review of the EU Copyright Rules

                            Identity:

                            European Cable Communications Association (Cable Europe)

                         II.         RIGHTS AND THE FUNCTIONING OF THE SINGLE MARKET



                            A.       Why is it not possible to access many online content services
                                     from anywhere in Europe?


                            1.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced
                            problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member State
                            other than the one in which you live?




                            2.   [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
                            when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


                            YES.

                            Market developments, driven by the emergence of new devices and changes in
                            customer habits, have caused subscribers to want to access the content distributed

                                                                                                                                     1
                            by their cable operator on multiple devices at any time and regardless of their
                            location. In fact, subscribers want the channels and other content (e.g. VoD
                            services) offered by their cable operator to be “portable” anywhere in the home, in
                            the country, in Europe and beyond.

                            Cable operators have launched new services to meet such customer demand, e.g.
                            services enabling cable subscribers to watch their content on computers, tablets
                            and/or smart phones.

                            The members of Cable Europe are however experiencing difficulties to obtain the
                            necessary rights for these services. In particular, they are facing significant
                            difficulties to obtain the “out- of- home” rights needed to enable their subscribers
                            to access their content when outside of their home, be it in their country of origin
                            or abroad. These difficulties range from refusals to grant the necessary rights to
                            abuses of dominant positions of collective management organizations (“CMOs”) –
                            which unfortunately tend to request unreasonable and unjustified license tariffs –
                            as well as to the burden caused by the fragmentation of rights across national
                            boundaries and unreasonable requests for remuneration for each additional type of
                            device or location. They constitute a significant barrier to innovation in distribution
                            technologies.

                            Amendments to the current legal framework should address these issues in order
                            to promote an innovative and efficient market for content services within and
                            across national borders, taking into account technology neutrality and portability.

                            Whilst there is an increasing demand from customers to be able to access content
                            provided by cable operators across borders, collective management organizations
                            (CMOs) almost exclusively represent the interests of rights holders at a national
                            level and cannot or will not offer multi-territorial licenses. For example, members
                            of Cable Europe have been confronted with CMOs who refuse to allow foreign
                            broadcasters to offer their channels ‘all rights included’ to cable operators, but
                            rather insist on only dealing with the cable operators in their own country. CMOs
                            even obstruct the clearance of online rights within member states by using their
                            dominant positions to request unreasonable and unjustified license tariffs.

                            The clearing of rights is therefore in many cases characterized by a high degree of
                            inefficiency and a lack of transparency, causing cable operators to incur important
                            transaction and opportunity costs. Since copyrights licensed to cable operators are
                            often geographically restricted and clearing the rights for different or all Member
                            States is burdensome, content provided by cable operators to their subscribers will
                            often not be accessible abroad.


                            3.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management
                            organization:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences?
                            Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and provide
                            examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content
                            concerned.

                                                                                                                                     2
                            4.    If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the
                            questions above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


                            While questions 1 and 2 focus on problems faced when accessing or providing
                            online services, Cable Europe wishes to stress that EU regulation should not be
                            limited to targeting these services. Offline and digital services are indeed in
                            constant expansion, and the business models of the various operators are
                            converging. Offline and digital service should thus also be included when measures
                            are taken at the EU level.

                            Cable Europe is of the opinion that an improved, more effective, more
                            efficient, more competitive and more consistent transparent, technology
                            neutral rights management and clearance system for copyrighted works
                            across Europe is needed. The proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights
                            Management is a step in the right direction but further improvements are required.
                            It should be possible to clear the rights needed to distribute content on normal,
                            commercially viable conditions and once the rights have been cleared and the
                            subscribers of the distribution platforms are known, these customers should be
                            granted a portability right. Subscribers of a cable operator should indeed be able
                            to benefit from their subscription anywhere and on any screen or device of their
                            choice, regardless of their location.

                            Cable Europe encourages the adoption of measures at the EU level that tackle
                            these issues. However, we would like to stress that policy makers should not pick
                            winners in a given market. The regulatory framework should therefore have the
                            same operational and cost impact irrespective of the exploitation form (satellite,
                            cable, PTV, internet, mobile). The measures taken at the EU level should also
                            avoid discrimination between cable operators and over the top (“OTT”) players
                            (such as Hulu and Netflix).

                            The new system should moreover enhance transparency and legal certainty
                            regarding the copyright regime that will apply. The market behaviour of CMOs
                            should be regulated ex ante to avoid abuse of their dominant positions (which
                            today is common in several member states), and competition between collective
                            management organizations should be encouraged to increase the efficiency of the
                            system and help to drive a single market forward. It is however key to avoid the
                            accumulation of market power with only two to three large collective management
                            organizations in Europe.

                            Therefore, Cable Europe welcomes the Commission’s initiative for a Directive on
                            collective management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial
                            licensing of rights in musical works for online uses in the internal market.
                            However, it is Cable Europe’s view that the Commission‘s proposal has been
                            watered down during the legislative process, while new and more far-reaching
                            measures are imperative to secure well-functioning and commercially viable forms
                            of collective management of copyright both within and across Member States in
                            order to strengthen both innovation and accessibility of legal content.

                            An approach Cable Europe would approve of is the creation of a single licence
                            delivered by a one stop shop system, which would be optional for users, e.g. in the
                            event of right-holders – such as broadcasters – not being able or willing to provide
                            “all-rights-included” offers (“ARI”) (for the relationship between ARI offers and
                            licenses, please see the response to question 10). The single license would be
                            created for clearance of all content exploitation forms (fixed, mobile, online, cable,
                            DTT, etc) both at the horizontal (i.e. multi-territory) and the vertical (i.e. one
                            negotiation partner only) level. To ensure content accessibility in a one stop shop
                            system, it is essential to oblige collecting societies to contract with each other and
                            also to contract with right users who seek clearance.

                            The single license should firstly allow cable operators to clear – if needed – all
                            rights necessary to provide the content they want to their subscribers. The system
                            should however be flexible. It should allow users to choose their preferred option
                            and provide the possibility to clear only the rights they need, e.g. rights not
                            already covered by broadcasters’ ARI offers.

                            Secondly, cable operators active in several territories should be given the option to
                            choose for pan-European/multi-territory licensing. Cable Europe however wants to
                            stress that, if a multi-national licensing system is created, service providers active
                            on a purely national, regional and/or local level should have the same competitive
                            conditions as international providers. It has to be prevented that a two speed
                            market is created, where a company operating on a European single market basis
                            would have a better regulatory/operational environment than a company operating
                            on a national/regional basis.

                            It will also need to be ensured that the copyright users will be able to obtain
                            effective judicial/quasi-judicial remedies against excessive remuneration
                            claims by right-holders – both domestic and foreign. As things stand, the existing
                            national licensing systems already pose significant hurdles in this regard.


                            5.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management
                            organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the
                            necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it
                            necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service
                            provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is
                            not possible in certain European countries)?

                            6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are
                            there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the
                            necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it
                            necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service
                            recipients (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different
                            website than the one he is trying to access)?

                                                                                                                                     4
                            YES.

                            Cable Europe considers that service operators should have the possibility to
                            impose territorial restrictions under certain circumstances. This may be necessary
                            if differences between the various markets or national regulations of the Member
                            States justify differences in the terms and conditions of the retail offer. In addition,
                            national or regional players should not be required to clear rights for territories
                            outside of their footprint.


                            7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative,
                            including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
                            cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
                            ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


                            YES.

                            This question is addressed in the response to Question 4.


                            b.        Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what
                                      needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


                            1.        The act of “making available”

                            8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border
                            situations – i.e. when content is disseminated across borders –
                            sufficiently clear?

                            NO.

                            The making available right protects a complex act, consisting of different
                            constitutive acts, which may take place in different Member States (e.g. the
                            uploading of an audiovisual work by a person located in Member State A to a
                            server located in Member State B for transmission to an end-user in Member State
                            C). The scope of this making available right remains unclear.

                            Under the current Information Society Directive, the making available right is
                            protected as a species of the right of communication to the public, not as a sui
                            generis right. This general right of communication to the public also covers other
                            types of communication, such as broadcasting, simulcasting or webcasting (recital
                            23 of the Information Society Directive). This is for example confirmed in the
                            recent judgement of the ECJ in TVCatchup1. The ECJ decided that the
                            retransmission via the Internet of works included in terrestrial TV broadcasts
                            should be considered a communication to the public in the sense of article 3 of the
                            Information Society Directive.

                            The making available right is thus distinguished from the broadcasting right. As
                            discussed in the “Study on the Application of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright
                            and Related Rights in the Information Society” the distinctive factor seems to be
                            the control over the timing of transmission. In case of broadcasts or so-called
                            “push services”, the sender controls the transmission of the work (by contrast to
                            the user choosing when and where to access the works at his individual demand).
                            In case of a broadcast, the broadcaster determines the linear programme and the
                            user’s access coincides with the transmission of the programme. With a sliding
                            scale of interactivity, the exact delineation and relation between the rights of
                            communication to the public, broadcasting and making available is however not
                            always easy to determine2.

                            Cable Europe also deplores the obsolete regulatory differentiation between the
                            different distribution technologies and wishes to underscore the importance of a
                            technology neutral approach in copyright legislation applicable in national as well
                            as cross-border situations.

                            The business models of cable, DTH, DTT and DSL platform operators are
                            converging, with cable, satellite, terrestrial, mobile and OTT players all competing
                            directly for audience and establishing own, consumer-centric businesses based on
                            digital distribution technology. In this converged, increasingly technology-neutral
                            and platform independent market environment it appears questionable whether
                            the differences in regulation (more in particular relating to the scope of
                            authorization and the collective management of rights) between the different
                            distribution technologies are still justified. Although differences in regulation may
                            under certain circumstances be necessary, Cable Europe insists that discrimination
                            between service providers should be avoided (e.g. different legal regimes for cable
                            operators and OTT players, such as Netflix, can amount to discrimination).

                            An example of obsolete regulatory differentiation relates to the notion of cable
                            retransmission as regulated under the SatCab Directive. The underlying idea for
                            this concept was that while satellite TV/direct-to-home, terrestrial TV and mobile
                            TV were deemed direct communication to the public – for which all copyrights are
                            cleared between CMOs/producers and broadcasters – cable TV and IPTV were
                            deemed a secondary communication to the public and hence re-transmission –
                            with clearance through CMOs.

                            Such intervention of CMOs did to a certain extent make sense in a traditional
                            environment where the initial terrestrial broadcast was followed by a cable
                            retransmission by another entity. Nowadays, however, many broadcasters send
                            their signal – through a private encrypted satellite or optical fibre connection –
                            directly to the head ends of the cable network, inducing only one communication
                            to the public (“direct injection”).

                            Hence, in today’s world, differences get blurred and the regulatory differentiation
                            between distribution platforms is no longer valid. This is certainly true as there
                            seems to be no uniform understanding of the notion of “cable

                            retransmission”/direct injection in the case law and copyright legislations of the
                            various Member States:

                                Dutch and Norwegian case law considers that no cable retransmission occurs
                                when programme-carrying signals are injected directly into cable networks as
                                there is no retransmission of an initial transmission to the public.

                                A recent Belgian decision makes a more confused analysis. As noted in the
                                “Study on the Application of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright and Related
                                Rights in the Information Society”, the decision of 4 February 2013 of the
                                Antwerp Court of Appeal is not straightforward and difficult to understand. The
                                Court of appeal first observed that the cable transmission to the public
                                following a direct injection (of the programmes by the broadcaster into the
                                cable network) should be seen as single act of “broadcasting via the cable
                                network” and hence as one communication to the public. Yet later in the
                                decision, it qualifies the cable operator’s intervention as a cable retransmission.

                                There are also differences in legislation. In the UK and Austria, the terms
                                “retransmission by cable” receive a technology neutral interpretation, so that
                                the provision includes retransmission through the Internet.

                                The cable retransmission right in the German Copyright Act by contrast does
                                not extend to other technologies, such as the Internet. The cable
                                retransmission right was transposed in a technology-specific way. This has
                                consequences on the scope of application of the collective management of the
                                retransmission right.

                            Cable Europe considers this unclear and inconsistent regulatory differentiation to
                            be a barrier to innovation as well as to competition on fair terms.
                            Depending on the applicable regulation and/or the interpretation thereof,
                            mandatory collective management of rights will apply (or not) and additional
                            consents should be obtained, substantially increasing the costs for the cable
                            operators (and the public), even if it is questionable whether an additional consent
                            is required. Due to these legal uncertainties some cable operators are subject to
                            important transaction efforts, legal challenges and opportunity costs. As a result,
                            the clearing of copyrights is in many cases characterized by a high degree of
                            inefficiencies. It should be noted that in addition to clearing the audiovisual rights,
                            other elements incorporated in the audiovisual work, e.g. music, often require a
                            separate rights clearance which adds significant administrative and transaction
                            costs.

                            Other practical problems experienced by many cable operators as a result of the
                            unclear scope of the “making available” right include:

                                Difficulty to access content from other Member States or from third countries;
                                In certain jurisdictions, clearance of content produced by broadcasters
                                themselves is more difficult than clearance of content produced independently
                                from broadcasters (e.g. the Hollywood studios);
                                Same rights being held by different CMOs (in the case of joint authors who
                                decide each to grant rights to different CMOs);

                                                                                                                                     7
                                 Lack of transparency as regards to who owns the rights (different owners or
                                 CMOs in the various Member States);
                                 Double transfer of rights: right-holders transfer their rights to both producers
                                 and CMOs;
                                 Opposition from CMOs to all right included packages offered by broadcasters;
                                 In the case of retransmission: cable operators do not know which rights and
                                 whose rights will be used by broadcasters and consequently they are not in a
                                 position to correctly assess which rights they have to clear with the CMOs.

                            In order to overcome these problems, an improved, more effective, more
                            efficient, more competitive and more consistent transparent, technology
                            neutral rights management and clearance system for both musical and
                            audiovisual works across Europe is needed, as discussed under question 4.

                            With respect to extending the country of origin principle, Cable Europe believes
                            that further consultations and impact assessments are necessary as it is not clear
                            what the practical consequences could be of extending the “country of origin”
                            principles. All of these considerations require further investigation.


                            9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the
                            territorial scope of the “making available” right have an effect on the
                            recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an
                            author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights
                            or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including
                            the availability of injunctive relief3)?


                            --

                            2.       Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


                            10.   [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the
                            application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the
                            online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


                            YES.

                            Under the current legal framework, two (or more) rights may be involved in a
                            single act of exploitation (reproduction, communication to the public, making
                            available, cable retransmission etc.) the clearing of these rights complicates the
                            use of works by service providers and thus the availability of legal content. This is
                            certainly true if the separate rights are held by different persons/entities or
                            managed by different CMOs, imposing an additional burden upon the service


                            3
                              Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
                            an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                                                     8
                            providers. In this context, an obligation to enter into licensing agreements with
                            each other and with requesting users for collecting societies is indispensable.

                            More generally, Cable Europe considers this increasing fragmentation of rights
                            (online and offline) to be an important problem, to be further aggravated by the
                            intended right-holders’ ”right to choose” their collecting society in Art. 5 (2) of the
                            CRM draft. Such fragmentation results in greater uncertainty and barriers to
                            innovation. For example in the Netherlands, script writers and performing artists
                            have started to transfer their rights of (primary) communication to the public to
                            collecting societies, while the legal presumption has always been that the
                            producers own those rights.

                            The existence of two rights for a single act of exploitation online is confusing and
                            inefficient. The EU legal framework should be modified in order to consider the act
                            of making available in similar terms as the act of public communication. As a
                            consequence, the uploading of the content shall be the only act of exploitation i.e.
                            making available. The downloading by the end user should not be considered as an
                            act of exploitation, but as a mere technical copy.

                            The fragmentation of rights results in double or multiple remuneration for the
                            same usage process as consents should be obtained (and paid for) from different
                            right holders and/or CMOs. It also leads to legal uncertainty impeding innovation.

                            As with respect to cable retransmission                   rights, Cable Europe recalls that, pursuant
                            to Article 9 of the SatCab Directive,                     they may be exercised, as a matter of
                            principle, only in a collective manner,                   i.e. by a CMO. Article 10 does make an
                            exception for the rights exercised by                     a broadcaster in respect of its own and
                            acquired programmes.

                            Cable Europe believes that the system of ‘all rights included packages’ (ARI)
                            provided by broadcasters who wish to do so to cable operators should have the
                            same weight as – and should not be considered as an exception to – collective
                            management of rights. Against the background of market practices in many
                            member states, ARI should rather be considered as the principal form of rights
                            clearance in wireline as well as wireless distribution – both offline and online –
                            while collective management should be seen as an option in case of ARIs not being
                            provided. This would increase the overall efficiency of the rights clearance system.
                            Broadcasters should indeed be able to offer these cleared packages legally, as
                            intended by Article 10 of the SatCab Directive. However, too often these
                            commercial negotiations are not accepted by CMOs who - have the possibility to
                            block such deals4. As such, CMOs of a particular Member State sometimes refuse
                            to grant broadcasters of another Member State the necessary consent and insist
                            on clearance by the cable operator in their Member State. Further, CMOs in several
                            member states have shown a tendency to abuse their dominant positions, e.g. by
                            requesting unreasonable and unjustified license tariffs. With an increasing use of
                            ARIs, the scope for abusive behaviour by CMOs would decrease, which in turn
                            would improve the prerequisites for innovation and competition.

                            4
                              CMOs often argue that the exception of article 10 only applies to own programmes of the broadcasters
                            and not to programmes acquired from third party producers even if these producers have transferred
                            their right to the broadcaster to enable to offer ARI packages to intervening platform operators.

                                                                                                                                     9
                            It should at the same time be noted that the system of collective management of
                            rights and the ability for users to enter into license agreements with CMOs is
                            highly valuable and in some instances essential to the business of many users.

                            In order to solve the problems caused by the increasing fragmentation of rights
                            (and repertoire) and by the abuse of dominant positions, Cable Europe thus
                            supports any legislation that increases the possibility (no obligation) to offer ARI
                            packages, facilitates joint licensing and achieves the “bundling of rights”. Essential
                            in this regard is more transparency, in particular relating to the functioning of
                            CMOs. According to Cable Europe, any new legislation should ensure greater
                            transparency of rights management (which rights are held by each CMO and which
                            rights owners they represent) and of the basis for calculating the fees charged by
                            CMOs. In many instances, CMOs set tariffs unilaterally without giving commercial
                            negotiations a chance and the basis for calculation of the rate level is often totally
                            unclear. This is being addressed in the proposal for a Collective Rights
                            Management Directive but could be improved further.

                            As discussed under Question 8, the EU should help to install a new, more efficient
                            copyright clearance system which would help all market players to streamline their
                            transaction and management costs. Key to this new system is further transparency
                            and competition between CMOs as well as ax ante rules regulating the actions
                            taken by CMOs, which should increase the efficiency of the system. Again, it
                            should be highlighted that the accumulation of market power with only two to
                            three large CMOs in Europe must be avoided.

                            Finally, it is important to yet again stress that Cable Europe is not against the
                            collective management of rights, but that it is essential (from the point of view of
                            legal certainty) to ensure that, in situations where rights are managed collectively,
                            the management organizations can represent all the owners of the rights managed
                            collectively (and not only the rights owners who have to be a member of the
                            management organization at a certain time).

                            However, any legislation relating to such resale activities should exclude any
                            liability of the service providers in this respect. Moreover, Cable Europe opposes

                            C.       Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good
                                     idea?


                            15.    Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
                            identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


                            Cable Europe considers that a registration system at EU level could facilitate
                            licensing and enhance transparency. It will be indispensable for licensing in an EU-
                            wide market with a choice for right-holders where to allow the managing of their
                            repertoire or parts of it.

                            Cable Europe welcomes in this regard any proposal that would increase the
                            efficiency of the rights clearance system. The use of modern technology to identify
                            audiovisual works and their ownership is therefore an avenue to explore.

                            We therefore support initiatives such as the International Standard Audiovisual
                            Number (ISAN) and Global Repertoire Database (GRD) which are voluntary
                            registration systems for the identification of audiovisual and musical works.

                            With a unique number permanently assigned to an audiovisual work, ISAN is
                            useful for computerized applications, particularly those involving databases or the
                            exchange of information about audiovisual works. Also GRD, the scope of which is
                            to provide a single, comprehensive and authoritative representation of the global
                            ownership and control of musical works, will enhance efficiency, transparency and
                            certainty in rights clearance relating to musical works.

                            The registration system should provide identification for the work in question as
                            well as authorship, ownership and co-ownership. This means that the register has
                            to conduct a diligent investigation and the creator /right holder has to provide
                            enough proof that he is the author / owner. If the right holder wishes to transfer
                            some of his rights of the registered work, this should remain the liability of the
                            right holder who has to notify the transfer to the register.

                            Moreover, in the case of claims related to the author, the registration or non-
                            registration of a work should not affect the existence of the right. The purpose of
                            the registration is primarily to facilitate the licensing as much as possible.


                            16.      What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


                            Cable Europe considers that establishing a reliable online database to (better)
                            identify ownership or co-ownership of rights in musical compositions, audiovisual
                            works and books would be a very helpful mechanism to help legal certainty of
                            copyright clearance and provide more transparency as to which rights must be
                            cleared and with whom.

                            Such system would thus improve the functioning of the Single Market and foster
                            innovative services. It would also make it possible to quantify the use made of

                            works. When unilaterally setting royalty rates, CMOs often rely on assumptions
                            rather than on actual use. This could change following the introduction of such a
                            system.


                            17.      What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


                            As stated above, Cable Europe considers that a registration system at EU level
                            could facilitate licensing and enhance transparency.

                            However, we believe that one of the key issues will be the legal reliance that can
                            be made on such data. Who will be liable in case the data provided in the database
                            are incorrect? Who will verify the relevant information before it is added to the
                            database? What will be the procedure in case of disputed copyright? It is crucial
                            that the databases do not present misleading information that would ultimately
                            hinder the acquisition of rights. To avoid the latter problem, only copyrights
                            registered by right holders themselves on the database would be eligible for rights
                            clearance.

                            Moreover, it should be avoided that the full costs and the responsibilities for the
                            correctness of the data relating to the creation of a registration system should be
                            borne by the service providers as this would increase the costs of innovative
                            services for consumers in the EU.


                            18.   What incentives for registration by right holders could be
                            envisaged?

                            --

                            d.       How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers?


                            19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption
                            of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and
                            interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


                            The EU could support initiatives like ISAN and GRD by providing the necessary
                            legal framework promoting the development and use of such databases.

                            As such, the EU could envisage establishing a presumption in favour of the service
                            providers using such databases that they have obtained the necessary consents to
                            use the works concerned. This would certainly be an important incentive for the
                            service providers (and other users of content) to use databases managed in
                            cooperation with the right holders and other stake holders of the relevant industry.

                            E.       Term of protection – is it appropriate?


                            20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
                            digital environment?


                            YES.

                            There is no need to extend the existing terms of copyright protection. These terms
                            already go well beyond the minimum terms of protection required by the
                            applicable international agreements. Moreover, they are excessive and contrary to
                            the development of the digital environment and the promotion of and access to
                            culture.

                            Actually, the existing terms of protection should be shortened, at least, to the level
                            required by the international agreements (50 years after the death of the author -
                            art. 7.1 Berne Convention). The main justification for such a long duration, for the
                            Convention parties, was that of taking care of the author and his or her family.
                            More than a century after the entry into force of the Convention (1886), the fact
                            that copyright is normally assigned to, or contractually acquired by, enterprises
                            (i.e. non-natural persons) no longer justifies a term of protection whose main
                            parameter is the life of the author.

                            From an economic perspective, the time span to let authors and content producers
                            recoup an investment in the creation of works is much shorter. In the US, until the
                            entry into force of 1976 copyright reform, a registration system was in force and
                            the first 28-year term of protection could be renewed in order to gain a second
                            term of the same length. The Center for the Study of the Public Domain at Duke
                            University estimated that 85% of authors of works published in 1955 did not
                            renew their copyright after the expiration of the first 28-year term. Considering
                            the authors’ lack of interest in renewing the first copyright term, this means that
                            85% of copyright works created in 1955 might have come into the public domain
                            in 1983 if the pre-1976 law had still been in force.

                            Therefore, any extension of the terms of copyright protection would lead to a
                            significant reduction in the size of the public domain, a considerable source of
                            material freely available for use in innovative projects, both commercial and non-
                            profit making, and thereby contributing to cultural diversity. Such extension would
                            moreover increase the costs for service providers and consumers, as the right
                            holders enjoy an even longer period of monopoly, not even used by most of them.



                       III.          LIMITATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS IN THE SINGLE MARKET


                              21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and
                              exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the
                              Member States?

                            YES.

                            Cable Europe is generally supportive of the promotion of consistency in the high
                            level principles applying to licensing and the distribution of content across the EU
                            without pursuing an overly rigid pan-EU regime. Well-functioning, national
                            arrangements should indeed not be sacrificed in favour of an arbitrary approach to
                            harmonization. Harmonizing all limitations and exceptions completely without
                            leaving any flexibility is therefore not desirable and does not sufficiently take into
                            account the different legal traditions of the various Member States.

                            To the extent that a single market policy is advanced, Cable Europe considers it
                            should be on the basis of preserving existing elements of national arrangements
                            that are delivering beneficial outcomes. An overly generic or ‘lowest common
                            denominator’ approach would undoubtedly lead to unintended consequences.

                            However, in order to create a well-functioning multi-national licensing system, it
                            should also be avoided that important differences exist between the different
                            Member States, since such differences clearly hinder negotiations between service
                            providers and broadcasters of different Member States. Exceptions that are not
                            mandatory leave some leeway for right holders to contractually prohibit the use, to
                            license the use to the beneficiaries of the exception or to determine the conditions
                            under which the use could take place.

                            Some limitations and exceptions should therefore be harmonized and/or made
                            mandatory, as discussed in the response to Question 22.


                            22.   Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is
                            there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

                            YES.

                            With respect to the private copy and reprography exception (Article 5(2)(b) of the
                            Information Society Directive, we refer to the response to Questions 64 – 67.

                            Cable Europe considers that the exception relating to ephemeral reproductions by
                            broadcasting organizations provided in Article 5(2)(d) of the Information Society
                            Directive should be harmonized and/or made mandatory. The harmonization of
                            this exception will facilitate negotiations of cable operators with various
                            broadcasters from different Member States, invoking differences in copyright
                            legislation to justify differences in pricing.


                            23.   Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed
                            from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
                            [Open question]

                            YES.

                            While the provisions of the Directive 2000/31/EC (the E-Commerce Directive) are
                            clear with respect to the fact that mere conduit service providers are not liable for

                            the information transmitted over their network, in Belgium, CMO Sabam is
                            nevertheless trying to hold these service providers liable on the basis of the
                            allegation that such transmission constitutes a communication to the public by the
                            service provider within the meaning of article 3 of the Information Society
                            Directive.

                            Cable Europe therefore would welcome a modification of the Information Society
                            Directive so as to confirm that acts of transmission by mere conduit providers who
                            (i) do not initiate the transmission, (ii) do not select the receiver of the
                            transmission; and (iii) do not select or modify the information contained in the
                            transmission, cannot be assimilated to a communication to the public within the
                            meaning of article 3 of the Information Society Directive.


                            24.    Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide
                            for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for
                            limitations and exceptions?

                            YES.

                            In view of the rapid technological developments (e.g. emergence of new devices
                            and the convergence of the different distribution platforms), Cable Europe
                            considers that more flexibility is needed. Cable Europe supports in this regard a
                            technology, services and rights neutral legal framework, including more “open”
                            exceptions or limitations. Such legal framework would avoid the need for
                            amendments every time new technological developments occur and provide more
                            legal certainty for service providers offering innovative packages to their
                            subscribers.


                            25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility?
                            (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of
                            the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g.
                            in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)?
                            Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
                            disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the
                            functioning of the Internal Market. [Open question]


                            The current application of the exceptions and the three step test (art. 5.5 Directive
                            29/2001) within the EU is not objective nor proportionate. The broad concept of
                            the three step test (art. 5.5 Directive 29/2001): (I) special certain cases, (II)
                            which may not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and (III) not
                            unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder, taking account
                            of the legitimate interests of third parties, has led to diverging interpretations
                            among scholars and national courts, thereby creating legal uncertainty and giving
                            rise to an extremely high and unjustified protection for right-holders, who may try
                            to include any exceptions into the scope of the three step test in order to avoid
                            their use. As a result, the system of exceptions and the three step test should be
                            much more flexible and it should also be based on an economic principle. It should
                            also be clarified that the three step test can at most serve as guidance for the

                                                                                                                                     15
                            interpretation of an exception in case of doubt, but not lead to the non-application
                            of the exception in cases where the legal conditions for its applications are clearly
                            fulfilled.

                            Cable Europe supports an (attenuated version of a) fair use provision in a
                            technology, services and rights neutral legal framework. Cable Europe refers in
                            this regard to the Wittem Copyright Code drafted by European copyright
                            academics which provides for a combination of a common law style open-ended
                            system of limitations and a civil law style exhaustive enumeration. This code
                            enumerates several (technology neutral) limitations to copyright and moreover
                            provides for a more general provision, extending the scope of the specifically
                            enumerated limitations by permitting other uses that are similar to any of the uses
                            enumerated, subject to the operation of the three-step test.

                            This extension to similar uses provides the system with a flexibility which is
                            indispensable in view of the fact that it is impossible to foresee all the situations in
                            which a limitation could be justified. On the other hand, the possibility of flexibility
                            is narrowed down to uses ‘similar’ to the ones expressly enumerated: (I) special
                            certain cases, (II) which may not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work
                            and (III) not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder,
                            taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties (art 5.5 Directive
                            29/2001). Thus, limitations should in any case be drafted in technology neutral
                            wording to avoid the need for amendments every time new technological
                            developments occur.

                            For all these reasons, Cable Europe advocates the creation of a proportionality test
                            or fair use test based upon economic principles and taking into consideration the
                            real harm or damage that is inflicted upon the rights holder.


                            26.   Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your
                            experience, constitutes a problem?

                            YES.

                            As discussed under Question 21, differences between the different Member States
                            hinder negotiations between service providers and broadcasters of different
                            Member States and the establishment of an (optional) pan-European licensing
                            system.


                            27.   In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national
                            level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair
                            compensation” be addressed, when such compensation is part of the
                            exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?) [Open question]


                            Cable Europe supports any legislation that guarantees a fair compensation for right
                            holders. However, such legislation should ensure that double payments for one
                            and the same copyright relevant act are excluded.

                        IV.          PRIVATE COPYING AND REPROGRAPHY


                            64.    In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
                            application of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the
                            digital environment?


                            YES.

                            As discussed under Question 2, market developments, driven by the emergence of
                            new devices and changes in customer habits, cause subscribers to want their
                            channels and other content offered by their cable operator to be “portable”
                            anywhere in the home, in the country, in Europe and beyond. In addition,
                            customers expect to be able to watch this content at the time that suits them best
                            rather than when they are broadcasted.

                            In order to satisfy the demand of these customers, cable operators are offering
                            storage services, such as Personal Video Recording. These services are
                            increasingly access-based: the content is no longer stored on the subscribers’
                            devices but on server storage space provided by the cable operator (in the
                            “cloud”), which enhances their efficiency and accessibility. Notwithstanding the fact
                            that such services serve the same goals as traditional PVR devices, it currently
                            remains unclear what conditions need to be complied with for them to fall within
                            the scope of the private copying exceptions as implemented in the various Member
                            States. Some national regulations indeed only exempt reproductions by natural
                            persons for private use that are made at home. It is unclear whether or not copies
                            made by a natural person (subscriber of the cable operators) but stored in the
                            “cloud” fall within this scope. The legal uncertainty surrounding these innovative
                            services is hampering their development.

                            Cable Europe therefore supports initiatives to clarify and harmonize the scope of
                            the private copying exceptions (article 5.2b of Directive EC/29/2001) in the digital
                            environment, which should in any case include copies made by natural persons
                            stored in the “cloud”, as it is affirmed within the Castex report 5 approved by the
                            European Parliament on 27 February 2014; Point 29).


                            65.    Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the
                            context of a service that has been licensed by right holders, and where
                            the harm to the right holder is minimal, be subject to private copying
                            levies?

                            NO.

                            In line with the Recommendations resulting from the Mediation on Private Copying
                            and Reprography Levies by former Commissioner António Vitorino, Cable Europe
                            considers that usage of a work in a digital environment made for private purposes
                            in the context of a service that has been licensed by right holders and do not
                            cause harm should not require additional remuneration in the form of private
                            copying levies. Indeed, the content in question is already subject to copyright
                            remuneration as part of the service delivery.

                            As argued by former Commissioner António Vitorino, the opposite view would pave
                            the way for double payments, hindering innovative developments to the benefit of
                            all market players, including right holders.


                            66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to
                            online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for
                            instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the
                            development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
                            and right holders’ revenue on the other? [Open question]


                            As previously indicated, customers increasingly expect to have access to content
                            on different devices, when and wherever they please. Online services based on
                            cloud solutions are an important part of the new business models that are being
                            developed to meet these expectations. Changes in the regulatory framework that
                            would include additional levies with respect to such online services would make
                            them more expensive for subscribers. Such increase in price would certainly harm
                            the development of new business developments to meet the customers’
                            expectations and hinder innovation.

                            On the other hand, if no new levies are imposed, the impact on the right holder’s
                            revenue would be minimal. Cable Europe emphasizes in this regard that the
                            customers’ willingness to pay for additional copies of the same work decreases
                            proportionally with the number of copies. The losses incurred by right holders due
                            to lost licensing opportunities ('economic harm'), i.e. the additional payment they
                            would have received for these additional copies if there were no exception, is
                            therefore in any case minimal.

                            Moreover, additional levies mean that a collecting system with regard to these new
                            levies will have to be developed. The cost and difficulties of establishing such a
                            system should not be underestimated, once again hindering the development of
                            new and innovative business models.

                            Cable Europe therefore opposes changes in levies with respect to the application to
                            online services. The possible harm to right holders is in any case minimal.
                            Moreover, imposing additional levies on online services does not outweigh the cost
                            of collecting these levies nor the negative impact it will have on innovation.

                            Cable Europe supports a levy system where Members may choose between two
                            different systems:

                                 1) Firstly, a system in which the payment of levies for private copies is
                                    included within the “general budget” of the State (case of Spain). Through
                                    this system, collecting societies may directly receive their correspondent
                                    incomes for private copies from the State (taxes paid by all citizens) for an
                                    eventual distribution among authors. These amounts of money should

                                   exclude, in any case, digital copies made in the cloud for VOD services,
                                   which do not bring harm to the author (see Questions 64, 65).
                                2) Secondly, in cases in which the payment of levies must be made taking into
                                   consideration every single device (CDs, DVD etc.) because of a national
                                   obligation as such, Cable Europe recommends keeping the liability with
                                   manufactures and/or importers for several reasons:

                                ·       maintaining liability with manufacturers in combination with predictable
                                ex ante exemption schemes was identified as one possible option in the
                                Vitorino report 6, while shifting liability to retail was the other option;

                                ·       maintaining liability with manufacturers/importers has also been
                                suggested in the Castex report 7 (Point 11), which has recently been approved
                                by the European Parliament on 26 February 2014.

                                ·        keeping liability with manufacturers/importers is also supported by
                                collecting societies 8 and at the same time not advocated by any major
                                European ICT companies;

                                ·      manufacturers market shares are more concentrated and consistent
                                across member states than relevant retail market shares 9;

                                ·         shifting liability based on case law is argued on confusing grounds,
                                responsibility for collecting levies at the point of sale by no means requires
                                shift in liability, any efficiency that can be achieved do not require a shift in
                                liability and hence this latter intervention would be unnecessary and excessive;

                                ·      a few, concentrated, global manufacturers are better equipped ( due to
                                consistent pan-European market presence, better resourced and operate on
                                higher economies of scale) to come up with an efficient common pan-European
                                technical solution to collect levies effectively than retailers, especially SMB,
                                who are less concentrated and less homogenous across the internal market;

                                ·     the case made by those promoting shift to retail is constructed on
                                complex argumentation based on several dependent policy actions being
                                implemented beforehand, e.g. “if and then” assumptions about policy
                                implementations regarding: common definitions, improved governance,

                                improved tariff negotiation process, greater transparency and overall
                                simplification. Obviously, the necessity of such complex argumentation
                                regarding a seemingly straight forward issue questions fundamentally the
                                merits and sensibility of the position.

                             In this second possibility, private copies made in the cloud due to the offer of VOD
                             services, should also be excluded from the payment because of the lack of harm
                             (Questions 64, 65).


                        V.           FAIR REMUNERATION OF AUTHORS AND PERFORMERS




                             72.   [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best
                             mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
                             adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and
                             performances?


                             Cable Europe supports a fair remuneration for the exploitation of works and
                             performances. As discussed under Questions 73 and 74, such fair remuneration
                             should however be established in a transparent way and not imply double
                             payments for one single copyright relevant act relating to one single work or
                             performance.


                             73.   Is there need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain
                             clauses in contracts)?


                             YES.

                             This question will be addressed together with Question 74.




                             74.   If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would
                             you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?


                             Firstly, Cable Europe would like to stress that action at the European level with
                             regard to adequate remuneration for exploitation of copyrighted material should
                             also take into account the position of service providers and (ultimately)
                             consumers. When service providers are confronted with requests from CMOs to
                             compensate the use of works and performances, they indeed encounter a number
                             of problems.

                             An important problem in this regard is the lack of transparency. In particular,
                             Cable Europe deplores the lack of transparency relating to the level of


European Cable Communications Association

                                                                                                                                     21
                            remuneration and the corresponding lack of any effective or sufficiently expedited
                            system of judicial/quasi-judicial remedies. This problem has already been raised in
                            several Member States. The Belgian legislator, for example, proposes to establish
                            an independent regulator to provide advice on the remuneration requested by the
                            CMOs and to act as an arbitrator10.

                            Cable Europe therefore strongly believes that greater transparency should be
                            achieved with respect to the basis for calculating the fees charged by CMOs.
                            Currently, these fees are set unilaterally without giving commercial negotiations a
                            chance and the basis for the calculation of the rate is often unclear and does not
                            take into account the effective use. Very often, a unilateral and unsubstantiated
                            rate is set and multiplied by the potential number of users without regard to the
                            effective number of users. There is also a lack of transparency about which right
                            holders are represented by the CMO (due to the fragmentation of the repertoire,
                            as discussed in Question 10) and how the collected sums are redistributed to the
                            right holders.

                            Consequently, a stricter and more expedited supervision of remuneration levels
                            should be considered. Rights clearance should also be carried out on the basis of
                            commercial negotiations in the first place with an arbitration or tribunal oversight.
                            Moreover, action is needed at the EU level to provide clarification regarding the
                            judicial remedies available to cable operators in response to an abusive exercise of
                            rights. Member States should be required to set up an effective system of judicial
                            or quasi-judicial remedies, such as the Copyright Tribunal in the UK that
                            adjudicates commercial licensing disputes between CMOs and users of copyright
                            material.

                            Another important issue that should be addressed with regard to fair remuneration
                            is the prevention of double payments for a single communication of copyrighted
                            material.

                            In this respect, it should be avoided that national legislation leads to double
                            remuneration for the same usage processes. In Germany, for example, section
                            20b paragraph 2 of the German Urhebergesetz (UrhG German Copyright Act)
                            entitles CMOs to receive two payment streams on separate legal grounds: on the
                            basis of a license payment pursuant to section 20b paragraph 1 (possibly via a
                            broadcaster), and additionally on the basis of the legal claim pursuant to section
                            20b paragraph 2 of the Copyright Act. A similar legislation applies in Spain.

                            There is moreover a need to clarify, in line with the decision by the European Court
                            of Justice in Airfield, that, the intervention of a cable operator as to the signals
                            emitted by the broadcasters when television programs are transmitted via cable,
                            essentially consists in receiving those signals from the broadcasters, possibly
                            decoding, encrypting and sending them to the audience. For example, Free-TV
                            programs, distributed wirelessly in encrypted form only (as is increasingly the case
                            for HDTV programs in Germany, for example), may be decrypted by the cable
                            company if it has the right to carry the program. This single intervention falls

                              The Belgian government has recently adopted Book XI of the new Code of economic law. Book XI
                            deals with the intellectual property rights and will soon be discussed in Parliament.

                                                                                                                                     22
                             within the customary technical activities to prepare the signals for their
                             introduction into the cable communication chain. It is often necessary in order to
                             make the cable communication feasible or to facilitate it. Consequently, this
                             intervention must be classified as a normal technical procedure relating to the
                             program-carrying signals. It should therefore not be subject to a separate
                             authorization, so that only one remuneration is due for the communication of the
                             program via cable.

                             Double payments of remuneration can also result from a lack of transparency as to
                             whom CMOs represent and the fragmentation of the repertoire. For example in the
                             Netherlands, the legal presumption has always been that producers own the rights
                             of communication to the public, but script writers and performing artists have
                             started to transfer their rights to CMOs. This results in a greater uncertainty and
                             could lead to multiple remunerations for the use of the same copyrighted work.

                             Some authors/performers do not have an exclusive right but a right to equitable
                             remuneration. Performers, for example, have no exclusive cable retransmission
                             right but a right to equitable remuneration by the producers of audio-visual works.
                             In Belgium, for example, there is a proposal to make this right non-transferable
                             and subject to collective rights management. This implies a risk that cable
                             operators are confronted with a new claim for works for which they already paid
                             the broadcasters

                             Lastly, consistent with our comments with regard to territoriality (cfr. Questions 1
                             to 7), a similar issue could arise when communication of a protected work in one
                             Member State triggers the obligation to pay a remuneration in different Member
                             States based on the respective national legislations.



                       VI.           RESPECT FOR RIGHTS


                             75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more
                                 efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial
                                 purpose?


                             NO.

                             Cable Europe and its members recognise the need for right-holders to have a
                             proper instrument for enforcing their rights and understand the concern of finding
                             an answer to the piracy problem, in particular in a commercial context. However,
                             we are of the opinion that the current civil enforcement system (including national
                             measures implementing Directive 2004/48 and Directive 2001/29) provides for
                             sufficient statutory enforcement measures for right-holders and does not need to
                             be revised. Furthermore we believe that compelling, affordable legal alternatives
                             remain the primary answer to piracy.

                             Rather than issuing additional statutory enforcement measures , the focus of any
                             initiatives taken by the Commission should be directed towards correct

                                                                                                                                     23
                            implementation of Directives 2004/48 and 2001/29 at national level and ensuring
                            that national enforcement remains consistent with the requirements of Directive
                            2000/31 and with the need to strike a right balance with fundamental rights and
                            freedoms, including the rights to privacy, the freedom of information and the
                            freedom to conduct business (see the response to question 76 and 77).

                            Cable Europe also opposes the idea of introducing notification mechanisms which
                            would require intermediaries – without prior intervention of a court – to block
                            access to or remove information based upon the mere allegation of by right-holder
                            that this information constitutes copyright infringing material (see the synthesis of
                            responses to the Consultation on “Civil enforcement of intellectual property rights”
                            published in July 2013). Similarly, Cable Europe opposes notification mechanisms
                            that require intermediaries to suspend user accounts without prior intervention of
                            a Court. Such mechanisms would lead to precautionary private censorship and
                            threaten fundamental rights, such as the right to due process, the protection of
                            personal data and the freedom of expression. Any act that has a chilling effect on
                            the freedom of speech can only be taken by a competent judicial authority.


                            76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow
                                for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service
                                providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain
                                name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements
                                with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful
                                to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?


                            YES.

                            Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/29 and the third sentence of Article 11 of Directive
                            2004/48 enable right-holders to apply for an injunction against intermediaries
                            whose services are being used by a third party to infringe their rights, including for
                            commercial purposes. Such injunctions are effectively being used in the Member
                            States.

                            The ECJ has issued a number of judgements providing guidance on the balance to
                            be struck between the different rights and interests affected (see for example
                            Cases C-324/09, L’Oréal and Others, C-70/10, Scarlet Extended, and C-360/10,
                            Sabam). Cable Europe would welcome a Commission initiative to translate this
                            case law into clear guidelines for national authorities and courts so as to facilitate a
                            consistent approach across Member States. Such guidelines should clarify, among
                            others, that:

                                     injunctions must specify the measures to be taken by intermediaries and
                                     must take into account the specific (technological) limitations faced by
                                     intermediaries. For instance, internet access providers cannot be held
                                     liable when users circumvent their blocking measures (e.g. by using
                                     encryption or proxy servers) (Adv. Gen. Villalón, Case C-314/12, UPC
                                     Telekabel, par. 25, 85-90, 99);
                                     injunctions that oblige intermediaries to proactively search for new
                                     infringements (e.g. copies of an infringing website under other domain

                                     as general monitoring obligations and should not be imposed (Case
                                     C-324/09, L’Oréal and Others, par. 139; Case C-70/10, Scarlet Extended,
                                     par. 36; Case C-360/10, Sabam, par. 36-38; Adv. Gen. Villalón, Case C-
                                     314/12, UPC Telekabel, par. 78);
                                     injunctions that require intermediaries to install complicated and costly
                                     systems at their own expense are not proportionate and do not strike a fair
                                     balance between the protection of copyright and the protection of the
                                     fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures (Case
                                     C-70/10, Scarlet Extended, par. 48; Case C-360/10, Sabam, par. 46);
                                     injunctions should not lead to the blocking of legitimate content (Case C-
                                     70/10, Scarlet Extended, par. 52; Case C-360/10, Sabam, par. 50; Adv.
                                     Gen. Villalón, Case C-314/12, UPC Telekabel, par. 82);
                                     rightholders may be required to bear some of the costs for the intervention
                                     of intermediaries in the fight against piracy (Case C-70/10, Scarlet
                                     Extended, par. 48; Case C-360/10, Sabam, par. 46; Adv. Gen. Villalón,
                                     Case C-314/12, UPC Telekabel, par. 106);
                                     rightholders should – to the extent possible – address the infringer before
                                     involving the intermediary (Adv. Gen. Villalón, Case C-314/12, UPC
                                     Telekabel, par. 107).




                            77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right
                                balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright
                                respected and other rights such as the protection of private life and
                                protection of personal data?


                            The ECJ has repeatedly insisted on the need to strike a right balance between the
                            right of copyright owners to have their copyright respected and the fundamental
                            rights and freedoms of other affected parties, such as the freedom to conduct a
                            business enjoyed by intermediaries, the freedom of speech and information of
                            consumers, and the right to the protection of one’s privacy and personal data
                            (Cases C-275/06, Promusicae, par. 65-70, C-324/09, L’Oréal and Others, par. 143,
                            C-70/10 Scarlet Extended and C-360/10, Sabam). The ECJ has also provided
                            guidance as to the delineation of what such balance must look like. Cable Europe
                            therefore believes that it is unnecessary to amend the current civil enforcement
                            framework. It would nonetheless be useful for the Commission to translate this
                            case law into clear guidelines for national authorities and courts so as to facilitate a
                            consistent approach across Member States.

                            These guidelines could include the following principles:

                                     Right-holders and enforcers – at national, European and international level
                                     – should cooperate and focus their efforts on enforcement action directed at
                                     the direct infringers.

                                     Cable Europe is concerned by tendencies of right-holders to invoke the right
                                     of information of Article 8 Directive 2004/48 in relation to intermediaries

                                                                                                                                     25
                                     outside of judicial proceedings to obtain IP addresses and establish that the
                                     infringer has acted on a commercial scale. Cable Europe is certainly not
                                     opposed to providing this kind of information when cable operators are in
                                     possession of the information being requested. However, in view of the
                                     need to strike a fair balance between the respective rights, it must be
                                     guaranteed that:

                                     o    automatic, general obligations for intermediaries to provide information
                                          in any circumstance must not be allowed, let alone without the
                                          intervention of a court;
                                     o    intermediaries can only be obliged to provide the information they
                                          possess and cannot be held liable if (i) a certain user cannot be
                                          identified by means of the data at hand, (ii) a person who is identified
                                          by the data at hand does not correspond with the actual infringer, and
                                          (iii) a user provided incorrect information with respect to its identity
                                          and/or the purpose of its use of the services (e.g. a commercial
                                          purpose);
                                     o    the costs for complying with information requests should not be borne
                                          exclusively by the intermediaries but should – at least in part – be
                                          relieved by the right-holders.

                                     Similarly, injunctions to suspend the account of a particular subscriber (e.g.
                                     recent case “Nito 75”, Audiencia Provincial de Barcelona, Spain), will in
                                     most of the cases be unjustified and disproportional for several reasons:

                                     o    Neither the right holder nor the ISP can completely be certain whether
                                          the subscriber is identical to the alleged infringer.
                                     o    An internet connection has become an essential source of information.
                                          Its suspension might disproportionately limit the freedom of expression,
                                          which also includes the right to receive and impart information and
                                          ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers
                                          (art. 10 Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
                                          Fundamental Freedoms).

                                     Courts and authorities should refrain from imposing injunctions to
                                     intermediaries if these injunctions will not lead to an effective reduction of
                                     infringements of the copyright protected material and/or of the harm or
                                     damage inflicted upon the rights holder.

                                     Finally, rights holders should be required to reimburse all costs caused by
                                     the implementation of injunctions (including costs for additional
                                     infrastructure and labour costs).


                            78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright
                                Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights
                                and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single
                                framework for enforcement?


                            NO OPINION.

                            79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the
                                EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member States
                                legislation mean that this is a longer term project? [Open Question]




                            80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal
                                framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such
                                matters should be addressed [Open Question]
