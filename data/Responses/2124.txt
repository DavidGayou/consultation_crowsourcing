     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.
10
    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of

16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               10
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

     NO
     NO OPINION

2.         Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                              11
10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
The provision of a hyperlink to a work should not be protected under copyright or
subject to the authorisation of the right holder under any circumstances. Granting this
protection to hyperlinks and requiring users to seek permission of copyright holders or
obtain licences for their use would have a severely negative impact on the nature of the
web as a network for accessing and sharing knowledge and would inhibit creation and
innovation.

The viewing of a web-page where this implies temporary reproduction of a work or
other subject matter protected under copyright should not be subject to the
authorisation of the right holder. Right holders wishing to restrict access to their content
on the web can currently place sufficient technical restrictions (such as pay-walls) to
gain remuneration or to control access and use. Any further measures would have a
negative impact on the nature of the web as a network for accessing and sharing
knowledge and would inhibit creation and innovation.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
27
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              13

C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
     NO
     NO OPINION


16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
A registration system at EU level could facilitate rights clearance processes, decrease the
number of orphan works and enable the lawful use of copyright works. Right holders
29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             14
would be able to declare ownership of works (and gain attribution and/or remuneration
through their use) and users would have a clear and easy method of identifying and
contacting the right holder.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
The system’s advantages and/or disadvantages would arise from its ability to meet the
needs and interests of rightholders and users. As noted in the response to Q.16, effective
regulation, a high standard of user experience and interoperability of the system would
be critical to its success. Effective regulation should ensure that the registration system
is regarded as a reliable source of rights information and prevent false claims of right
ownership. Interoperability would avoid duplication of effort by right holders who may
have already submitted rights metadata to similar systems on a more local level.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
With a robust registration system in place, the additional income and publicity (through
attribution) that could be gained from participation would be an incentive for
registration by rightholders. Usability and interoperability could also influence right
holders’ use of the register (poor usability and interoperability would lead to frustration
and additional costs).
As noted in the Libraries and Archives Copyright Alliance’s submission, more firm
measures could be introduced as an incentive for registration such as the requirement to
register a work before an enforcement action could be taken. Another possible incentive
would be the introduction of new rules that require rightholders to register their work
in order to retain their ownership of copyright for a longer term (e.g. life + 70 years),
beyond a shorter initial term of protection (e.g. 20 years).

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such


31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

                                                                                                       15
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
We believe that the EU has an important role in ensuring cross-boundary
standardisation of identifiers and in promoting the development and interoperability of
rights ownership and permissions databases. Rights databases should be based on open
standards and free of charge to right holders and users, and the data captured should be
made available to other databases (e.g. via API).
Please refer to the response in the UK Libraries and Archives Copyright Alliance’s
submission.

E.       Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain

     NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
Only a small proportion of copyright works created since the second half of the
nineteenth century, even where they were created with commercial intent, retain their
commercial value for the full period of 70 years after the current term of copyright
protection. And yet, currently, the term of protection creates an uncertainty regarding
the copyright status of works that were created at the end of the nineteenth century.
Harmonising the term of copyright with the Berne Convention’s minimum term of 50
years after the death of the author would be a first step towards addressing this issue. It
would enable more works to be made available for the benefit of creativity, innovation
and cultural diversity.
However, within the rapidly changing digital environment and as suggested in our
response to Q.18, we would argue that there needs to be a discussion on the benefits of
such a long term of copyright protection as offered under the Berne Convention. This
discussion, in which all stakeholder groups should be represented fairly, should look at
the advantages and disadvantages of a shorter copyright term for right holders but also
users of copyright works (be they educational, cultural or commercial).

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member

States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
The fact that most limitations and exceptions included in EU law is optional for Member
States undermines the potential opportunity of achieving cross-border harmonisation.
Despite setting parameters for exceptions and limitations, the current situation allows
disharmony to continue and creates uncertainty regarding the permitted uses of
copyright works from and within other Member States (e.g. regarding the definition of
‘non-commercial’).
Libraries can fulfil their public mission of collecting, preserving and giving access to
knowledge more effectively by harnessing opportunities arising from the use of digital
technologies to widen access, broaden collaborative activities and extend services to
remote users, and it is essential that they are supported by an up-to-date and robust
framework of exceptions and limitations. This year, proposed changes to UK copyright
law will extend the exceptions and limitations so that they are better aligned with the
exceptions and limitations listed in Directive 2001/29/EC. Had the adoption of those

40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           18

currently optional should be made mandatory and the same principle should be applied
to future directives for reasons described in our response to Q.21. This will contribute

which recommends the following limitations and exceptions:
1. Introducing the principle that contracts and technical protection measures are never
allowed to override existing and new limitations and exceptions in the EU. Furthermore,
it should be an offence to impose technical protection measures on any material that is
no longer in copyright;
2. Introducing a ‘right to lend’ for libraries, to include the right to lend digital media
such as e-books by remote download;
3. Introducing a specific exception for text and data mining which applies to both
commercial and non-commercial purposes, as well as published and unpublished works;
4. Make it an offence for any person or organisation to falsely claim that they own the
copyright to a work, make unjustified threats of an infringement action, or set up
business models based on infringements by not fully disclosing that works are in
copyright;



                                                                                       19
5. Introducing an exception permitting libraries, archives and museums to undertake
mass digitisation of out-of-commerce works (including orphan works) for non-
commercial purposes and to communicate them to the public, without the need for a
diligent search for each individual rights holder;
6. Introducing an exception, as has recently occurred in Germany, requiring publicly
and charity-funded published research to be made available to the public free of charge
in an Open Access online repository within a stated number of months following original
publication;
7. Introducing an exception to the communication to the public right to permit research
access to retracted and withdrawn works held in libraries and archives in digital
formats that had previously been communicated to the public;
8. Introducing an exception for recording and communicating of broadcasts by
educational establishments to students based elsewhere in the EU.
……….……………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
There is a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory
framework for limitations and exceptions in order to respond to the pace of
technological change and achieve harmonisation with other frameworks that exist
outside the EU.
A more versatile and responsive framework at EU level would lead to more swift
changes to copyright law within and across Member States to maintain the balance the
interests of rights holders and users in the face of technological change. This could be
achieved through the adoption of a ‘fair use’ provision based on the US model, which is
further discussed in our answer to Q.25.
Digital technologies enable the use of copyright works on a global scale and more
flexibility is needed in order to seize opportunities to harmonize EU law and that of
jurisdictions beyond the boundaries of the EU (with fair dealing in the United States, for
example).

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation

open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and

disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
The two best approaches to providing for flexibility would be the periodic revision of
directives and built-in flexibility. The degree of flexibility offered by periodic revision
would depend on the frequency of these revisions but also the process by which changes
would be introduced. Built-in flexibility in the form of a fair use provision based on the
US model would be a more direct (and preferred) way of introducing flexibility. This
would lead to an increase in litigation, but it would also enable businesses to seize
opportunities created by new technologies more quickly (as discussed in the Hargreaves
Review in the UK).

A.         Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or

limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.         Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
Preservation is a core aspect of the Library’s work and, as the medium of copyright
works and the methods of preservation diversify and develop with technological change,
it is essential that this activity is supported by exceptions and limitations that are
balanced and appropriate. As an institutional user in the UK, the preservation
exception has for many years been too narrow to ensure that copyright works in our
collections are preserved in the most suitable and cost effective way. The current
exception (which is expected to change this year) permits a librarian or archivist to
make ‘a copy’ of a literary, dramatic or musical work for the purpose of preservation.
Not only does this not include the copying of artistic works, sound recordings and films
for the purposes of preservation, but it also implies that only a single copy may be made,
thereby ruling out digital methods of preservation to all intents and purposes. Digital
preservation is now regarded as our primary method of preserving collections, but it is a
method in which the creation of multiple copies is not only unavoidable but also
regarded as good practice. This creates significant barriers to the preservation of born-
digital archives, a rapidly growing section of the Library’s collections, which will lead to
significant additional costs (due to format obsolescence, etc) if they are not addressed
immediately.
The preservation exception as implemented in UK copyright law applies only to works
in the ‘permanent collection’. The National Library of Wales has held legal deposit

43
     Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.

                                                                                           22
status (giving it the right to receive a copy of all printed publication published in
Britain) for over a century, but there is a question whether this material (which is ageing
and much of which is out of commerce) could be copied under the exception for
preservation. Much of the archival material acquired by the Library during its early
years is also held on deposit, as was the custom at that time, but is regarded de facto as
part of our permanent collections. While it is understood that in certain circumstances it
would be sensible to apply the exception only to permanent collections, it is nevertheless
a barrier to the Library’s work in preserving deposited material in its care where it
would clearly not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter
and would not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.
The UK Government proposes to extend the exception to cover all types of copyright
works and to permit the making of multiple copies. These changes are long overdue and
would have been addressed much sooner had the Directive been more specific with
regard to enabling (digital) preservation and an exception made mandatory for Member
States.
Article 5(2)(c) is limited to organisations that are ‘not for direct or indirect economic or
commercial advantage’, which is open to interpretation and has also limited the scope of
the exception in UK copyright law. We would argue that this exception should be
extended to the organisations listed regardless of whether they are commercial or non-
commercial. We agree that restrictions should apply to the use of preservation copies in
order to protect the interests of the copyright holder, but the priority should be to
safeguard the future existence and access of the work from loss, deterioration,
destruction and/or format obsolescence.

[Open question]
We welcome the proposed changes to UK copyright law, but a more specific Directive
could have addressed barriers to preservation much sooner. Exceptions and limitations
introduced in Directives should be made mandatory not only to harmonise copyright
law between countries but to respond to the pace of technological change.
The restriction in Article 5(2)(c) could be addressed by an amendment.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
The National Library of Wales has embraced digital technologies as a means of
providing access to its collections and while we have developed the capacity to undertake
digitisation on a mass-scale, the management of copyright is one of the main challenges
to making a large section of this material accessible online (published works created
since the beginning of the twentieth century and unpublished works).

As an institutional user (a), the Library provides remote access to licensed e-resources to
registered users with postcodes based in Wales. These resources are supplied by a
number of publishers. This restriction on access is due to the fact that the licence is
purchased using public funding from the Welsh Government. While it would be
desirable to extend access to all of the Library’s registered users regardless of where
they are based, we are also aware that, without changes to legislation, this would lead to
a significant increase in the licence fee and possibly the cessation of the service.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

33.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Changes to legislation could permit libraries to provide their registered users with
remote online access to more of their collections, regardless of where those users reside
(rather than solely via dedicated terminals). This should also be underpinned by
legislation to prevent contract terms and/or technological protection measures from
overriding exceptions and limitations.

3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?

The National Library of Wales has not negotiated agreements to enable the electronic
lending (e-lending) of books or other materials held in its collections. We are aware,
however, that libraries that have negotiated agreements of this nature have encountered
difficulties. Please refer to the UK Libraries and Archives Copyright Alliance’s
submission.




37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
The National Library of Wales does not ‘lend’ analogue or digital collections to our
users, but we find that there are significant differences between the management of
physical and online collections which may be relevant to this discussion. The main
difference is that giving access to collections online (primarily through the outputs of
digitisation projects) requires management of intellectual property rights (IPR). IPR
management and the cost of digitisation are the two main barriers to widening access to
our collections. While physical collections require space and staff to provide access to
items on the premises, the cost of digital collections (once digitised and made accessible
online) lies in offering secure and sustainable long-term access to works in the face of
technological change. Levels of access also vary between items and collections depending
on the terms under which they were acquired, digitised and/or made accessible to users.
For example, access to non-print material acquired under The Legal Deposit Libraries
(Non-Print Works) Regulations 2013 can only be given on the premises, there are e-
publications which are accessible only to readers whose home address is within Wales,
and there are other digital collections which can be access anywhere in the world. Born-
digital materials can also be subject to non-negotiable licence terms and Technological
Protection Measures that impose restrictions on their use for an indefinite period. These
challenges are much greater than those encountered when managing analogue
collections.

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?

4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
Please refer to the UK Libraries and Archives Copyright Alliance’s submission.
We agree with the Alliance’s position that the Memorandum of Understanding is too
limited to enable cultural institutions to make their desired contribution to creativity,
innovation and cultural diversity in the digital age by making their collections available
online through mass-digitisation. A more comprehensive approach is needed (see our

          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
45
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
     YES – Please explain
Appropriate exceptions need to be developed in order to enable the mass digitisation of
copyright works in the collections of cultural organisations (such as enabling online
access to all types of works by registered users). These mechanisms need to reflect the
diverse nature of materials held in cultural organisations, not only covering the full
range of different types of works but also differentiating between works that were
created with commercial intent and those that were not. The interests of the public and
cultural organisations as well as those of rights holders must be represented in order to
find a workable solution that will enable mass-digitisation of copyright works for the
benefit of the public. Without appropriate mechanisms to enable mass-digitisation for
all types of content, a vast amount of materials will either be lost or shall never fulfil
their potential value as educational and cultural resources for the benefit of economy
and society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.




46
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                               28
42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain
The National Library of Wales works closely with members of the educational sector
(schools and higher/further education), raising awareness of the value of our collections
to education and research, and enabling their use in teaching. We also have an active
full-time Education Team based at the Library.
Both classroom and distance teaching methods have changed significantly as a result of
digital technologies and, while the aim of transferring knowledge in the most effective
way remains the same, copyright law has not been changed to facilitate the use of these
new methods. It has been found (in the course of the Hargreaves Review in the UK, for
example) that there is a generally low awareness of copyright among those who teach.
Where there is an understanding and a willingness to comply, the exceptions are very
restrictive and require a significant amount of additional work for the teacher. Due to
restrictions on time and/or uncertainty regarding what is permitted, works that are in
copyright may not be used at all, which has a detrimental effect on the quality of the
teaching and the teaching resources.
…………………………………………………………………………………………
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO



43.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
These problems would best be solved through a legislative solution supported by more
effective mechanisms to facilitate the use of content for illustration for teaching
purposes.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
There are currently mechanisms within the market place that aim to facilitate the use of
content for illustration for teaching purposes. These include subscription licences (which
are often restrictive), collective licensing (which create an administrative burden on
those who teach) and open content (which may not meet the quality expectations of the
teacher). The weaknesses of these mechanisms would be overcome by more robust
exceptions permitting the use of content for illustration for teaching purposes.

                                                                                           29
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
[Open question]
The exceptions that relate to teaching need to be revised at European level in order to
enable the easy use of copyright works when utilising new teaching methods. Article
5(3)(a) of Directive 2001/29/EC needs to be widened and it should be set as a minimum
requirement for all Member States. The relevant exceptions (or any other exceptions,
for that matter) should not be overridden or undermined by contract terms or
Technological Protection Measures.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain
The National Library of Wales works collaborates with research organisations and
communities to deliver projects and provide access to analogue and digital resources.
The current copyright framework, both on UK and EU levels, is stifling research. In
particular, Article 5(3)(a) of Directive 2001/29/EC only refers to ‘scientific research’,
while research is conducted across a much wider spectrum that this would suggest.

47
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                            30
There is also uncertainty regarding the distinction between ‘non-commercial’ and
‘commercial’ research.
Currently in the UK, libraries and archives can supply copies of literary, dramatic and
musical works for the purpose of private study or research for a non-commercial
purpose. This is expected to be extended in the coming months to include other types of
works (including artistic, audio-visual, sound recordings). The narrow nature of the
exception has created significant barriers to those engaged even in private study or
research for a non-commercial purpose (especially those who are not located within the
UK) due to the requirement either to travel in order to consult works in our collections
or undertake the necessary copyright clearances.
We also provide a service to researchers who undertake any clearance of third party
material included in their work. The costly (licence fees) and onerous nature of this
work can have a negative impact on the quality of research outputs, discouraging
researchers from demonstrating evidence that could be used to support their work. For
similar reasons, researchers may be discouraged from including third party materials in
presentations and papers given at conferences, seminars and similar events which are
key opportunities to share and discuss their work within and across research
communities.

  NO OPINION


48.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Barriers to research could be addressed in the first place by amending Article 3(a) of the
Directive to cover research other than ‘scientific’. Exceptions relating to research should
not be overridden or undermined by contract/licence terms or Technological Protection
Measures.

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
As an organisation that promotes and facilitates access of knowledge and information to
all, we believe that it is important that steps are taken to remove barriers that prevent or
restrict access to persons as a result of their disabilities. The ratification and
implementation by the EU and Member States of the WIPO Marrakesh Treaty would
be an important step towards removing these barriers and enhancing accessibility for
visually impaired persons. We would also add that exceptions and limitations to
copyright should also be extended to include persons with disabilities other than visual
impairment that may prevent or restrict their access to knowledge and information.

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to

publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

     YES – Please explain
The National Library of Wales supports changes to EU copyright rules that would
remove restrictions on text and data mining as methods of research. Through the use of
digital technologies, it is now possible to gather and analyse data in unprecedented ways.
Enabling the use of text and data mining to be employed without encountering copyright
(and/or database right) restrictions would have a positive impact on research leading to
economic and social benefits.

A limitation and exception for text and data mining would remove barriers to research.
If introduced, it is also important that measures are taken to prevent contracts from
overriding them and that rights holders should not be allowed to enforce Technological
Protection Measures to restrict access and use of data for these purposes.

An exception for text and data mining for non-commercial purposes is needed in order
to enable the use of these technologies for the benefit of research. To achieve the desired
impact, measures should be taken to prevent contracts and technological protection
measures from restricting data from being accessed and used under the exception.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.


53
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           35
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

The current exceptions and limitations to copyright do not provide sufficient leeway for

innovation and creative expression would be the introduction of exceptions that permit
creative uses such as remixes and mash-ups.

     IV.    Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
There is no need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private
copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment. The current exceptions
allow a degree of flexibility that is necessary to allow the adoption of new forms of
copying and reprography, resulting from technological advances.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59
         – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
We do not believe that digital copies made for private purposes should be subject to
private copying levies because the impact of this use on the copyright holder is minimal.
The copyright holder will have already had an opportunity to receive payment at the
point of licensing and the end user should not be required to make additional payments
for private use.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
Clarity is essential to the enabling sufficient and appropriate involvement of
intermediaries in inhibiting online copyright infringement. In the UK, the lack of clarity
in the Digital Economy Act and its relevant code has, among other things, created
uncertainty regarding the role of cultural organisations and universities in its
implementation (by treating them in the same way as internet service providers). Based
on their public policy functions, such organisations should not be regarded as
intermediaries and while they should be expected to take steps to prevent misuse of their
networks, their services should be protected from disruption caused measures to inhibit
online copyright infringement.
Intermediaries’ liability for copyright infringement should also be limited. Without
limitation, the possibility of legal or other punitive action against intermediaries because
of their users’ infringement of copyright could lead to steps and measures that would
have a detrimental impact on the provision of internet access and curb the freedom and
privacy of EU citizens.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
As noted in our response to Q.76, there is a concern that measures to inhibit online
copyright infringement will have a detrimental impact on the privacy and freedom of
consumers and that attempts to protect the right to have one’s copyright respected will
undermine the protection of private life and protection of personal data.
Ensuring the right balance in copyright law is essential to economic, social and cultural
development. The legal framework for copyright should aim to balance the interests of
right holders on the one hand, providing them with fair remuneration and an incentive
to continue to create, and of users on the other, enabling them to enjoy copyright works
and be inspired to develop their own ideas and create new works. The current copyright
framework fails to achieve this balance, especially within the digital environment. It is
seen as a mechanism used by copyright holders to control and restrict rather than a
framework that balances these interests in a way that will stimulate creativity and
innovation.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]
We agree that a unified Copyright Title would give consistency and facilitate the cross
border collaboration and use of copyright works. This will be a significant task and
unless it is given priority by the EU, rather than treated as a longer term project, it may
take decades to achieve.
