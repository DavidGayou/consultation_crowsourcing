RESPONSE TO THE COPYRIGHT CONSULTATION
The Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance1 (AAPA) represents companies involved in the provision
of protected audiovisual services, security technology for such services, and the
manufacturing of products which facilitate the delivery of such services. AAPA’s mission is to
enable the fight against piracy which involves the development, promotion, distribution,
application or use of technologies resulting in the unauthorised use of protected audiovisual
content, by co-ordinating intelligence and action supported by effective legislation and its
implementation.

Supplementing companies own activities, AAPA brings it members 2 together to share
information about piracy activities and to co-ordinate their actions, where appropriate.
Effective action requires appropriate and effective legislation, implemented consistently
across the EU in the first instance, supported by global co-ordination.

AAPA recognises that there is an inherent dichotomy in approach to EU legislation with the
aquis possibly being fit for purpose but with barriers to cross-border enforcement arising
from differences in Members State’s implementation of that legislation. This adds cost and
uncertainty to cross-border enforcement which creates opportunities for piracy. AAPA
would encourage the Commission to investigate how they could facilitate a more
harmonised approach to enforcement. As a minimum AAPA suggests that the dormant
Conditional Access Directive (CAD) Experts Group should be re-started with a focus on cross-
border enforcement issues. Indeed AAPA would also invite the Commission to consider how
the remit of the CAD Experts Group could be extended to embrace criminal law approaches
to enforcement also.

solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?


AAPA welcomes the acknowledgement that an adequate level of protection for rights
holders is a prerequisite for the cross-border availability of content (though it is not the only
requirement). In AAPA’s view the existing legal framework provides adequate protection.
However, difference approaches to and implementations of the law between Member
States (including the question which laws should be used in cases of audiovisual piracy and
what resources are available to enforcement agencies) affect the cross-border efficacy of
the EU aquis. This does not in itself deter rightsholders and broadcasters from making
content available on a cross-border basis but does make anti-piracy action less efficient than
it could be if a more harmonised approach existed.

75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

Views on this question vary. The reason for this variation appears to be attributable to the
manner in which the legislation is implemented – which can differ between Member States.
Subject to the introductory comments the legal system itself provides a robust basis to
ensure the protection of intellectual property rights.

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
Involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) In inhibiting online copyright
Infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?


The legal framework, as clarified by various ECJ judgments, is in itself clear. Implementation
of the law should, however, allow for expeditious identification on infringers and associated
enforcement action, while recognising the legitimate expectations, practicalities and cost
implications for intermediaries. It may be useful for the Commission to communicate
guidance of the cumulative effect of ECJ jurisprudence in this area.

As the Commission notes in the question “intermediaries” includes a number of different
types of service provider whose involvement in inhibiting online copyright infringements
undertaken for a commercial purpose would have differing impacts on counterfeiting and
piracy. Focussing tackling piracy and counterfeiting where commercial gain and organised
crime is involved should be the priority for any EU initiative. However, it is not clear what
form such an initiative could take. AAPA notes that the various attempts to develop MOUs
between different parties and more formal /legislative approaches such as Hadopi and the
UK Digital Economy Act have not cultivated a co-operative approach and it is difficult to
envisage how progress towards the common goal of fighting counterfeiting and piracy can
be achieved by a further attempt to create a MoU at EU level. AAPA suggests that any such
EU initiative should be limited in its scope and address infringement with a commercial
purpose and discernable commercial impact. In order to achieve progress, it may not be
appropriate to embrace all stakeholders in such initiatives.

AAPA would, however, encourage the Commission to look at ways in which once a
complaint is lodged with an enforcement agency swift action can be taken. AAPA’s
experience is that enforcement agencies and the judiciary can be slow to take forward
complaints, resulting an extended period of damage to rightsholders. This lack of speed can
also allow infringers to escape justice as in the online world migrating the infringing activity
from one server (e.g. the one identified in the complaint) to another is almost effortless.
AAPA recognises that the ability of enforcement agencies, etc., to progress a case will be
influenced by the priorities they face, as well as available resources. However, it is also clear
that a lack of understanding of the more technical aspects of piracy and the damage it
causes hinders prompt action. In this context AAPA would encourage the Commission to
work further with OHIM and Member States, involving private sector stakeholders also, to
develop a greater appreciation of the need for swift action amongst enforcement bodies
and a greater understanding of what counterfeiting and piracy entails amongst the judiciary.

AAPA would be please to support this work and, indeed, is already engaged in this activity
(holding two workshops at the Interpol IP Crime Enforcement conference and working with
OHIM and Europol on the forthcoming know-how session on sports).

77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?


YES The current system, as interpreted by the ECJ (see for example case C-360/10 – SABAM
vs. Netlog and case C-70/10 SABAM vs. BEA and ISPA) strikes the right balance. However, it
is indisputable that there has to be a trade-off between privacy and data protection and the
interests of rightsholders if effective and efficient action against IP infringement is to occur.
