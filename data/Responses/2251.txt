   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

€ NO


€ NO OPINION


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)




Hyperlinking should  not  be  subject  to  copyright  protection  under  any
circumstances. Sharing links is one of the core elements  of  the  Internet.
Making hyperlinks subject to copyright protection would  change  the  entire
way the Internet operates. It would also have a detrimental  effect  on  the
free flow of information and commerce online, while also limiting access  to
e-content. Additionally, it would prevent the activities of services,  which
provide access to cultural  heritage,  such  as  The  European  Library  and
Europeana. These  services  are  based  on  linking  metadata  of  e-content
providers from various European countries.

The creator of a hyperlink must  be  free  to  link  to  publicly  available
resources without having to worry about infringing copyright. This needs  to
be the case regardless of the legal status of the  linked  work  or  of  the
intent of the right holder who has published such a work (or authorized  the
publication).

This position has also been confirmed in a recent judgment of the  Court  of
Justice, Case C-466/12.


  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)

No. As in the case  of  hyperlinking,  this  would  cause  a  limitation  on
actions allowed on the Internet, and would go against  the  core  principles
of Internet. Temporary copies are necessary in order to efficiently  deliver
content to a user. Such fleeting reproductions (such as copies in the  cache
memory) should be seen as outside the scope of copyright protection.

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the

      market (type of content) concerned.

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]

A registration system in the EU would benefit both authors  (right  holders)
as well as the users of copyrighted works. The information  on  who  is  the
right holder in a certain work would be freely and easily accessible,  which
means that any infringements upon copyrights could be minimized. This  could
also be beneficial in the case of  orphaned  works.  A  registration  system
would align with the overall objectives of EU copyright policy--that is,  to
“support creation and innovation, tap  the  full  potential  of  the  Single
Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy  and  promote  cultural
diversity.”

For full benefits of such a system, registration should  be  a  precondition
for a full exercise of rights, and specifically to  be  granted  protection,
such as the ability to start enforcement action.

Such a system would be similar to the one in place in the United States  and
as such would not be in conflict with the principle  of  no  formalities  of
access to protection as currently provided by the Berne Convention  for  the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.

This would also help mitigate the problem of future orphan works,  as  there
will be a formal registry of rights holders (however, a registration  system
will not be able to retroactively  solve  the  existing  problems  faced  by
cultural heritage  institutions  with  regards  to  orphan  works  and  mass
digitisation).

On the more general level a registration system would  decrease  transaction
costs and improve the availability  of  rights  information  to  all  market
participants.
To be useful such a system needs to also record rights transfers  throughout
the duration of  the  copyright  protection  of  the  registered  works.  In
addition a registration system must be transparent and easy to use, so  that
it allows all types of rights holders  (including  individual  creators)  to
register their works. The system should also include  information  on  works
that are out of copyright as a means to provide legal clarity for  users  of
Public Domain works.

Moreover, a registration system could provide  a  more  efficient  mechanism
for commercial licensing opportunities. Such  a  registration  system  could
integrate  a  variety  of  rights  information--such  as   indicating   open
licensing for authors that wish to  distribute  their  works  broadly  under
liberal terms--or including information on works  that  are  in  the  public
domain. In general, a registration system will help reduce  the  transaction
costs between rights holders  and  potential  users.  In  addition,  if  the
registration system were developed using  open  standards  and  formats,  it
would provide a rich set of rights information as open data to  be  used  in
third party applications and services.




  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


Overall, a registration  system  would  be  the  most  beneficial  for  both
authors as well as users of copyrighted  works,  however  there  are  a  few
disadvantages of such a system. The first and  main  issue  is  a  financial
one. A development of a registry would  require  a  significant  investment,
however the benefits of such a system would by far outweigh the costs.

The second issue is the sheer mass and speed of  production  of  copyrighted
works in today’s digital environment. Since it is very easy  to  create  and
share a vast amount of copyrighted works, the authors might not be  inclined
to register every single work they create, due to the sheer  mass  of  those
works. The aversion to registration could also be due to the fact that  some
authors might not be interested in copyright protection (or at least do  not
care for  copyright  protection  that  lasts  for  100+  years).  So,  these
creators may not care to register  their  works,  or  may  be  selective  in
registering their works.  This  could  also  be  positive,  since  with  the
increased threshold for certain types of  protection,  this  would  decrease
the number of potential copyright actions  because  only  those  works  that
authors truly wish to protect would be registered.

The last issue is the possibility  of  abuse;  there  would  be  no  way  to
determine if the applicant is in fact  the  holder  of  copyrights  or  not,
which could lead to false information in  the  registry.  Additionally,  the
system might not be up to date on older works, since authors  might  not  be
interested in registering them.




  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]

As proposed above, certain copyright protection could  only  be  granted  to
rights holders who have registered their  works.  In  principle  this  could
apply to any element of copyright protection that is  not  required  by  the
Berne convention.

For example, registration might be required for a rights holder to start  an
enforcement actions (such as notice and takedown), or would be  required  to
access a  particular  type  or  level  of  damage  awards  in  a  successful
infringement judgment. This could also be applied to the ability to  collect
royalties  through  collective   rights   management   organizations.   This
requirement would justify the need  for  active  cooperation  of  collective
societies as outlined above.

In addition  registration  could  be  made  a  prerequisite  for  prolonging
copyright  protection  beyond  the  minimum  term  required  by  the   Berne
convention.

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]

The European Union should ensure two things:  (1)  identifiers  as  well  as
rights  ownership  and  permission  databases  should  be  based   on   open
standards, available to all content creators and able  to  be  read  by  all
market participants free of charge; and  (2)  all  identifiers  as  well  as
rights ownership and permission databases are interoperable  across  all  of
Europe (and beyond).

Any system that is developed must be developed in a true  multi  stakeholder
approach (e.g not only by rights holders and intermediaries) and  should  be
reflective of work already undertaken (for  example  by  Europeana).  Rights
ownership  and  permission  databases  in  particular   must   be   publicly
accessible via machine readable  interfaces.  They  must  also  include  the
ability to store information on out-of-copyright (Public Domain) works.

While it is necessary to  find  ways  to  encourage,  and  possibly  impose,
registration and consequently the use of identifiers, it is  also  important
that the field is left open to innovation and the introduction of  solutions
that better suit different markets or sections thereof. Top down  approaches
supporting or privileging one solution against  another  or  precluding  new
solutions to be introduced in the future will have a negative effect  as  it
will reduce innovation.

Any identifier that also keeps track of rights holders, should be  kept  up-
to-date in this respect and also register subsequent  rights  holders  to  a
work

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

The term of copyright protection should be shortened. The  excessive  length
of copyright protection combined with an absence of  formalities  is  highly
detrimental to the accessibility of our shared knowledge and culture.

The current term of copyright  does  not  provide  for  a  suitable  balance
between the protection of rights of the author and encouragement for him  to
produce new works and the need of the general public to access  as  well  as
use works. The access is hampered  by  the  fact  that  in  many  cases  the
authors have died a long time ago. Furthermore, there is  no  evidence  that
the  current  copyright  protection  term  encourages  the   production   of
copyright-protected works.

The current term of protection of life of author plus  70  years  stands  in
stark contrast with the commercial life of the large majority  of  copyright
protected works. As  a  result  the  disproportionate  length  of  copyright
protection prevents the majority of institutions,  which  use  and  digitize
copyrighted works from effectively fulfilling their mission in  the  digital
environment. It is also important to note that many institution  hold  large
collections of works that are  still  under  copyright  (or  for  which  the
copyright status  is  unclear)  but  that  are  not  exploited  commercially
anymore.  As  a  result,  these  works  become  ‘dead’,  useless  for   both
commercial and cultural, educational purposes. In many cases the  costs  for
digitisation of copyrighted works that are no longer commercially  exploited
exceeds the potential economic value of these works. As a result  these  are
not made available online by  the  rights  holders  (who  lack  an  economic
incentive and a viable business model). Many institutions, which  have  such
works in their collections have an incentive to make  such  works  available
(their public mission to provide access to their collections and to  support
education and culture), however they are confronted with  costs  for  rights
clearance that increase the costs for  making  these  collections  available
without providing any effective economic benefits to rights holders.

Shortening the term of protection will decrease the  number  of  works  that
are in copyright but out of commercial exploitation. Given this the term  of
protection should be reduced to the minimum requirement established  by  the
Berne Convention (life of the creator(s) plus  50  years.  In  addition  the
European Union should work to further reduce the term. This  should  include
efforts to agree on a system where extended copyright  protection  after  an
initial automatically granted term would  be  only  granted  if  the  rights
holder registers the work. The authors who have not registered their  rights
would only be entitled to moral rights protection.

 The duration of the initial term should  be  brought  into  line  with  the
duration of protection of other IP rights such as  patented  inventions  (20
years) databases (15 years) and industrial design rights (25  years).  Given
this 20 years appears to be a reasonable initial  term  of  protection  that
should guarantee  protection  to  the  vast  majority  of  protected  works.
Protection for works that are actively exploited  by  their  rights  holders
after such an initial period can be extended by registering such works.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

The fact that limitations and exceptions in the EU are optional  for  Member
States  promotes   legal   uncertainty   and   creates   problems.   Similar
organizations and citizens should be able to enjoy the  same  exceptions  in
all member states.

Exceptions and limitations in the copyright directives should be  harmonized
among the Member States and raised to the highest standard.  Currently,  the
list of  possible  exceptions  and  limitations  that  a  Member  State  can
implement is closed and limited. This is  an  obstacle  in  today’s  digital
environment and is not in keeping  with  the  rapid  pace  of  technological
innovation that shapes how we interact with copyright protected works.  This
not only limits the abilities of citizens  to  gain  access  to  our  shared
culture and knowledge, but also imposes restrictions on innovative  business
models--and as a result economic growth. In the  absence  of  an  open-ended
exception such as a fair use clause, it is imperative  that  exceptions  and
limitations can be adjusted to the needs  of  society  at  large,  and  with
innovative economic actors in particular. The main solution  to  this  issue
is introduction of greater flexibility in copyright law.

  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

All  existing  and   any   additional   exception   should   be   mandatory.
Additionally, the level of harmonization should be higher, they need  to  be
harmonized to the  fullest  extent  possible.  It  is  not  acceptable  that
citizens in some Member States  enjoy  a  lesser  level  of  access  to  the
collections held by publicly funded cultural  heritage  institutions  simply
because of an uneven implementation of exceptions  and  limitations  of  the
InfoSoc Directive. This issue is more pressing as more and  more  activities
of cultural heritage institutions are taking place online.

All exceptions provided for in the EU copyright directives  are  subject  to
the same  general  terms:  that  they  do  not  interfere  with  the  normal
exploitation of the work  and,  therefore,  do  not  unreasonably  prejudice
rights holders. Since this is taken into  consideration  when  drafting  the
exceptions, it means that making the exceptions  mandatory  should  have  no
negative  effect  on  rights  holders,  while  in  many  cases   this   will
substantially benefit citizens and other public policy  objectives  such  as
access to knowledge and culture or inclusive education.

Technical Protection Measures also cause huge concern.  The  formulation  of
exceptions  must  allow  for  the  circumvention  of  Technical   Protection
Measures for them to  be  effectively  utilized.  This  should  be  possible
regardless of any contractual obligations providing otherwise.

  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]

Yes, a new exception should be added that allow  non-commercial  sharing  of
protected works and the creation of  transformative  works  by  individuals.
Also, the status of e-lending  should  be  clarified,  possibly  via  a  new
exception.  In  addition  cultural  heritage   institutions   and   research
institutions  need  to  be  enabled  to  make  works  in  their  collections
available online for non-commercial purposes. As outlined in the  answer  to
question 34 this does not require a new exception but  can  be  achieved  by
expanding the scope of the  existing  provision  in  article  5(3)n  of  the
directive.

Finally there is a need to introduce an open ended norm that  increases  the
flexibility  of  the  current  system  of  targeted  exceptions   (see  next
question).
Text and data mining exception for research and scientific  purposes  should
be introduced.



  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why

There is a general need for more flexibility in the EU regulatory  framework
for limitations and  exceptions.  This  is  in  part  due  to  technological
innovation, which has already occurred, and can be expected to lead  to  new
forms of use in the near future. It would be  wise  to  create  a  copyright
framework that is flexible enough to deal with such developments.


A greater degree of flexibility is also desirable from  the  perspective  of
cultural heritage institutions, as it would allow them to embrace  new  ways
of making their collections  available  without  the  need  for  legislative
reform. Compared to institutions in countries  that  have  a  more  flexible
approach  to  exceptions  and  limitations,  European  institutions  face  a
competitive disadvantage. Compare for example the scope of the Google  books
project in the United States and  in  Europe:  in  Europe,  Google  and  the
libraries are only digitising out-of-copyright works, while in the U.S.  the
project also includes in-copyright titles. As  a  result,  citizens  of  the
U.S. have  better  access  to  their  recent  (20th  century)  culture  than
European citizens. More generally users all over world  have  better  access
to US culture than to European culture.

  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]

The best approach would be an open norm in the vain of a fair use  provision
in the US,  which  would  allow  maximum  flexibility,  while  also  keeping
existing specific exceptions and  limitations.  This  open  norm  should  be
harmonized across the entire EU, which would mean that  the  impact  on  the
functioning of the single market would be minimal.

It would of course have to be  interpreted  by  the  Commission  to  prevent
different interpretations by the  national  courts.  The  unification  would
benefit the Internal Market,  making  it  more  open,  while  also  removing
uncertainty with users of copyrighted works, regardless of  the  state  that
they are operating in.

  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to

One of the main  problems  of  limitations  and  exceptions  in  the  EU  is
precisely their territoriality. It is confusing to end-users  when  one  use
is covered by an exception to copyright in one  jurisdiction  but  the  same
use is prohibited in another country. This is  further  complicated  by  the
fact that individual Member States may choose  which  exceptions  they  will
adopt as national law, instead of them being compulsory. This  also  enables
a  situation  where  countries  have  vastly  different  legislations.   The
European free market should be harmonized in  this  area,  to  enable  legal
certainty and thus make it possible for users of copyrighted  works  to  use
them under the same conditions in different countries of the EU.

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[41] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[42].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[43].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.


  28. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
      preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your
      collection?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

€ YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and  the  type  of  use  in
question.

The following answers apply to all cultural heritage  institutions  as  well
as to research institutions and not only to libraries and archives.

Institutions increasingly digitize works in their collections  not  only  to
prevent harm, but also to be able to better fulfill their  missions.  It  is
crucial for cultural heritage institutions to  be  able  to  digitize  their
collections regardless  of  the  work’s  copyright  status.  Digital  copies
enable easier access to works. Digital copies  of  cultural  heritage  works
provide many advantages such  as  being  (automatically)  searchable,  being
easier to access and having  lower  storage  costs.  However,  none  of  the
national implementations allow  for  structural  digitization.  In  addition
recital 40 of the Directive, which states, “Such an exception or  limitation
should not cover uses made in the context of online  delivery  of  protected
works  or  other  subject-matter”   is   highly   problematic.   As   online
dissemination  of  works  becomes  more  and  more  important  for  cultural
heritage institutions, limiting the reproduction exception in such a way  is
simply anachronistic as it prevents institutions from using digitized  works
in a meaningful way.

Technical measures are another cause for concern. CDs  and  DVDs  are  often
protected by technological measures, the removal of which would require  the
cooperation of the producer. Art. 6 of the InfoSoc Directive  provides  that
technological protection measures are protected, independently of the  scope
of  protection,  entrusting  to  voluntary  agreements  or   to   subsidiary
interventions of Member States  the  adoption  of  appropriate  measures  to
ensure that legitimate users can make effective  use  of  licensed  content.
The strength of the protection of TPMs compared with  the  weakness  of  the
provision in favor of legitimate uses has in many Member States led  to  the
absence  of  any  effective  guarantee  for  legitimate   users,   including
libraries. As a result, many libraries are not able  to  reproduce  CDs  and
DVDs they’ve legally acquired.

29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

The problems could  be  solved  by  broadening  the  existing  exception  in
article 5(2)c of the Copyright Directive so that it allows  institutions  to

[Open question]
As stated in the answer to the previous  question,  the  problems  could  be
solved by  broadening  the  existing  exception  in  article  5(2)c  of  the
Copyright Directive so that it allows institutions to make reproductions  of
all works in their collection as long as these are not intended  for  direct
commercial advantage. This exception should be broad  enough  to  allow  all
acts  of  reproduction  necessary   for   publicly   accessible   libraries,
educational establishments or  museums,  or  by  archives  to  achieve  aims
related   to   their   public-interest   missions.   This   should   include
reproductions made as part of mass digitization efforts, backup  copies  and
reproductions for format shifting. To  ensure  the  protection  of  authors,
reproductions should be limited to internal use, which  is  not  for  direct
commercial or economic advantage. Reproductions would explicitly be  allowed
for the purposes of  increasing  the  operational  efficiency  and  reducing
costs of the beneficiary institutions. The “specific acts  of  reproduction”
undertaken by heritage institutions should be better defined and  its  exact
scope determined: Restoration– replacement –preservation of fragile works  –
format-shifting – copying for archiving, including web harvesting –  copying
and supplying upon request.

Additionally, Art. 6 of the InfoSoc directive should be revised in order  to
enforce exceptions and limitations and to ensure legitimate utilizations  of
protected works, regardless of format or mode of dissemination.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

The following answers apply to all cultural heritage  institutions  as  well
as to research institutions and not only to libraries and archives.

Experiences with negotiations with rights  holders  differ.  Rights  holders
(authors) are mostly interested in having  their  works  published/available
to the public at no cost for them. However, a lot of the time libraries  are
subject to complex and lengthy negotiations  with  publishers  and  database
vendors, which  impact  collection  development,  duration  of  access,  and
permitted uses.  Negotiation  with  publishers  is  an  expensive  and  time
consuming process and most licenses are  presented  as  final,  without  the
ability to negotiate on  terms,  which  are  often  taken  over  from  other
jurisdictions.



(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?

Users encounter issues with accessing content when not on  the  premises  of
the institutions. This is due to the fact  that  most  institutions  provide
for the consultation  of  works  and  other  subject  matter  via  dedicated
terminals on  the  premises  of  such  establishments  for  the  purpose  of
research and private study comes closest to a mechanism  that  could  enable
such uses, which is in keeping with the provided exception.  Because  online
access does not fall within the scope of  the  exception  institutions  must
negotiate with right holders, thus making the process and access to  content
more limited.




(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]




  33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]
The best solution would be to broaden  the  existing  exception  in  article
5(3)n of the Copyright Directive so that  it  allows  institutions  to  make
available digital copies of out-of-commerce works in their  collections  via
electronic networks such as the internet for non commercial  purposes.  This
would enable the digitised works to  be  accessible  to  people  who  cannot
travel to the premises (ex. due to their disabilities). This would  also  be
in keeping with the progress of  technology  and  the  expectations  of  the
general  public,  which  expects  works  to  be  accessible  remotely.  This
exception should be implemented in the same manner in all Member States.



  34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]
The main element would be a broadening of the existing exception in  article
5(3)n of the Copyright Directive. Instead of limiting the  making  available
to dedicated terminals on the premises of the institutions, it  should  also
apply to making the works available online via public networks such  as  the
Internet. The scope of the exception should further be expanded to not  only
include ‘the purpose of research or private study’  by  ‘individual  members
of the public’ but should apply to all non commercial uses.

Furthermore, It seems reasonable to limit the  scope  of  the  exception  to
‘works and other subject-matter not subject to purchase or licensing  terms’
as long as they are still commercially available. This  should  be  combined
with an opt out-clause that would allow rights  holders  to  either  prevent
the making available of their works or to  negotiate  licensing  terms  with
the institutions (either on an individual basis or collectively).

This would also ensure that the exception  meets  the  requirements  of  the
Berne three-step test. Limiting the  scope  of  the  exception  to  publicly
accessible cultural heritage institutions and to out-of-commerce  works  and
works that are not subject to licensing terms should  satisfy  the  'certain
special cases' criteria and cannot, by definition, be in conflict  with  the
'normal exploitation' of the work in question. The fact that  the  exception
would be limited to non commercial uses of  the  works  made  available  and
that authors can decide to opt-out of the  exception  would  further  ensure
that  'the  legitimate  interests  of  the  author'  are   not   necessarily
prejudiced.

In fact, many authors would benefit from improving online access to  out-of-
commerce works because works that they have created are kept  available  via
cultural heritage institutions (and are available to them to build  upon  or
to do research). As a result, citizens also  greatly  benefit  because  they
are granted access to  works  that  wouldn't  be  available  through  market
players.

Additionally, it would be beneficial to also allow making  available  online
via closed networks, for non-commercial purposes.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection?

Libraries have faced a number  of  problems  when  attempting  to  negotiate
agreements to facilitate electronic lending. These include:


    • Denial of sales of electronic books to libraries by publishers;
    • Removal of content that was available for e-lending without  informing
      the library;
    • The use of multiple licences  and  different  models  create  lack  of
      clarity on the condition of access to the content for users;
    • A deterioration of registered users’ rights (crossing a border with  a
      borrowed book was not a  problem.  Transborder  online  access  to  an
      electronic copy offered by a library is often impossible as the result
      of restrictive licensing conditions.


More generally the question is if it is necessary  to  negotiate  agreements
to  enable  electronic  lending.  Contrary  to  what  is   stated   in   the
introduction to this question there is considerable  uncertainty  about  the
status of e-lending under EU law.



(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

  37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
The best solution for the problem would be  to  create  legal  certainty  by
unambiguously including the right to e-lending in the EU. While the  lending
of analogue works is currently  being  enabled  by  directive  2006/115,  e-
lending, which is most often considered as an act  of  making  available  to
the public,  would  probably  need  to  be  regulated  via  an  (additional)
mandatory exception in the InfoSoc directive. Such  a  new  exception  could
take the form of a statutory license with fair compensation for authors.

Since e-lending must be available for all books (commercially  available  or
not) it should be treated separately from the general exception  for  making
out-of-commerce works available online that we  argue  for  in  response  to
question 34.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

  38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences  do
      you  see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,
      including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you
      encountered?

[Open question]
There are vast differences between the management  of  physical  and  online
collections. While  users  can  access  physical  collections  only  at  the
premises of the institutions, online collections enable access to the  works
from  anywhere  and  at  anytime.  Online   collections   can   also   offer
simultaneous access to more people than physical collections.

Most problems are caused with online collections due  to  copyrights,  which
do not  provide  for  such  activity  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  Cultural
heritage institutions have to rely on the permission of  rights  holders  to
make them available online, which is often difficult to obtain. As  we  have
argued above, this makes no sense in situations where the majority of  works
held by these institutions are not even commercially available.

With the increasing digitisation of our society  (and  media  production  in
particular), this has other,  potentially  far  reaching  consequences.  For
example, library can buy all physical publications to ensure that  they  are
available  to  the  public  both  during  the  period  of  their  commercial
availability and thereafter.

The same is not true for digital publications, which  are  not  being  sold,
but  licensed.  And  currently  libraries  cannot  buy   licences   to   all
commercially available content because rights holders  are  free  to  decide
whether they want to give access to  a  specific  work  (and  who  also  can
decide on the  terms  for  such  access).  Often  such  conditions  make  it
impossible to keep such works indefinitely or to make them available to  the
community by lending them out. The consequence of this is that  the  content
collection policies of libraries are increasingly determined  by  publishers
and not by the institutions themselves. In the long  run,  this  development
threatens to undermine the core function of cultural  heritage  institutions
to preserve the knowledge and culture  of  our  societies  and  to  keep  it
available to the public.

  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[44].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[45].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?


€ YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain

From the perspective of cultural heritage institutions  this  question  (and
the following) are too limited.  The  issue  of  mass  digitisation  is  far
broader than what can be addressed with the 2011 MoU  and  the  2012  Orphan
works directive (the other  relevant  European  policy  instrument  in  this
area). Copyright issues related to the mass digitisation of collections  and
the subsequent making available of digitised works require  a  comprehensive
approach that cannot be based the principles of  due  diligence  search  and
licensing. If we want to enable European cultural heritage  institutions  to
transfer their collections into the digital age (and  there  cannot  be  any
doubt that this is both an  important  policy  objective  and  a  reasonable
expectation of users who as taxpayers fund these organisations)  we  need  a
far more comprehensive approach.


In the questions above  we  have  outlined  such  an  approach.  That  would
provide  cultural  heritage  institutions  a  clear  legal   framework   for
operating in the digital environment that would allow us to to  achieve  the
aims related to  our  public-interest  missions.  Under  this  approach  the
online activities of cultural heritage  institutions  would  be  covered  by
three targeted exceptions:


    • An exception covering the making of reproductions (an expanded version
      of the current exception defined in 5(2)c)
    • An exception covering the making available of out-of-commerce works an
      expanded version of the current exception defined in 5(3)n)
    • A new exception covering e-lending

  41. Would it be necessary to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
      agreed for other types of content (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
      collections, broadcasters’ archives)?


€ YES – Please explain

This is certainly necessary. The public has a legitimate interest in  having
online access to the  collections  of  all  publicly  accessible  libraries,
museums, and archives across Europe  (see  article  27.1  of  the  Universal
Declaration  of  Human  Rights).  There  is  no  good  reason  for  limiting
mechanisms that create such access to certain types of content.


This solution would also be in line with the  relevant  recommendation  made
in the 'New Renaissance' report  of  the  Commission  appointed  'Comite  de
Sages' that was published in 2011. The report  recommended  that  'solutions
for orphan works and out of distribution works must cover all the  different
sectors: audiovisual, text, visual arts, sound'.

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain

The educational exception as defined by the Copyright  Directive  is  broad,
however the problem is that none of the Member States have  implemented  the
exception as broadly as allowed by the Copyright Directive. This means  that
the permitted use of works for illustration  for  teaching  differs  between
Member States.  This  creates  problems  for  providers  of  various  online
courses, which could be publicly accessed from different Member  States.  In
some Member States  the  problem  is  also  the  out  dated  formulation  of
exception, which does not cover the uses of online works.

Very often copyrighted materials are used in  massive  open  online  courses
(or MOOCs) that are administered by consortia  of  educational  institutions
established in several Member States and accessible to all EU  citizens.  In
this case, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, there  is  a  clear  need
for harmonization as Member States provide different exceptions for  use  of
digital files for teaching purposes.

There are not only  problems  with  disharmonized  exceptions  for  teaching
purposes but also  the  question  of  applicable  law.  It  is  for  example
uncertain which Member State laws would be applicable to the act  of  making
available digital works online. Different factors could be  considered  such
as the country of establishment, the place  of  upload  or  the  country  to
which the online activity is directed. In the case  of  MOOCs  conducted  by
educational institutions based in several Member States it  is  never  fully
possible to determine, which law applies.

There are also issues with using copyrighted materials in  textbooks.  While
most countries do provide for an exception for use of copyrighted  materials
in textbooks, these once again do not follow the technological progress.  It
is in the interest of student to have  access  to  textbooks  in  a  digital
form, which means that not only does an exception for reproduction  need  to
be in place, the act of making  available  to  the  public  should  also  be
allowed.

Finally there are also the issues  of  finding  the  right  balance  between
technical protection measures and exceptions and  limitations  to  copyright
regime. It is true in education as well  as  in  any  other  area  to  which
exceptions and limitations apply  that  technical  protection  measures  and
restrictive licensing prohibit permitted uses.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION


  43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]
The solution to the above mentioned problems would be a mandatory  exception
for illustration for teaching purposes for all Member States.  The  European
legislator should also clearly define its specific  scope  thus  leaving  no
room  for  narrow  interpretations   and   implementations   into   national
legislations.

We have also encountered problems  with  education  of  potential  users  of
exception about the scope of the exception as currently  used  in  Slovenia.
For example there is a clear lack of knowledge of academia teachers  on  the
issue of the potential use of exception for teaching  purposes.  Very  often
they do not use interactive material such  as  movies  and  songs  in  their
lectures as they are afraid of legal consequences of right holders in  these
material. This is also the case when the use is obviously permissible  under
the teaching exception. It is not surprising therefore that there is  little
knowledge and  understanding  of  the  teaching  exception  even  among  its
beneficiaries. As a result of different harmonization of teaching  exception
and in the case of  online  multi-territorial  activities  (e-learning)  the
uncertainty is even higher.

With regards to the question of textbooks, there should be an  exception  in
place, which would allow for  both  the  acts  of  reproduction  and  making
available.  This  should  be  an  exception  without  the   obligation   for
remuneration if textbooks are made available to final user free of charge.





  44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to  facilitate  the  use  of
      content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
      they?

[Open question]
There are some mechanisms like extended collective licensing  or  agreements
with publishers on the national level. These  solutions  are  however  risky
for  the  educational  establishments  as  there  is  no  guarantee  that  a
beneficiary  agreement  will  be  reached   with   collecting   society   or
publishers. The proposed mechanisms also do not help to  harmonize  teaching
exception across  EU.  Moreover  such  agreements  could  be  also  counter-
effective and unfair as educational establishments  may  seek  licenses  for
uses which are already covered by the existing exception.

Most established systems are nor adapted to the new technology and are  only
suit to service print text books and teaching in non-digital form.


  45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under what conditions?

[Open question]
A solution on the EU level  is  indeed  needed.  As  proposed  by  some  the
solution could be also in the form of a regulation rather than a  directive.
The currently broad and open teaching exception should not be lost.

First of all, the mandatory exception should cover all types of use  of  all
types of works for all kind of beneficiaries, which  carry  out  educational
activities. It should not be  limited  to  any  types  of  institutions  but
rather defined by its purpose: teaching.  Therefore  it  should  not  matter
whether educational establishment is financed by public or private funds  as
long as the purpose of educational activity is  non-commercial.  The  notion
of “teaching” is not defined in the Copyright Directive. In its  recital  14
it refers to education as well:  “this  Directive  should  seek  to  promote
learning and culture by protecting  works  and  other  subject-matter  while
permitting exceptions or limitations in the public interest for the  purpose
of education and teaching”. Also, article 5(3)a does not limit  the  use  of
works for illustration for teaching and education to  excerpts  only,  while
most of the MS do so.

Secondly, the exception should allow for use of any copyrighted material  in
any kind  of  media  including  text,  film,  music,  multimedia,  etc.  for
illustration of teaching in classrooms as  well  as  distance  learning  (e-
learning). Also use of copyrighted works in teaching  compilations,  whether
analogue or digital, should be allowed.

Thirdly, we  recommend  no  licenses  or  compensation  model.  The  use  of
material for  teaching  purposes  should  not  require  the  consent  of  or
remuneration of right holders except in the case  where  the  exempted  uses
concern works made available for e-learning purposes and  fair  compensation
is needed in order to satisfy the three-step test (for  example  in  MOOCs).
In this case the levies should  be  paid  by  the  educational  institutions
located in the country where the  uploading  of  the  educational  materials
take place.

If the teaching exception remains non-mandatory as it is now,  we  recommend
to  clearly  define  the  law   governing   multi   territorial   e-learning
activities. It would be appropriate to point to the law governing the  right
to make works available to the public,  which  in  turn  should  be  defined
following the Satellite and Cable  Directive  approach  of  the  country  of
origin principle. In the case of making  available  right,  the  country  of
origin should be the country where the act of uploading takes place  (as  in
the case of broadcasts it is the country of the uplink of a broadcast  to  a
satellite).

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

  47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research
      projects/activities, including across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

€ YES – Please explain

Yes. Modern research is conducted in the digital  environment  and  as  such
there is by definition an international cross-border dimension.  Researchers
exchange scientific papers and materials online,  they  use  text  and  data
mining tools in order to extract specific knowledge from large datasets.

Research is covered by  the  same  exception  as  teaching.  However,  these
activities are significantly different.  Researchers  use  works  and  other
subject matter by way of illustration, as the teaching  exception  requires.
But in the digital  environment,  researchers  also  extract  excerpts  from
them, incorporate extracts of data into their tools  for  data  mining,  and
conduct virtual experiments and other forms of digital manipulation.

As the exception covers only non-commercial  research,  problems  can  arise
when there are questions about  whether  the  research  conducted  could  be
interpreted as being of a commercial  nature.  For  example,  does  publicly
funded research carried out by a private company, for instance a  member  of
an FP7 project, qualify for the exception?  Does  research  conducted  by  a
university leading to a patent application fall under the exception?

  48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]
Apart from a legislative solution as outlined  below,  the  access  problems
could be solved by implementing open access principles.  As  recommended  by
the Commission (Recommendation of the European Commission on access  to  and
preservation of the scientific information, 17th July 2012), the results  of
 publicly funded research  projects  should  be  published  in  open  access
models. The Commission should further  promote  and  encourage  open  access
models such as in the Horizon 2020 research framework  program  and  beyond.
There is also a need to promote data awareness  and  a  culture  of  sharing
among researchers and publishers. It may be done by establishing  mechanisms
and processes to recognize, reward, and  possibly  even  require  good  data
sharing practices.

In terms of a  legislative  solution,  it  is  recommended  to  introduce  a
separate exception for research. The exception should be made mandatory  and
its scope clarified. The current provision leads to  legal  uncertainty  and
abuse by rights holders. It should remain functional in its nature, i.e.  it
should not extend  to  particular  beneficiaries,  but  be  defined  by  its
purpose: conducting research. It should extend to works, the subject  matter
of related rights, computer programs, and databases. The  uses  allowed  for
research should not be limited by way of illustration, and  should  cover  a
wide range of  uses  in  order  to  enable  unrestricted  digital  research.
Scientists must be free to subject any article published or  made  available
online  to  data  mining,  extractions,   variations,   or   other   digital
manipulations provided they give  proper  attribution  under  the  norms  of
scholarly research. The exception should cover commercial or  non-commercial
activities. If necessary for political reasons, the uses for the purpose  of
commercial research (guidelines on  the  meaning  of  commercial  should  be
provided) could be subject to fair compensation, but the  levies  should  be
low and well-administered.

As this is the case for all limitations and exceptions, the  legal  measures
must be taken in order to prevent contractual  overrides  and  technological
protection measures blocking of permitted research uses.

The above legislative approach stressing the need for a broad exception  for
scientific research has been proposed and substantiated by  the  Max  Planck
Institute  for  Intellectual  Property,  Competition  and  Tax  Law  in  its
response  to  the  Green  Paper:  Copyright   in   the   Knowledge   Economy
consultations in 2008, and further defined and supported  by  Reichmann  and
Okediji in Empowering the  Digitally  Integrated  Scientific  Research,  the
Pivotal Role of Copyrights’ Exceptions and Limitations,  2009.  That  latter
paper was presented to the Commission during the consultations of the  Green
Paper.

  49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate  the  use  of
      content for research purposes? How successful are they?

[Open question]
Some member states use extended collective  licensing  mechanisms  to  cover
research activities. Publishers offer individual licenses to allow for  text
and data mining. These solutions are not optimal  since  they  offer  better
solutions  to  richer  institutions,  which  in  turn  are   not   necessary
performing better research.

There are open access principles promoted and implemented  on  the  European
level. However, as  noted  above  in  Question  48,  there  is  a  need  for
formulating policies that would encourage  implementations  of  open  access
and sharing of knowledge.

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [49].

The Marrakesh Treaty[50] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?



(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[51] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[52].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when
      trying to use text or data mining methods, including across borders?

We have identified that intellectual property regime, as currently  in  use,
is an obstacle to TDM activities in the EU.


The reason is that there is no clear exception  in  the  EU  copyright  law,
which would allow research and  educational  institutions  to  undertake TDM
without clearing the necessary copyrights of  authors  of  texts  and  data,
which  are being   mined.   There   is   also   no   exception   for   other
rights e.g. sui generis database  rights  of  publishers.  In  Slovenia  for
example limitations on copyright such as  "private  reproduction  exception"
must fulfill certain criteria,  the  biggest  challenge  being  the  general
provision  enacted  in Article  46  of  Slovenian   Copyright   Act,   which
stipulates that:

"Limitations on  copyright  are  permissible  in  cases  mentioned  in  this
Section, provided that the extent of such exploitation  of  copyright  works
is limited by the intended purpose, is compatible with fair  practice,  does
not   conflict   with   normal   use   of the    work,    and    does    not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author."        
 
This means that Slovenian courts have a wide discretion  to  decide  whether
certain activity   falls   within    "private    reproduction"    or    some
other exception. The same would apply for possible exception with regard  to
TDM.
       
Clearing all the rights necessary to lawfully engage in  TDM  activities  in
multiple databases across different  platforms  in  different  Member States
is, of course, unimaginably burdensome. IP regime as currently in use in  EU
or Slovenia in this respect is an impediment for  a  wide  use of  TDM.  For
this reason further research is necessary to identify the best  solution  to
overcome these problems.

obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services  based  on  text  or
data mining methods, including across borders?

specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

  54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]
We generally propose a legislative solution for TDM activities.



  55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?

[Open question]
Text and data mining could either  be  considered  as  an  extension  of the
right to read or be arranged as the new copyright exception in the EU.
An exception should be provided in the EU copyright law,  which would  allow
research and educational institutions to  undertake  TDM  activities without
clearing the copyrights of authors of texts and data, which are  being mined
for commercial and non-commercial research purposes.
 
An  exception  should  also  be  provided  for  other  rights,  such  as sui
generis rights of publishers.    
 
We do not support contractual approach, which would license  against payment
of   a   fee   the   usage    of    copyright    protected    material    in
TDM activities. Especially as  we  believe  TDM  activities  could  also  be
considered as part of the right to read.

  56. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]
It is required to clarify that they are unregulated usages and part  of  the
prerogatives which can be exercised once  the right  to  access  content has
been cleared through a license or is otherwise available  to  the  user  for
another reason such as an exception.


  57. Are there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
      barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?
[Open question] There are of course other  legal  issues  connected  to  TDM
activities such as for example  protection  of  personal  data  and  privacy
issues. Computer data and text processing could  also  undertake  processing
and   indexing    of    personal    names    and events    connected    with
certain individuals. Optically scanned  texts  are  then indexed  by  global
search engines like Google and  this  can  then  lead  to  public access  of
personal data,  which  was  burried  before,  only  by  entering   name   of
the individual in the search engine.      
 
Additionally also Terms of use imposed by content providers could present  a
barrier to TDM activities. Terms of  use  prohibiting  the  lawful right  to
perform data mining on a content accessed legitimately should be  considered
an  abuse  of exclusive  rights   and   declared   illegal.   Also technical
restrictions to download the content in an open format should be  considered
a barrier to data mining and their circumvention should not be considered  a
breach of Terms of use, of copyright,  or  of  effective  rights  protection
measure.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[53]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[54].

  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[55]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[56][57].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[61].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[62] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[63]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[64] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[65].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[66]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[67].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial

      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]
This would be beneficial for both the rights holders as  well  as  users  of
copyrighted works.  It  would  also  be  a  step  towards  harmonization  of
copyright and exceptions to those rights. Pursuing the  establishment  of  a
single EU Copyright Title should be the next step. This would  certainly  be
a long-term  project,  however  it  is  necessary  because  of  the  current
situation, which is far from optimal.


VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[Open question]
In addition to the reforms discussed above, as  a  general  matter,  the  EU
should support rights holders who wish to dedicate their copyrights  to  the
public domain or sharing  under  an  open  licensing  scheme.  These  rights
holder groups are an important  and  growing  constituency  whose  interests
should be duly  taken  into  account  by  policymakers.  The  issue  of  the
voluntary dedication of rights to the public domain by their  owners  is  on
the work agenda of the Committee on Development  and  Intellectual  Property
(CDIP) of the World Intellectual Property Organization  (WIPO).  As  a  WIPO
permanent  observer,  COMMUNIA  encourages   the   international   copyright
community to commit further study  to  the  legal  framework  applicable  to
voluntary non-protection.

This reflection should be concretely echoed on the  legislative  level  with
the introduction of a positive legal definition  of  the  public  domain  in
copyright rules. The  link  between  copyright  protection  and  the  public
domain has evolved over time, and needs to be clarified by legislation.  The
role of the public domain,  already  crucial  in  the  past,  is  even  more
important today, as the  Internet and  digital  technologies  enable  us  to
access, use and re-distribute information with a marginal cost of  zero.  It
has thus become necessary to reform the copyright system  to  recognize  the
existence of the public domain as a positive set  of  content  that  can  be
freely used to serve culture, innovation and  public  service  purposes,  in
complementary with exclusive protection.

of 11 July 2012 on collective management of  copyright  and  related  rights
and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for  online  uses
in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
[11]  Collective Management Organisations play a  significant  role  in  the
management of online rights for musical works in contrast to  the  situation
where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as  film  or
record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

[19] Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are  holders  of
so-called “neighbouring rights”  in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[20] The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or  indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[21] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[22] See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football  Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[23] The objective of implementing a “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[24] Injunctive relief is a  temporary  or  permanent  remedy  allowing  the
right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.

[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[30] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[31] E.g. the International  Standard  Recording  Code  (ISRC)  is  used  to

rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has  been  given  a  cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary  work  –  for

same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States  and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.
