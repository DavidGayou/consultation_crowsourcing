Contribution to the Commission’s public consultation on the review of EU
copyright rules.




                                                        Vienna, Feb. 3, 2014



This contribution is supplemented by ADA - Austrian Director’s Association.


ADA is the biggest of 3  Associations  of  Film  directors  in  Austria.  We
represent 86 Members, working fictional  or  non-fictional  for  Television,
Cinema Release or/ and other media.
Several members are not only the authors of their  films  but  also  of  the
film scripts  and  concepts.   Some  of  us  also  hold  authors  rights  as
directors of photography. In the last years multifunctional  directors  have
increased.  Adequate remuneration  is  essential  and  existential  for  our
members as for all creative professionals and therefore we do hope that  the
Commission will judge submitted statements to this  public  consultation  in
respect  of  the  fact  that  creators  are  the  minority  that  needs  the
commission’s protection in the raised issue.
Due to Austrian law specifics we also plead you to bear in mind that  it  is
absolutely essential to make clear that remunerations  from  Authors  Rights
belong to Authors and Creators and not to Producers.  ADA is the only  right
holders  Association  in  Austria  that  holds  permanent  contact  to  Net-
Activists and enforces the exchange of ideas  about  digital  communication.
Of course we could not achieve a common understanding in all topics  but  we
do value the reciprocal appreciation and this has turned out to be  fruitful
on both  sides.   Our  Members  are  interested  in  a  solid  supranational
regularization that ensures the Authors financial reward from  their  works,
enhances fast international distribution  and  access  to  their  work,  and
simplifies copyright clearance.  We do understand that  the  present  system
cannot be transferred to the Internet without criminalizing a vast  majority
of users (including ourselves) for wrong quoting, thoughtless  distribution,
illegal downloading, streaming et al. and therefore we do welcome  a  change
of rules. While finding and defining these new rules we do need  legislative
protection – ironically enough we sometimes need  to  be  protected  against
the interests of our appreciated  partners:  be  it  Users  (our  audience),
Producers, CMOs,  Publishers,  Distributors  et  al.   Although  Authors  do
sometimes enjoy a lot of  rights  on  legislative  papers,  the  reality  is
different: we are in a fairly weak position in  negotiations.  Therefore  we
often cope with incredible little financial reward.  This  may  not  be  the
core topic – but it needs to be  considered  since  copyright  remunerations
are the basis of the current film business.


Thank you for your consideration, sincerely


Dagmar Streicher
Chairwoman of ADA

Ps: In the following we do consider the director as the main-author of film
and the scriptwriter as the main author oft the film script.

II Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law9.


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery  of  multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the  structured
stakeholder dialogue “Licences for  Europe”12  and  market-led  developments
such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition13.


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability14.


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU  level  in  the  medium  term15  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.







1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced  problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other  than  the
one in which you live?


   € YES -


We are in  favor  to  increase  the  cross-border  availability  of  content
services  in  the  Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an  adequate  level  of
protection for right holders.


We live and work internationally and experience National  Borders  as  being
outdated when it comes to providing content. It is to  the  disadvantage  of
the artist, who is eager to distribute the work as broadly as  possible  and
to the disadvantage of the user who is eager  to  have  access  to  up-dated
content at all times and all places.  A harmonization of author’s  rights  -
at least within Europe is of crucial importance. It  is  necessary  to  take
into account that the remuneration for authors and creators  is  existential
and needs to be granted.





3. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial  licences?
Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per  year  and  provide
examples indicating the Member State, the sector and  the  type  of  content
concerned.


In the EU’s audiovisual sector authors usually assign their rights  for  the
whole world to  the  producer.  Audiovisual  authors  are  neither  able  to
control the distribution of  their  works,  nor  the  remuneration  for  the
exploitation of their works. We  are  more  than  willing  to  grant  multi-
territorial  licenses  in  return  we  must   be   able   to   profit   from
remunerations. We should not be forced to assign  rights  to  the  producers
because of Market usages.  Currently money flows B2B  while  Authors  cannot
profit adequately from their work.  This seems to be  systematic  and  might
be  the  reason  why  the  “Film  industry”  e.g.  Producers   Associations,
Broadcasters and sometimes CMOs are  more  eager  to  conserve  the  present
rules and are less open to digital change  while  especially  young  authors
promote, distribute and even finance their  works  in  the  net.   Also  our
established directors do miss the single protection of the Author  and  many
of them have therefore founded their  own  Production  Companies  to  be  in
charge of the exploitation of their work.








   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


EU needs to bring more Authors on  Board  when  it  comes  to  creating  new
programs such as “Licences for Europe”.  We do welcome  the  engagement  and
of course it is true to some extend that if the industry does well it is  to
our advantage.  But the EU cannot rely on the  film  industry  and  CMOs  to
ensure the Authors adequate remuneration and income.  There is also  a  vast
proportion of artistic work that is not underlying  the  mainstream  market.
We feel that  it  is  of  utmost  importance  that  these  works  are  being
supported and well distributed – also in  the  sense  of  European  cultural
diversity and exchange.  We do  have  the  feeling  that  B2B  Programs  and
industrial interests are  being  EU-funded  inorder  to  enhance  the  users
comfort but the Authors are being well forgotten.


In some cases our Collective Societies need to be more transparent and  more
flexible in regard to the changes needed to modernize  copyright  issues  to
digital age.  A further harmonization within Europe would be welcomed.








   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


NO


Of course audiovisual authors want their works to  be  accessible  all  over
Europe as long as all required authorizations have been  regularly  acquired
and paid for. We are in favor  of  an  obligation  of  exploitation  of  the
rights held (“use it or lose it”) so that distributors are  incentivized  to
actively promote the audiovisual works they have acquired.   In  some  cases
it might not be on the  basis  of  a  reasonable  commercial  assessment  to
actively promote films in some countries (language barriers et al)  and  yet
there is no need to make them inaccessible. Authors also need to  see  other
artist’s work within a reasonable timeframe but often  Austria’s  market  is
just too small for big Distributors to get involved.








   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ NO





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


   1. € YES


We do favor cross-border availability if our  rights  are  being  protected.
The protection rules should be supranational harmonized and to  the  benefit
of the authors.  We urge the Commission to  bear  in  mind  that  market-led
solutions are more likely  beneficial  to  B2B  and  the  Industry  and  not
necessarily profitable for (mostly freelance) directors.





B Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


 [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on  the
harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright  and  related  rights  in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the  protection  of  software17
and databases18.


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders19 which are essential for the transmission  of  digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise  or  prohibit  the  making  of  copies20,
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in  digital  transmissions
and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant criterion is the “targeting” of a certain Member State's  public22.
According to this approach the  copyright-relevant  act  (which  has  to  be
licensed) occurs at least in those countries which  are  “targeted”  by  the
online service provider. A service provider “targets” a group  of  customers
residing in a specific country when it directs its activity to  that  group,
e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language  or  a currency  specifically
targeted at that group.














   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


   1. € NO – Please explain how this could be clarified  and  what  type  of
      clarification would be  required  (e.g.  as  in  "targeting"  approach
      explained above, as in "country of origin" approach23)


Valid and easily verifiable Licenses need to be established. This is in  the
interest of the author, the provider and the user.







   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief24)?


   1. € YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


An Authors Work must be traceable for the author.


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


   1. € YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in  order
      to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the
      rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of
      rights")


Reproduction right and the making available right are  very  different  with
different consequences for the work and henceforth the author. A  harmonized
bundling of rights may appear fruitful.





Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are pending before the CJEU25 in  which
the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable  link
constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to  the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU26  as  to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.




  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


   1. € YES – Please explain whether you consider this to  be  the  case  in
      general, or under specific circumstances, and why


Everybody who embeds work in his website in such a manner that the  user  is
not led to the authors website, exploits work  for  his  own  benefits.  The
Embedder benefits because his website becomes more  attractive  for  visits.
In case the embedder generates revenues from advertisement or  else  on  his
website, the embedder even has a  direct  financial  benefit.  The  embedder
must be obliged to provide the right holders with an adequate  remuneration.
 In any case the Embedder  MUST  quote  or  provide  content  correctly  and
declare are rightholders and authors.


Private People in Social Networks. “Deep-linking” might be considered as  an
act  of  “communication  to  the  public”  in  the  sense  of  the  Info-Soc
Directive. Therefore, a hyperlink as such must not  need  the  authorization
of the right holder, but for “embedded” or “framed”  links  within  websites
authorization is needed, especially  if  the  linking  generates  commercial
gain.







  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


   1. € YES – Please explain whether you consider this to  be  the  case  in
      general, or under specific circumstances, and why


Temporary  reproduction  without  the  right  holders  consent   should   be
prohibited- but not the viewing itself.   In other words: Providing  content
without the right holders consent/ remuneration to  the  authors  should  be
prohibited.





4 Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of  that  tangible  article)27.  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property  of  the  copy)28.  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).





  14.  [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.


   1.  [Open question]


In digital age there is no market for "used" or  "2nd  Hand"  content  since
the quality of the original  is  the  same  as  the  quality  of  the  copy.
Henceforth there  cannot  be  a  legal  framework  for  reselling  purchased
content  without  remuneration  for  the  creators.  Not  only   would   the
consequence be that the original would lose  its  price-value,  legalization
would also provide a flourishing market without creators profiting from  it.
 This cannot be a business model for the European  creative  industry.   Our
work needs to be sufficiently  provided  by  legal  streaming  and  download
offers without geographical or time limitations. If this  is  the  case,  we
hope that the need for "used" or "2nd Hand" Market will  hopefully  diminish
or at least be reduced.  Of course this can only work IF  providing  content
without remunerations  to  the  authors  is  clearly  illegal  and  severely
avenged.





C  Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute29. Moreover a system of registration  does  not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered30.


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level  help  in  the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


   1. € YES





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


   1.  [Open question]


Easier copyright clearance. Transparency. It must be voluntary, and  public,
not private. Cooperation with existing Archives is  necessary.  It  must  be
cheap or free of charge for the authors to register  for  this  allows  also
young artists to access the system and to get money out of their work.








  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


   1.  [Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….





  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


   1.  [Open question]


Easier Copyright Clearance. Direct  money  flow  to  authors.  No  "orphaned
works".





D. ) How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been  developed31,  and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide a  single
source of  information  on  the  ownership  and  control  of  musical  works
worldwide.  The  Linked  Content  Coalition33  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34  is  seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.





  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


   9.  [Open question]


The EU should promote harmonization within European Member states  enforcing
best practice models in favor of authors e.g. Northern  Countries.   The  EU
should back up the Authors Right system as  opposed  to  the  Anglo-American
Copyright Modell.  The  EU  should  give  directives  to  harmonization  and
subsequently to easier Authors-Right Clearance on an international basis.





E. Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention35  requires
a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.  The
EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death  of  the
author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.


  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?


   1. € NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter


No they are by no means.  But also in  the  future  any  alternative  system
must make sure that: In all cases the right holder must be provided with  an
adequate remuneration for the usage  of  his/her  work.  The  protection  of
intellectual property is a human right (Art 17/2 of the EU Charta).   50  to
70 years post mortem seem to be outdated.


III Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.


Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect international law37. In accordance with  international  obligations,
the EU acquis requires that limitations and exceptions can only  be  applied
in certain special cases which do not conflict with  a  normal  exploitation
of the work or other subject matter and do not  unreasonably  prejudice  the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)38, these limitations and exceptions are often optional39,  in  the
sense that Member States are free to  reflect  in  national  legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")40.


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.





  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?


   1. € YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


Too many different (national) laws make all operations -  be  it  providing,
using, selling et al - very difficult. Even Authors have problems  to  clear
rights when using other Authors work. Projects  have  often  been  given  up
because right clearance has proven to  be  too  difficult.   In  all  cases,
however, the right holder must be provided  with  an  adequate  remuneration
for the usage of his/her work.






  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?


€ NO – Please explain


As said above, Harmonization is of utmost importance.  The Goal  must  be  a
European Copyright law.   It  would  not  be  feasible  to  make  exceptions
mandatory as long as laws are so different in the member states.



  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.




   1.  [Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….



  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?



We favor a  harmonization  within  EU  Member  States:  this  also  concerns
limitations and exceptions. We do see advantages in  strict  definition  and
rules of commercial and  non-commercial  use.   Non-Commercial  should  have
easier access but not free  of  charge.   Paintings  in  Museums  are  being
bought from the artist and there is an  entire  art-market  adjacent.    Why
should audiovisual content be free of charge just  because  it  is  easy  to
copy?  Non-negotiable solid rules providing remunerations  for  the  authors
and allow public archives, museums et al. easy  access  to  content  are  at
stake.  Copying for the sake of Preservation should  be  free  of  cost  but
living authors must be informed.



  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.






  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?


   1. € YES


We cannot distribute our work to the extent we would like to since  we  have
to obey "Territoriality principles" and we cannot view other author’s  works
without time-lapse. This decelerates our  professional  forthcoming  on  the
international highly competitive market.






  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)





Copyright clearances and the structure of the many various different CMOs
must be simplified and harmonized.   Registered Licensing would help.





A Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and  other  subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending  (under
an exception or limitation) by these establishments of  physical  copies  of
works and other subject  matter  is  governed  by  the  Rental  and  Lending
Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.


  28. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
      preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your
      collection?  (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Have  you
      experienced  problems  with  the   use   by   libraries,   educational
      establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?


€(a) Yes – research and copyright clearance proved to  be  excessively  time
consuming and complicated.  Other  works  had  been  marked  as  cc  in  the
Internet, when in fact the authors did not agree to cc licensing.


 (b) No





  29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?





Licenses must be registered and easy to proof.



  30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary)  via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for  the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of  works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on  the  premises
of the  library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers.  Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the  possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.


  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?  (b) [In particular if you are  an  end
      user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying  to
      consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held
      in the collections of institutions such as universities  and  national
      libraries when you are not on the  premises  of  the  institutions  in
      question?  (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you
      negotiated agreements  with  institutional  users  that  enable  those
      institutions to provide remote access, including across  borders,   to
      the works or other subject-matter in their collections,  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.


  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection? (b) [In particular if you are
      an end user/consumer:] Have you  experienced  specific  problems  when
      trying to borrow books or other materials electronically  (e-lending),
      including across borders, from institutions such as public  libraries?
      (c) [In particular if you are a right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
      agreements with libraries to  enable  them  to  lend  books  or  other
      materials electronically, including across borders?



  37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved



  38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences  do
      you  see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,
      including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you
      encountered?



  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?


Because of the nature of the Internet,  the  difference  between  libraries’
traditional activities and online e  lending  is  huge.  There  need  to  be
conditions / licenses allowing  libraries  to  develop  and  authors  to  be
remunerated.





Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers  on  the  other44.  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)45.


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?


   1. € YES





  41. Would it be necessary to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
      agreed for other types of content (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
      collections, broadcasters’ archives)?


   1. € YES


ADA welcomes the project “Licenses for Europe” where  Audiovisual  and  Film
Heritage Institutions undertake mass digitization and clearance  for  online
uses of the high volume of older works in  the  archives  of  film  heritage
institutions and public services broadcasters. However, right  holders  must
be guaranteed an appropriate share of the rewards.





Teaching

Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their  national
legislation limitations and exceptions for the purpose of  illustration  for
non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow a teacher  to
use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,  e.g.  by  distributing
copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the  classroom  or
by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without  having  to  obtain
authorisation  from  the  right  holders.  The  open  formulation  of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at  Member
States level. The implementation of the exception differs from Member  State
to Member State, with several Member States providing  instead  a  framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some  argue  that
the law should provide for better possibilities for  distance  learning  and
study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?


(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?


€ NO

Research

Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to  implement
in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-commercial
scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)  provision
allows for rather different implementations at Member States level.


  47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research
      projects/activities, including across borders?


(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?


(a) Yes :  Scientific and sometimes creative work is difficult with  current
various copyright laws. Simplification would be welcomed.


(b) No

Disabilities

Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the  benefit
of people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level. At  EU  and  international  level  projects  have  been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate  access  to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).


  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?




(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?


(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in       special       formats,       including       across        borders?

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data  analytics51  are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences  for  Europe”52.  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.


  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when
      trying to use text or data mining methods, including  across  borders?
      (b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Have   you
      experienced obstacles, linked to copyright,  when  providing  services
      based on text or data mining methods, including across borders?

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs53. User-generated  content  (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions54.


  58. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
      experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing  works  or  other
      subject matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
      across borders?


 (b) [In particular if you are a service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?


 (c) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?


   1. € YES –


ADA Members are very  familiar  with  creative  process  using  pre-existing
works.  We  often  use  recorded  music  and  extract  material   of   other
documentaries.


The European legislator needs to harmonize “moral  rights”  within  the  EU,
which of course is a very important aspect,  when  talking  about  UGC.  The
solution again lies in licensing schemes.


Of Course we are not in favor of free remix  without  the  authors  consent.
Some of our members do have problems with the context their  work  is  being
presented, with  wrong  quoting,  with  remixing  by  others  without  their
consent.


However, we do dislike the term UGC because it implies different  levels  of
authorship.








  59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:]
      Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you
      have  created  (on  the  basis  of  pre-existing  works)  is  properly
      identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in  this
      context?


No they are not.  Licenses must be registered with easy access to  the  Data
in order to be able to proof the validity of the License.





(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
possibilities for users that are  publishing/disseminating  the  works  they
have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through  your  service  to
properly identify these works for online use?











  60.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer  or  a  right
      holder):] Have you experienced problems when trying to be  remunerated
      for the use of the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing
      works)?


(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?


a) yes sometimes





  61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


With registered and verifiable Licenses.








  62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?


see above



  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

   I. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and  photocopying55.  Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.


  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the
      digital environment?





   1. € YES –


There should be author-friendly regulations throughout the Europe.   Private
copying must be accompanied by just compensation for authors.   The  private
copying system should be brought into the digital age  taking  into  account
that consumers make private copies  more  than  ever  before  on  ever  more
connected devices and services.






  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?59





   1. € YES


If the private copying exception was questioned and private copies  inserted
into licenses as proposed, those that would suffer most from such  a  change
would be consumers and authors. The consumers would lose  their  freedom  to
copy and authors their fair compensation.



  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?





More copying for private use takes place now  than  ever  before.  Consumers
transfer  videos  onto  computers,  hard  drives,  phones,  tablets,  online
lockers and back again.   All of these  processes  are  undeniably  acts  of
private copying.


Although ADA favors levies on storage  media  right  now,  we  do  see  this
method as short-term until better solutions are being  found.  In  the  long
run ADA does not believe that  levies  should  be  connected  with  consumer
devices and seeks for new business models in  the  near  future.   We  would
like to see the same levy system and the same tariffs in all  member  states
provided that the authors remuneration is fair.





  67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the  invoices
      for products subject to levies?60


   1. € YES –


Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments61.


  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?






69.What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold  to  persons  other
than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private  copying?  Do
any of those transactions  result  in  undue  payments?  Please  explain  in
detail the example you provide  (type  of  products,  type  of  transaction,
stakeholders, etc.).





   1.  [Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….



    70. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade  do  they
        affect? To what extent could a priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
        reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help to remedy
        the situation?

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….



    71.  If  you  have  identified  specific  problems  with  the   current
        functioning of the levy system, how would these  problems  best  be
        solved?


A quick and harmonized levy setting procedure  should  be  developed  across
Europe.  This  would  mean  putting  in  place  a  European   framework   of
definitions, principles and procedures to be respected by all Member  States
in the establishment of their levy setting process.





   I. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers62 or determining who the  owner  of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract63. This is an area that has been traditionally left  for
Member  States  to  regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences   in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.


    72. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What  is  the  best
        mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive
        an adequate remuneration for the exploitation  of  your  works  and
        performances?


Authors need to be in charge of their rights without  any  assumptions  that
right holders could be someone else but the author.  (e.g. film  producers).



Contractual practices in many European countries deprive  screenwriters  and
directors  of  their  rights  and   prevent   them   from   receiving   fair
remuneration. Screenwriters and directors are too often forced,  because  of
their weak bargaining position and the absence  of  legislation  to  protect
them, to assign all their rights to the producer or broadcaster and  receive
a one-off fee at the production stage with no  further  payments  linked  to
the exploitation of the work, except for collectively managed rights.


These further payments linked to the exploitation of the  work  are  however
essential  for  authors  to  make  a   living   in-between   projects.   The
characteristic of this profession is that it can take  years  to  prepare  a
film and enter into production.


EU Law needs to  forbid  unfair  contractual  practices  and  to  develop  a
sustainable remuneration system at EU level.  This could secure  audiovisual
authors’ remuneration for  their  making  available  right  in  the  digital
market.






    73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for  instance  to  prohibit
        certain clauses in contracts)?





   1. € YES


EU legislation needs to establish an unwaivable  and  inalienable  right  to
remuneration of audiovisual authors for their making available right,  based
on the revenues generated from the online distribution of their  works.   If
CMOs are involved in the distribution process, they need to  be  transparent
organizations and all stakeholders need to have the same rights  and  duties
within this organization.





    74. If you consider that the current  rules  are  not  effective,  what
        would you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?





European legislation should provide audiovisual authors with  an  unwaivable
and inalienable right to remuneration for the exploitation  of  their  works
based on the revenues generated from the distribution of the works.


More importantly there is a need for key standards for fair and  enforceable
contractual terms in individual  contracts,  including  the  prohibition  of
certain clauses in contracts. Authors suffer from unfair  contractual  terms
(excessive transfer of rights in terms of scope and  duration,  transfer  of
rights to remuneration, etc.) imposed by producers or  broadcasters  in  the
individual negotiation of their contract.








   I. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised  framework  for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights.  The  Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text65.
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the  role  of
intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could  be
clarification of the  safeguards  for  respect  of  private  life  and  data
protection for private users.


    75. Should the civil enforcement system in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
        efficient  for  infringements  of  copyright   committed   with   a
        commercial purpose?





   1. € YES –

to differentiate between commercial and non-commercial is essential.


    76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow
        for  sufficient involvement of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
        service providers, advertising brokers, payment service  providers,
        domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in  inhibiting  online  copyright
        infringements with a commercial  purpose?  If  not,  what  measures
        would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?







    77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the  right
        balance is achieved between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
        respected and other rights such as the protection of  private  life
        and protection of personal data?


No. Copyright  law  needs  to  be  simplified  and  renewed.  Protection  of
copyright  should  not  overrule  protection  of  private  life   or   data.
Protection of authors rights is possible  without  compromising  fundamental
rights.





   I. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.


    78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of  a  single  EU  Copyright
        Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights
        and exceptions to copyright across the EU,  as  well  as  a  single
        framework for enforcement?


€ YES





    79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the
        EU? Does the current level of difference  among  the  Member  State
        legislation mean that this is a longer term project?


In any case, EU legislative should stick to the Authors Right Model and  not
to the Anglo American Copyright  Model.  EU  legislative  needs  to  protect
Authors more than  production  companies  or  Broadcasters.  EU  legislative
should recline  to  best  practice  models  for  Authors  in  Europe’s  most
progressive and author-friendly member states.  Creators must be  placed  at
the center of EU copyright policy.





   I. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.


    80. Are there any other important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
        framework for copyright?  Please  explain  and  indicate  how  such
        matters should be addressed.


The copyright system is to be reconnected to creators.   Creators  ought  to
be the first and main beneficiaries of the  license  fees  and  remuneration
paid by users. The current European copyright law does not provide for  such
a guarantee, except in limited cases.


Today  our  copyright-laws  and  practices  fit   the   benefit   of   major
entertainment companies, big labels and publishers more  that  the  interest
of Creators.
