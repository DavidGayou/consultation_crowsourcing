   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,

   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,

   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


[Open question]


Journalists  usually  licence  their  publishers  and   broadcasters   their
exclusive rights over their work for specific purposes, for a  limited  time
period. This can be done either in an individual employment contract  or  in
a collective agreement. Licences usually mention the place  where  the  work
will be exploited, be it in the analogue or digital  environment.  Sometimes
journalists are forced to sign  individual  buy-out  contracts  whereby  all
their  authors’  rights  are  transferred  to  publishers  and  broadcasters
without any geographical limits nor additional remuneration for these uses.


When their rights have not be assigned,  or  have  reverted  to  journalists
following a specific time period,  journalists  can  also  decide  to  grant
collecting societies exclusive rights or  allow  them  to  manage  secondary
uses of their works on multiple territories.








   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]


In respect of  the  type  of  rights  administered  by  SAJ,  no  particular
problems have been reported to SAJ regarding multi-territory licensing.





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


X YES – Please explain by giving examples


Press freedom does not  have  the  same  level  of  protection  in  each  EU
countries. Defamation for instance is handled differently in the  UK  or  in
France. Rules on blasphemy, privacy vary from one  country  to  another.  In
addition the protection of moral right  would  impose  that  a  journalistic
work is not used on a  platform  that  the  author  does  not  agree  to  be
published or accessible on. For all these reasons a journalist can  find  it
necessary to impose territorial restrictions on the service provider.

   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the

      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on

      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?

   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO


No. the current legal system does not prevent authors from making their
work available across border.


Concerns regarding abusive contractual clauses and  compensation  for  using
authors’ rights will be addressed in question 72.


€ NO OPINION


Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


X YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


€YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO


No clarification is needed for the making available right to have an  effect
on the recognition of journalists’ rights. As soon as  a  journalistic  work
is created, exclusive rights belong to the author, be them making  available
or reproduction rights. The  exploitation  of  these  rights  must  be  made
clear, and adequate remuneration must be paid for these  exploitations.  See
question 72.


€ NO OPINION


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO
With the availability of journalistic works online, both rights are usually
licenced to the publisher/broadcaster for the exploitation of the work.
However, the need to remunerate the exploitation of these rights is key.

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


….





X NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)


See Svensson judgment.





€ NO OPINION




  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why





X NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)


Temporary  acts  of  reproduction  which  are  an  essential   part   of   a
technological process for the purpose of lawful  permitted  use  fall  under
Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC.


Recital 33 of the above mentioned directive provides a very clear answer  to
this  question,  limiting  this  exception  to   transient   or   incidental
reproductions forming an integral and  essential  part  of  a  technological
process and carried out for the sole prupose of  enabling  either  efficient
transmission in a network between third parties  by  an  intermediary  or  a
lawful use of a work o  other  subject  matter  to  be  made.  The  acts  of
reproduction should have no separate economic value on their own.

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

[Open question]


The exhaustion principle is only relevant to hard copies of work and  should
not apply to online services and online copies that will remain  of  perfect
quality and never deteriorate, including  in  cases  where  the  author  has
authorised the reproduction or making available of his/her work. This is  in
line with recital  29  of  directive  2001/29.  Any  attempt  to  apply  the
exhaustion principle would result in an  obvious  reduction  of  income  for
authors who rely on the possibility to licence their work.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES


X NO


€ NO OPINION





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


Under current international copyright legislation,  registration  cannot  be
made  compulsory  or  constitute  a  precondition  for  the  protection  and
exercise of rights. A registry could be established on  a  voluntary  basis.
The possible advantages of registration, provided it  is  established  on  a
voluntary basis, include the identification and  proof  of  rights  and  the
facilitation of copyright licensing. However, authors and publishers  cannot
be required or expected to monitor notifications in the EU  and  its  Member
States.





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


A work generates authors’  rights  protection  by  its  very  existence  and
should not be subject to any formality (article 5.2  Berne  convention).  In
addition, in the  news  sector  where  journalists  often  produced  several
stories a day, registering a work would be  an  additional  burden  for  any
professional and their employer.  However,  the  European  Commission  could
explore ways to support and encourage standardised identifiers.





  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]


None…………………………………………………………………………………………….

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]


Identifiers are crucial when it comes to online uses of works and the
reduction of orphan works in circulation. While press articles are usually
put online without specific identifiers, photographers usually incorporate
a specific tag to protect their work. Metada incorporated in a photograph
with sufficient information about his/her author will enable the latter to
track the uses of his/her work. It also allows users to find a specific
photographer more easily.


The EU has a role to play in promoting the importance for authors to
identify their work and highlight the benefit that those identifications
can have for users too.


Awareness raising campaigns on the importance to protect identifiers, and
sanctions for their removal are also key.


Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

X YES – Please explain


The 70 years term protection for authors is justified even more when works
available in the digital environment are accessible and reproduced for very
limited costs at a very wide scale in perfect quality condition for an
unlimited time. The length of copyright protection is therefore justified
to compensate authors for the income lost due to improved copying
technologies in the digital environment.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain


EU authors’ rights’ national legislation reflect  different  traditions  and
practices and this is particularly the case of exceptions  and  limitations.
There are problems at  national  level  when  an  exception  is  not  fairly
compensated or where some  authors  are  not  adequately  protected  against
certain uses, but this is a different issue. In  addition,  the  three  step
test serves as a sound safeguard for ensuring that any  exception  does  not
unduly harm authors and impact  their income.





€ NO OPINION


  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain


See above. The importance to provide compensation to authors for  exceptions
and limitations is key to main creators’ income.  In  particular  Article  5
(2) (b) should be enforced properly by ensuring that a fair compensation  is
paid in cases of copies made for private uses. The same should apply to  all
exceptions and limitations that member states decide to implement.


€ NO OPINION



  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]

Rather than considering whether to remove or add to the  current  exceptions
and limitations focus should be on the implementation of the  existing  ones
and stakeholder solutions developed on the basis of them. Examples  of  such
stakeholder-driven solutions, which still need to be fully implemented,  are
the ARROW[41]  system  to  facilitate  rights  information  management,  the
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Key Principles on the Digitisation  and
Making Available of  Out-of-Commerce  Works[42],  and  the  EU  Stakeholders
Dialogue Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on  access  to  works  by  people
with print disabilities[43]. Also, we see a need for  the  EU  to  adopt  an
overarching policy on Intellectual Property (IP).

  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain why


There is wide and sufficient degree of flexibility at EU level. The need  to
compensate  authors  for  using  their  work  as  part  of  exceptions   and
limitations should be a priority. Many online uses tend to compete with  the
normal exploitation of authors’ rights and infringe the 3-steps test.


€ NO OPINION


  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

€ NO OPINION


  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]

The first user should pay the compensation. In the case of private copy  for
instance, it should be the manufacturer.


Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[44] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[45].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[46].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

previous one (n° 2).

  38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences  do
      you  see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,
      including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you
      encountered?

[Open question]

E-lending is a part of the publishers’ business model. As selling access  to
copyright works, rather than physical copies, is an essential  part  of  the
business model in the  digital  environment,  in  particular  in  trade-book
publishing, library e-lending will more  easily  conflict  with  the  normal
exploitation of the work and unreasonably prejudice the legitimate  interest
of the rightholder. Also, it may no longer be seen to  represent  a  special
case, and thus easily conflict with all three  criteria  of  the  three-step
test in international conventions that EU Member States are party to.





E-lending from libraries can, and should, nonetheless, take  place,  on  the
basis  of  contractual  arrangements  with  copyright   holders   or   their
representatives. Arrangements already exist in  several  EU  Member  States.
Various models are  being  explored,  and  the  main  challenge  now  is  to
conclude on the range of models that best serve the assortment of  purposes.






One should also note that the e-book market is only at a nascent stage,  and
that sales to consumers represent the majority of the trade-book market.

  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?

[Open question]

Recital 2 of Directive 2006/115/EC on rental and lending  right  points  out
that the rental and lending of copyright works for  authors,  especially  in
connection with piracy operations  plays  an  increasingly  important  role.
Recital 4 also suggests that copyright and related  rights  protection  must
adapt to new economic developments such as new  forms  of  exploitation.  On
this basis,  it  can  be  stated  that  electronic  Lending  processes  have
different effects in terms of  economic  interests  of  authors  as  renting
procedures adopted in the analogue environment. The sale  of  a  book  after
its first sale might not be  of  great  interest  to  the  author,  but  the
electronic lending of digital content of excellent  quality  may  very  well
have a significant impact on its business model. The  electronic  access  to
an author’s work including by  way  of  electronic  renting  must  therefore
remain subject to his/her consent.


The three step test should be an important role here.





Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[47].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[48].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to

      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[49]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional

The implementation  of  article  5  (3)  (a)  must  meet  the  objective  of
illustrating for teaching purposes and should not overtake this purpose.  In
particular, the non –commercial aspect of this  exception  is  important  in
order not to compete with journalists’ activities  and  right  to  syndicate
their work.

  43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

The  public’s  perception  of  the  legitimacy  of  an  exception  including
compensation will occur when  they  are  confident  that  a  share  of  this
compensation  is  distributed  to  the  author.  Problem  can   occur   when
journalists do not receive any remuneration for the use of  their  work  for
illustration for teaching. This can be the case  when  they  are  forced  to
sign away their exclusive rights to their employers.


It would be useful to raise awareness on the extent of exception 5 (3)  (a):
illustration for teaching or scientific research only, the need  to  include
the source and the authors’ name,  the  non-commercial  purpose  only.  This
means that the  exception  does  not  grant  the  user  a  licence  to  make
available, reproduce, distribute, broadcast  the  entire  journalistic  work
(either print, audiovisual or photograph).




  44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to  facilitate  the  use  of
      content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
      they?

[Open question]

Unless they  have  assigned  their  exclusive  rights  to  their  employers,
journalists usually grant a licence to a collecting society to manage  their
rights and this would cover  the  exception  for  teaching  of  illustration
purposes.






  45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under what conditions?

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[50]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[51]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [52].

The Marrakesh Treaty[53] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?



(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?

X YES – Please explain by giving examples


It is crucial to increasing the availability of  special  format  copies  of
textual  works  including  journalistic  works  for   persons   with   print
disabilities whilst respecting authors’ rights. Any use of a work must  also
ensure that  the  author  is  compensated  for  the  use  of  his/her  work.
Journalists and authors are forced to sign away their  exclusive  rights  to
their employers. This means that no remuneration is paid to them in return.

  52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility
      to content? How successful are they?

[Open question]


Publishers are increasingly publishing books in the e-Pub format, which  can
be directly converted  into  files  accessible  to  persons  who  are  print
disabled.[54] Those files can be sold to users directly or  to  institutions
serving the community of the print disabled.





Exceptions and limitations to the exclusive rights in favour of persons  who
are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled, exist in  all  EU
Member  States.  Also,  RROs  administer  statutory  provisions   or   offer
licensing agreements to facilitate access to copyright published  works  for
those user groups.





The main challenge is linked to  the  cross-border  exchange  of  accessible
format copies. The WIPO Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published  Works  for
Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled,  will
undoubtedly contribute to the enhancement of the  cross-border  exchange  of
such copies. It will, however, take time for the Treaty to come  into  force
and be implemented in national legislation. Also, it  may  not  alone  solve
all challenges.





The licensing agreement offered by the UK RRO,  Copyright  Licensing  Agency
Ltd. (CLA), allows for the distribution of accessible format  copies  within
the EU[55]. The Austrian and  German  RROs,  Literar-Mechana  and  VG  Wort,
administer statutory licences  and  have  developed  solutions  for  certain
cross-border issues regarding material in the German language. IFRRO  offers
tools to its members,  which  also  address  the  cross-border  exchange  of
accessible format copies.[56] Furthermore, with  the  view  to  enhance  the
cross-border  exchange  of  accessible  format  copies,  IFRRO  participates
actively, with representatives of persons with print  disabilities,  authors
and publishers, in the EC-facilitated ETIN  (European  Trusted  Intermediary
Network)[57] and the WIPO-facilitated  TIGAR  (Trusted  Intermediary  Global
Accessible Resources)[58] projects on enhanced access to copyright works  by
persons with print disabilities.


Thus, there exist solutions in the market place, as well as initiatives  and
pilots that can be built further on. Their success in the  EU  is  dependent
on the willingness of the EC and the EU Member States to invest in them  and
also support financially the development of the required networks  that  the
stakeholders stand ready to establish and maintain.


Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[59] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[60].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

Q53 is presented in a way that it requires a  “No”-response  from  us.  This
does, however, not mean that there are no problems linked to Text  and  Data
Mining  (TDM)  from  the   side   of   the   copyright   holder   or   their
representatives.  The  main  ones  are  the  need  for  clear   and   agreed
definitions of text mining and data mining; right of  the  copyright  holder
to control access to their databases; protection against unfair  competition
linked to commercial exploitation of text and data mining; and the  lack  of
constructive dialogue with some key user groups,  in  particular  those  who
walked out of  the  European  Commission  Licences  for  Europe  stakeholder
dialogue initiative. The preferred way to solve  this  is  to  clarify  that
there will be no exception for TDM.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[61]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[62].

removed thus impeding the  possibility  to  identify  the  author  and  seek
permission to use his/her work. This authorization  could  be  given  either
via a collecting society (if  the  author  has  decided  to  allow  them  to

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question] In the digital environment, press  publishers  have  started
using  more  straightforward  digital  solutions  to  share  their  content
legally, and as widely as possible.[63]

Technology is being further developed to facilitate click-through  licensing
solutions for users. In particular, a cross-media, multinational  coalition
of more than 40 partners from the media and creative industries,  including
representatives of authors and artists, are  working  together  with  their
standards bodies to establish automated and semi-automated  communications,
based  on  identifiers  and  interoperable  metadata   standards,   between
rightholders and those who wish to use content[64]. Similarly, any web user
creating new content, whether it involves re-use  of  existing  content  or
not, should be able to add  such  identifiers  to  enable  them  to  better
protect and potentially monetise their content.[65]

Also, a toolkit for licensing has been developed  within  the  framework  of
the Licences for Europe  initiative,  in  its  Working  Group  on  UGC  and
Licensing for small-scale users of protected material (WG2). This document,
which has been signed by EFJ, EPC, EVA, EWC, FEP,  STM  and  IFRRO,  brings
together, for the first time, a range of licensing solutions, namely: 
    • Solutions for the identification  of  rightholders,  their  agents  or
      other representatives (such as  CMOs)  from  whom  permission  can  be
      sought; 
    • Solutions to give users  information  about  licensing  and  licensing
      conditions: how the licensing process works and what users can do with
      a work under a chosen licence; 
Streamlined  one-click/click   through/accessible   and   easy   pay-per-use
transactional systems that make the licensing process quicker and easier.


  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[66]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[67][68].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[69]  in
      the digital environment?

X YES – Please explain


There is a need for  clarification  that,  in  respect  of  text  and  image
levies,  “rightholders”  eligible  for  “fair  compensation”  comprise  both
authors and publishers.


Otherwise, there is no need to change articles 5.2 (a) and 5.2  (b)  of  the
EUCD. In particular, it must continue  to  be  a  requirement  that  certain
exceptions are only permissible if fair  compensation  is  provided  to  the
rightholders.


Devices which enable or  host  private  copies  as  well  as  their  storage
capacities have grown exponentially. It would be important to  clarify  that
the private copy exception also apply in the digital  environment  including
on the cloud.

  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[70]

X YES – Please explain


The “VG Wort” CJEU ruling (C-457/11  to  C-460/11)[71]  clarified  that  the
fact  that  rightholders’   have  expressly  or  implicitly  authorised  the
reproduction of their  protected  work  or  other   subject-matter  and  the
possibility  of  applying  technical  protection  measures  (TPMs)  have  no
bearing on the fair compensation owed.


In its ruling in the “Padawan”  case  (C-467/08)the  CJEU  made  clear  that
levies should be calculated  according to  the  assumed  harm  sustained  by
rightholders by the private copying in


question. In addition it stressed that whereas the  harm  of  an  individual
copy  might  be  limited,  the  harm  caused  by  millions  of   copies   is
considerable.

  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]


Consumers  make  copies  more  than  ever  before  on   devices   that   are
interconnected and store copies in the cloud. Unless private  copy  is  paid
to compensate authors for these news uses of their work,  the  revenue  will
necessarily suffer from this  lack  of  consideration  of  additional  uses.
Moreover, a licence would not ensure that authors  are  compensated  in  any
form,  while  a  levy  collected  by  a  collecting  society  that  is  duly
representative of authors will ensure that.




  67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
      for products subject to levies?[72]

X YES – Please explain


The need for transparency is important in order  not  to  mislead  consumers
and inform them  on  the  amount  collected  and  the  destination  of  this
compensation. Private copying levies should be made clearly visible  on  all
invoices  and  contracts  in  the  products’  sales  chain,   including   on
consumers’ invoices and till receipts.

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[73].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

€ YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate  the  percentage
of the undue payments. Please also indicate how a  priori  exemption  and/or
ex post reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.

X NO – Please explain


In respect of text and image  levies,  the  refund  of  device  and  storage
medium  remuneration  in  the  event  of  export  takes  place  through  the
responsible RRO, without problems in the vast majority  of  cases.   On  the
other hand, there are substantial problems  linked  to  vendors  of  devices
based in another EU Member State refusing to pay the levy.[74]


Concrete consideration should be given  to  the  possible  creation  at  the
European level of a central agency which could control the refund on a  pan-
European basis. Also,  EU  regulations  are  required  to  ensure  that,  in
relation to import/export of devices, there is no ambiguity with respect  to
the obligation to pay the levy according to the tariffs and methods  of  the
country of destination to the RRO in  that  country.  In  this  respect,  it
should also be clarified that any dispute should  be  regulated  in  and  in
accordance with the rules of the country where the levy shall be collected.

  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

[Open question]

In  respect  of  text  and  image  (reprography)  levies,  the  question  is
irrelevant, as noted also in  the  report  from  the  EC-appointed  mediator
António Vitorino[75]. Unlike the scope  of  the  private  copying  exception
under EUCD Article 5.2(b), which is limited to reproductions  that  serve  a
specific purpose ("for private use") regardless of the type  of  device  and
method,  the  reprography  exception  under  EUCD  Article   5.2(a)   covers
reproductions on a specific medium (paper), using a  specific  method  ("any
kind of photographic technique"), regardless of its purpose,  which  may  be
for professional, educational, private and other uses.[76] This  means  that
the reprography levies cover both private and professional uses.


Consequently, when it comes to analysing the impact of  reprography  levies,
it is not relevant to make a distinction between  private  and  professional
uses, since both of them are subject to the payment of a levy. Against  this
background, it is also unnecessary to distinguish between sales  of  devices
in the private and business sectors. The point is that copies are  permitted
by law in both the private and business spheres. The – unified – device  and
storage medium remuneration can therefore be justified  both  for  sales  to
private persons and sales to business end users.






  70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
      affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
      reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
      the situation?

[Open question]

We refer to our response to question  69,  which,  in  short,  states  that,
under EUCD Article 5.2(a), text and image (reprography) levies  also  covers
professional uses. Question 70 therefore becomes irrelevant in  relation  to
text and image (reprography) levies.



  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?


[Open question]


A main problem is the tendency to mix private copying levies  and  text  and
image (reprography) levies, and to argue the reprography levy as if it  were
identical to private copy levies.  This  is  not  the  case;  the  two  levy
schemes are  different  (see  question  69).  The  EU  could  contribute  to
clarification through sensitising EC officials  and  EU  policy  makers  and
institutions that text  and  image  (reprography)  and  private  levies  are
different, and ensure consistency in their dealing with  the  two  different
levy schemes.


Also, as mentioned under question  68,  it  should  be  considered  to  what
extent the handling of cases of export could be  facilitated  by  a  central
European agency, and the obligation for exporters to pay the levy  according
to the rules of the country of destination should be regulated.


   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[77] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[78]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

[Open question]

A 2013 UN report  on  The  right  to  freedom  of  artistic  expression  and
creativity[79] points  at  “coercive  contracts  that  authors  and  artists
identify as a primary obstacle to fair remuneration. Under  such  contracts,
which are frequent, creators sign away all their rights  to  their  creation
in order to gain a commission for creating a work. Consequently,  they  lose
control over their creation, which can be used  in  contradiction  to  their
own vision”.


Collective agreements are the best way to ensure that journalists  are  paid
for primary (first publication or broadcast) and secondary uses  (archiving,
publication in another title, in  the  other  media  group,  rebroadcasting,
sale to another newspaper) of their works.


These agreement  should  be  combined  with  the  work  done  by  collecting
societies  which  are  duly  representative  of  journalists,   to   collect
remuneration for other secondary uses such  as  private  copy,  reprography,
lending. Collective agreements should  also  include  freelance  journalists
and photographers who are often considered  as  self-entrepreneurs  with  no
possibility to act collectively and being forced to assign  their  exclusive
rights for a unique lump sum, independent of the futures uses  that  can  be
made of their works. Section 32 of  the  German  Copyright  Act  provides  a
sound basis for revising contracts that are deemed to be unequitable.


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?

X YES – Please explain


A number of unfair clauses should be prohibited in  the  EU  legislation  in
order to compensate for the uneven  bargaining  situation  that  journalists
and other authors have to face. For instance, clauses that assign rights  in
future works for unknown uses,  buy-outs  clauses  (lumps  sumps  agreed  in
return for the transfer of all exclusive rights  for  an  indefinite  time),
clauses allowing for moral right transfer, clauses unreasonably  restricting
the right for journalists to work in a similar  sector,  clauses  that  only
allow a journalist to be paid in authors’ rights  and  not  in  salary  thus
impeding him/her for social protection and social benefits.

  74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what  would
      you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

[Open question]

It would be key for  the  European  Commission  to  start  focusing  on  the
contractual bargaining power at stake in the creative  sector  that  forbids
most authors from any possibility to claim additional remuneration  for  the
use of their  works,  due  in  particular  to  abusive  clauses  and  rights
transfer mechanisms embedded in employment  contracts.  Section  32  of  the
German copyright act  2002 allowing for a review of the employment  contract
when the remuneration received  by  the  author  ins  unequitable  could  be
considered as  a  sound  basis.  In  accordance  with  this  section  German
association of journalists  (DJU  an  DJV)  and  the  Federation  of  German
Newspaper  Publishers  agreed  on  “joint  remuneration   rules   for   free
journalists at daily newspapers”.


Another area of action would be to allow for small  cases  court  mechanisms
that allow authors to sue at  limited  costs.   The  need  for  professional
associations and trade unions to be able to sart legal  proceedings  against
those who use these  types  of  contracts  is  crucial  to  avoid  freelance
journalists   becoming   isolated    and    black    listed    for    future
assignments……………………………………………………………………….

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[80] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[81].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[82]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[83].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

X YES – Please explain


Wider legal access  to  works  can  only  be  achieved  through  appropriate
mechanisms which include direct licensing  by  authors  and  publishers  and
collective  management  of  rights,  combined  with  financial   incentives,
protection  against  infringement  and  copyright   enforcement,   including
efficient combating of piracy and other forms of unauthorised  reproduction.
CMOs play an indispensable role  in  assisting  authors  and  publishers  to
enable wider legal access to  their  works  and  in  awareness  raising  and
enforcement of rights.


€ NO – Please explain

  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]

Collaboration with Internet Service Providers (ISPs)  to  address  copyright
infringement  and  enforcement  issues  is  welcome.  The  Commission  could
facilitate initiatives in this respect through  financial  contributions  to
awareness-raising campaigns. The use of filtering technologies by  ISPs  and
others as well as systems to  inform  about  authorised  use  (e.g.  through
search engines  using  the  ACAP[84])  are  highly  welcome  and  should  be
encouraged. These are mechanisms which help in enforcing  contractual  terms
and preventing  the  networks  from  being  used  to  infringe  intellectual
property.





The Commission should also encourage the investment in new business  models.
The establishment of a sustainable  legal  offer,  reflecting  the  cultural
diversity of the  European  written  sector,  can  only  take  place  in  an
environment ensuring the full respect of copyright  and,  therefore,  the  –
financial – independence of creators. Against this  background,  we  request
that the Commission maintains a  stable  and  predictable  legal  framework,
promoting its rationale and its enforcement by all players.



  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

X YES – Please explain


The right balance of protection of copyright with other fundamental  rights,
such as privacy and protection of personal data, needs to be  found  on  the
basis of the principle of  proportionality,  in  the  discretion  of  Member
States (see the  cases  Productores  de  Música  de  España  (Promusicae)  v
Telefónica  de  España   SAU   (C-275/06[85])   and   LSG-Gesellschaft   zur
Wahrnehmung von Leistungsschutzrechten GmbH v Tele2  Telecommunication  GmbH
(C-557/07[86])).

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


X NO


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

In respect of the copyright legal  framework,  the  EU  should  continue  to
pursue a  pragmatic  approach.  Rather  than  emphasising  on  a  single  EU
Copyright Title,  the  focus  should  be  on  the  adoption  of  an  overall
intellectual property (IP) strategy. Several  studies  have  documented  the
importance of the IP sector to the EU economy and employment:  For  example,
IPR intensive industries contribute to 39% of the EU’s GDP and  26%  of  the
EU’s employment; 90% of its  export  comes  from  IP  intensive  industries.
Within the IP sector, the  copyright  sector  contributes  with  a  positive
trade balance. On a short, medium and longer  term,  an  overarching  EU  IP
strategy is required and urgent to maintain this situation.





Work on a single EU Copyright Title would require substantial resources  and
unnecessarily distract focus from the important work on  an  overall  EU  IP
strategy. Also, it is difficult to see how it could be  established  on  the
basis of Article 118 of the Lisbon Treaty (TFEU). The  different  traditions
and systems, which include both common and civil law practices benefit  from
being maintained. Even if sufficient unanimity should be reached amongst  EU
Member States as to the nature of EU copyright legislation, it is  difficult
to see that an overarching EU Copyright Title is required.


VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[Open question]

We suggest that the creation of a specialised panel of  judges,  responsible
for copyright legal matters, is created at the CJEU. More and more cases  on
copyright  issues  are  decided  by  the  CJEU.  This  requires   a   stable
institution with copyright experts.

Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).

[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.

currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

effects of the MoU. The French  act  (LOI  n°  2012-287  du  1er  mars  2012
relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe  siècle)
foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher  in  question
opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption  of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are  not  members
of the collecting society.

[61] A typical example could be the “kitchen”  or  “wedding”  video  (adding
one's own video to a pre-existing sound  recording),  or  adding  one's  own
text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are  “mash-ups”  (blending
two sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic  work  (report,
review etc.) in a blog.
