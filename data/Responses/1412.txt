   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)

   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).

   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


[Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….





   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]


(First of all, excuse me for my English, I usually don’t use it).  The  best
way would be to create a license at European level obtainable in any  member
state. It would be against all logic  that  the  final  consumer,  that  has
purchased the product, hasn’t the right to enjoy it in any member state.


Also, keep in mind that European citizenship allows us  to  move  freely  in
any member state. It goes  against  all  logic  that  you  can’t  enjoy  the
content that you have purchased  (in  your  country)  in  any  other  Member
State, or that if you are going to live  in  any  other  country  you  can’t
enjoy the content generated in your home country.


In short: there should be a license at European level, and enable  consumers
to enjoy the content acquired in any member state (and  even  if  you  leave
the European Union).





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain


As I explained above, it would be necessary to create a  single  Europe-wide
license, so anyone could buy the product regardless of the member  state  to
which it belongs.


This would favour that the nationals of a  country  that  lives  in  another
member state could continue to enjoy content generated in their  country  no
matter where they buy it. Also it  would  favour  that  nationals  of  other
member countries could enjoy the content generated in  other  countries  and
get to know other cultures.


€ NO – Please explain

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

The concepts are fairly clear,  but  are  invalid.  Internet  is  global.  A
German in Canada can download books from Germany like a  Swedish  who  knows
German.
The advantage of digital content is  that  it  is  accessible  for  everyone
anywhere in the world. Set boundaries  in  a  single  market,  such  as  the
European, does not make sense, but  could  have  it  as  a  single  European
border, even if  it  means  limiting  the  potential  market  by  not  being
"available" for the  rest  of  the  world  (and  therefore  losing  a  great
market).


€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

€ NO


€ NO OPINION


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)


It is impossible that the copyright owner can give  permission  to  millions
of people simultaneously. For private and personal use permission should  be
taken for granted. For profit use should be given  permission.  For  use  of
part of the content (a webpage that is  making  a  review  of  a  book,  for
example) in an act of public communication the permission  should  be  taken
for granted if the reference to the author and his work is clearly visible.


€ NO OPINION




  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)


No, under any circumstances. Essentially this is how  a  browser  works  (by
the way, the vast majority of  people  do  not  even  know  that  the  cache
exists, much less how to get the content of it).
It is like if you would erase the memory of a  person  after  he  watched  a
movie, keep it in the memory is how the brain works, the same for a  browser
and his cache (temporally).


By the way, how do the rightholder   thinks  that  I  can  see  the  content
without displaying it on the screen? And how the rightholder thinks  that  I
can watch fluidly a  movie  without  a  cache  where  that  movie  downloads
previously?


€ NO OPINION


Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


Yes, a e-book bought on Amazon with DRM. There are lots of ways to  get  rid
of the DRM and the only things that DRM does is to anger de consumer.  There
are several cases of  DRM in videogames that where so strong that  even  the
legal copy was unreadable, the solution provided by the seller was to  apply
a crack (yes, pirating your legal copy to be able to play it).


There is another restriction, e-books from Amazon are in azw3  format.  What
happens when I buy a eReader that reads ePub files and not azw3 files?  Have
I lost all my ebooks? There sould be an option to  be  able  to  convert  al
your digital library to other formats and be able to enjoy  them.  The  only
solution so far is to get rid of  the  DRM  and  converting  them  with  any
converter. The own seller should give that solution.


There are videogame sellers that sold the videogames  without  any  DRM  and
they are making money without having problems with “piracy”.


About the principle of EU exhaustion, if the  product  is  available  to  by
bought in any country of the EU, then the principle of EU exhaustion  should
be applied.


About on how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a copy of  a  work  after
they have “re-sold” it, the solution can be to create a web page  where  the
new owner can  download  a  program  that  scans  the  digital  content  and
extracts a code, that code should be put on the webpage and it would  create
a patch that can be applied to the digital content  and  that  modifies  the
code. So, when the original owner tries to use the product it will not  work
because the old code has been banned, and now the new owner is who  has  the
legal code and is who can enjoy the digital content.

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


There are two rights  colliding:  the  right  of  the  rightholder  (writer,
musician, etc.), and the right of the people. The rightholder has the  right
to win money with his work. The  people  has  the  right  of  accessing  the
content for free. Why has the people  the  right  to  access  for  free  the
content? Because that is what makes advance our civilization and makes  flow
the money. When the access to the culture was only  for  a  few  privileged,
why lived thousands of years without any advance, but  with  Gutenberg,  the
universities, where the information was at disposal  of  all  for  free,  we
advanced in a few hundred years what  we  never  advanced  in  thousands  of
years before, see all what we have now in medicine,  locomotion,  science...
What would be of Hollywood, Walt Disney and so many  writers  and  musicians
if they couldn’t access to the content previously generated  by  others  (be
the way, Disney uses the works of others to do their movies, and  then  they
license it so that no one can even use the original work.  That  should  not
be so, it stops the market)? How about if patents would last  as  long  like
the rights of books? There would have  been  little  progress  (think  about
medicine patens and so).


Such a system, well done, that grants rightholders to gain money  for  their
work and for people to access it for free, that would work. But how?


Writers says that books sells usually the first  3  months,  after  that  it
goes down. The same happens with music, movies and videogames.


So, the thing is to create a law where  the  rightholder  has  the  security
that the 6 months after the publication of a work,  no  one  will  copy  his
work. But after these 6 months, the work will be  accessible  for  free  for
all (the work can have a donation link, so people that gets it for free  can
donate money to the rightholder –yes, people are  willing  to  pay  even  if
they get the work for free).


If the book (also song, movie, etc.) appears on a web,  the  webmaster  will
be warned, and he will have 48 hours to retire the  link  of  the  protected
content, and if he don’t do it, then the web page will  be  totally  blocked
for the amount of time that the protection of the protected  work  lasts  (6
months maximum). There is nothing more needed, just be blocking his  web  he
will lose his subscriptors and the page will lose his traffic, there  is  no
need of more punishment.


It will be necessary to create a webpage where the products  (books,  songs,
movies, etc.) will be registered, and these products will have the 6  months
protection (for new content generated after the new law is published).


But if the webmaster has a backup of the webpage and  opens  a  new  webpage
with all the content, included the protected link, then he will be sued  for
breaking a law. Of course there should be also punishments for the  industry
if they abuse.


Now, rightholders will say that then people will just wait  to  pass  the  6
months. But then,  why  Hollywood  is  breaking  constantly  the  record  of
incomes by films (even if they claim that piracy is hurting them,  curious).
And the same happens with books, music, videogames, etc.


People want’s to access to the content when it comes out, that’s  way.  Just
to avoid spoilers or just to be able to interact  with  their  friends  (all
are commenting the new movie and you without be able to  say  nothing  about
it? No, you must see it. So works society).


The fact is that Switzerland government ordered a study about piracy and  it
came out that piracy don’t harms de industry. The fact  is  that  there  are
lots of free videogames online and they  are  breaking  records  of  incomes
with their ingame shop (where people is free to decide if they want  to  buy
anything or not). Annual incomes of LoL (League of Legends), a totally  free
videogame with ingame shop,  are  of  624  million  annually  (yes,  a  free
videogame).


Videogame industry said that Valve saved the videogame market for  PC.  How?
What has  made  Valve  different  from  the  videogame  industry?  The  only
difference is the price, Valve is selling the games at a  reasonable  price,
and with very good discounts. And they sell  the  games  online,  accessible
for all.


About the cinemas. In Spain the entrance  costs  10-12€,  and  they  cinemas
were closing lacking of customers. But when they changed the  price  to  3€,
then they saw how they were gaining a lot more, cinemas where viable  again.
Of course the cinema industry said it was only something punctual  and  they
were continuing selling entrances at 10-12€ and blaming  people  don’t  come
to cinemas and that it was fault of piracy (businessman  in  Spain  are  so,
that explains a lot about actual Spanish economy).


So, the problem is not piracy, but the price  of  the  products.  What  they
call piracy, is free advertising. Do you think I will buy (usually  20€,  at
last in Spain) a music disk or a movie in a DVD that y don’t knew if I  like
it or not? Of course not, I download it and if I like it a buy it, and  even
if I don’t buy it, it will generate money. How? I can talk about  the  music
disc or movie to my friends and they could buy it. Of course, if y like  the
writer (musician, actor, etc.) I will buy his next book  and  merchandising.
There are studies that proves that people that download pirated  content  is
also the people that buy most.


When Germany blocked videoclips on youtube, sales of music disc  fell,  till
they re enabled them. So, why would people buy music discs if they can  hear
them for free on youtube? Because if they like  them,  they  buy  them,  and
they discover new musicians. Cutting the access to that  free  content  only
harms  the  industry.  An  aggressive  copyright  law  will  only  harm  the
industry. If the industry would have  been  right,  there  would  have  been
years since they had to close their  business.  But  year  after  year  they
break records of entrances (tickets) sold. So, what  industry  claims  about
piracy seems not to be true. The truth is  that  they  just  don’t  want  to
adapt to the new economics, the new markets.


It’s like a few centuries ago  the  crossbow  industry  where  blocking  the
access to fire weapons just because it goes against  their  interest.  Seems
it stupid to do that? Well, that is what industry are doing now.





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]


We have such a thing in Spain, and they have  put  also  free  of  copyright
content on their database and are charging for it, yes, they  sell  licenses
of copyright free books.


Like I said above, all content that is older than 6 months  should  be  free
for private use. That will generate  more  content  that  the  industry  can
sell. Do you explain me how it is possible that Disney takes  free  content,
does a movie about it, and then nobody  can  write  nothing  or  do  nothing
relevant taking that free content as base? It’s like Candy Crush Saga,  they
have copied the game form others and now whoever tries to do something  like
their game (copied previously from others) will  be  sued.  Copyrights  laws
are going too far,  if  they  continue  so  they  will  destruct  their  own
industry (like banks with their greediness).


Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of  50 years after the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter


Shorter, of course. Like I said above,  6  months  and  no  longer  (a  book
usually sells the first three months. What’s the use of  have  a  protection
for 70 years? The same applies to music, movies, etc.). For  what  will  the
rightholder keep the copyright of a book (or any other content) for so  long
if after 6 months it will sell nothing more. That content can be  the  basis
for new content, ideas, that the rightholder of the first idea can then  use
for a new idea, and so on. That will generate a big amount  of  new  content
periodically and make the industry grow.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain


Less is more. Less restrictions for the use is better for the users and  the
market. Free content generates much more new content  and  innovations  than
restrictive content. More content is more movement,  and  more  movement  is
more innovation and more jobs and money.


€ NO OPINION


  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain


No. Like I said above, the restrictions are only killing the  market.  There
is a anecdote: in a convention a musician asked to the public  how  much  of
them bought his disk, and only a dozen persons raised  the  hands;  then  he
asked how much downloaded the disk for free (piracy), and the  rest  of  the
auditorium raised their hands. And then he said: and  all  of  you  are  now
here buying my merchandising, thanks.


If the disk have been only available legally, only  a  dozen  persons  would
have been there buying his merchandising and  only  that  dozen  would  have
known him.


What the industry calls piracy is nothing more than free  advertisement  for
them, like videoclips in youtube. Artist get so more famous and  people  get
to knew them, and that makes them sell all the products that otherwise  they
wouldn’t have sold.


Maybe be now you are thinking I’m saying only bullshit,  well,  here  is  an
article                that                 illustrates                 all:

€ NO OPINION



  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]


There should be no limitations, only several options  for  the  rightholder,
like:


- Full copyright (no copy, no use of any part of the work in any case).


-  Free  for  personal/private  use  (but  not  for  public  and   lucrative
purposes).


- Free for translating and therefore also free disposal  of  the  translated
work.


- Free to use for personal/private use,  and  if  for  public  or  lucrative
purposes mandatory mentioning of the author.


- Etc…


  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why


The  limitations  are  killing  the  market,  destroying  new  markets   and
opportunities.


€ NO – Please explain why

  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

And add a full copyright protection license, for no  copy  and  no  nothing,
only available if you buy it and only for your personal use.


  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to


Why should I not enjoy the talent  and  culture  of  other  countries?  It’s
supposed that the EU is an open  market  and  with  the  possibility  to  go
freely everywhere. So, with the internet, I don’t need to go  physically  to
these country’s, I can enjoy them from my house.


€ NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to

€ NO OPINION


  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]

Why should be  there  compensations?  If  I  discover  the  books  of  Terry
Pratchett (for example), why should Spain compensate the  UK?  They  gain  a
customer that otherwise they wouldn’t have, they gain money. There are  only
the tax thing left, but for that there are already laws.


Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[41] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[42].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[43].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

The solution is explained above. Digital content of new works  will  be  not
available during the first 6 months  after  the  publication  of  the  work.
After these 6 months, the digital works can be  included  in  the  libraries
and archives. Meantime in these  6  months,  the  works  can  be  physically
included in the libraries and archives under the actual rules.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

[Open question]

I don’t see the problem on leaving all people  all  around  the  world  free
access to that content. Lots of countries would beneficiate of it and  would
be easier for them to eradicate illiteracy and  that  would  help  the  poor
countries to develop (despite the fact that a literate  country  will  claim
for their fundamental rights and seeking for peace −democracy).

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[44].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[45].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including

Eliminating the need of licensing for educational purposes, for  educational
purposes all  the  works  should  be  freely  available.  It  would  benefit
rightholders, it’s free advertising for them, students will knew their  work
and surely they will buy it for personal use or mention the authors  of  the
works they studied in their own works (more free advertising).  Millions  of
people will knew their work and will buy it for themselves.

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [49].

The Marrakesh Treaty[50] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[51] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[52].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when
      trying to use text or data mining methods, including across borders?

data mining methods, including across borders?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced

It is extremely rare that an end user uses data mining. Data mining is  used
usually for commercial purposes by  companies.  The  most  large  amount  of
information is created by end users, individual people, and that content  is
usually free. But then we get these  companies  that  data  mines  all  that
information and use it for commercial purposes. Of course, they  claim  that
the content created be these individuals are free of license  and  therefore
of free use for any purposes; and of course, all what they obtain thanks  to
all that free content is licensed, copyright protected and  in  awaiting  to
produce revenues. Put in short (companies point of view): I want to get  the
content for free, but what I create thanks to it must be paid for.


All very moral and ethical (ironic).

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[53]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[54].

      across borders?

existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or

€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


When you put music in a video and the rightholder want’s that  video  erased
(youtube). The thing is, that it was a no known author. But, that video  got
viral and made him famous. Curios. You can see everyday  people  asking  for
what song is playing  on  the  video  (songs  form  famous  and  not  famous
artists), and so much people get to  know  the  artists.  That  UGC  creates
feedback for the rightholders, more visits, more sales, more benefits.


I think the only law that should be created is  to  oblige  to  mention  the
original author. In  youtube  case,  for  example,  put  that  info  in  the

  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[55]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[56][57].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[58]  in
      the digital environment?

levies.

  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[59]

€ YES – Please explain

€ NO – Please explain


Why should I pay for the right to use  something  in  multiple  devices?  Do
rightholders pay for every street where they drive? No, they  pay  a  single
tax to be able to drive in all the streets of the country. So,  I  will  pay
one time and hear/watch the song/movie on the multiple devices I want.


It’s like if cloth industry pretends that I buy new clothes for every  house
I have instead of taking them with me from house to house.


€ NO OPINION


  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services  (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing  allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]


If the DVD/CD of the movie/songs break, will the rightholder give me  a  new
DVD/CD for free? No. So I will make copies and put them where  I  want,  and
of course without paying levies.


Any restrictions will kill a market. Restriction to backups on the  cloud  =
market kill. Restrictions on online content  =  internet  connection  market
kill (for what do I want a fast connection with all  those  restriction  and
levies? No, I just will need a normal connection, and it’s cheaper. Say  bye
bye to the progress and investigation).




  67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
      for products subject to levies?[60]

€ YES – Please explain


So people can see the amount of extra  money  they  pay  on  levies  for  no
purposes or valid justification. They will send the rightholders to “to  fry
asparagus” (Spanish expression = to hell). Let’s  see  the  incomes  of  the
rightholders after that.

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[61].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

€ YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate  the  percentage
of the undue payments. Please also indicate how a  priori  exemption  and/or
ex post reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.

  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….



  70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
      affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
      reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
      the situation?

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….



  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?


[Open question]


They will be solved be eliminating the levies. As you see  yourself,  levies
are only extra incomes for the only purpose  to  get  extra  money  for  the
rightholders in general and for the Copyright societies in particular.  Just
read above.


Levies are justified if the work will be used for  lucrative  purposes,  but
for not lucrative purposes levies should not exist.


   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[62] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[63]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

[Open question]
Removing intermediates. Discographies  and  the  Copyright  Societies.  Just
create a web page where the musicians can upload their works, put  a  price,
and that the incomes get directly to them. Amazon does it  with  books.  Why
not create a free webpage at EU  level  where  a  small  percentage  of  the
revenues of  the  artists  goes  to  maintain  the  service?  The  same  for
books/movies, etc…

  73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?

€ YES – Please explain


Of course, there are publishing houses that made you a contract  where  they
will get all the incomes of the first year and al  the  incomes  that  comes
afterwards are for you (of course, after the first 3  months  there  are  no
incomes, so they get all the money and  you  nothing).  And  of  course  the
publishing houses want all the rights, that should be prohibited.


€ NO – Please explain why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION


  74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what  would
      you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

[Open question]

Create standard contract laws that protects the authors,  and  prohibit  the
abusive clauses and scams of the publishing houses. Also the  protection  of
the rights that authors have over his work, so that  the  publishing  houses
can’t abuse them.


  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[64] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[65].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[66]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[67].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

€ YES – Please explain


You could create an online system that generates  a  code  of  any  work  or
publication (if the author wants to use it). So,  if  a  webpage  uses  that
content for commercial purposes I can prove easily that he has used my  work
and he will be obliged to pay my work  and  a  fine  (the  fine  can  go  to
maintain al the system). The system should  be  able  to  leave  you  select
different licensing systems.


€ NO – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION


  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….



  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain


Companies are collecting constantly private date  for  commercial  purposes.
The thing is, or you accept  the  abusive  rules  or  you  don’t  use  their
services. There should be scalable options where you  could  check  how  far
you want to go depending on the  services  you  need  of  the  program.  For
example, Facebook, there should be a page  in  the  registration  where  you
could check the services you want and the impact that it will have  in  your
privacy, and of course if it is necessary for the providing of the  service,
so you just use what you really need lowering the impact.


It’s like the last actualization of Facebook for smartphones, now  it  wants
rights/permissions to read your SMS/MMS. There should  be  an  option  where
you can see for what purpose they want that new  right  and  a  checkbox  to
mark if you want that new service or not. So  you  can  have  just  a  basic
Facebook to read the walls and write on them only, or  you  can  check  more
options to have more services.


Also it should be checked if these rights/permissions are necessary for  the
purpose  of  the  service,  like  a  flash  lamp  for  Android  that   wants
permissions to use your GPS, read your SMS, your  ID  device,  contacts  and
use freely the internet connection, and it is supposed to be  a  program  to
only activate and deactivate the flashlight of the smartpone.


Abusive clauses with  no  functional  purpose  for  the  service  should  be
prohibited.


€ NO OPINION


 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

It should be done fast and good. There are member states  that  are  abusing
introducing restrictive laws that will only kill the market.


VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[Open question]

The price of the products are  too  high.  Game  industry  said  piracy  was
killing their market, but here comes Valve (Steam  platform)  and  the  game
industry claims Valve saved their market. How?  With  constantly  discounts,
up to 80% discounts. That are attractive and fair prices.


So, one of the big problems of the piracy are the high prices.








Then we have another problem, the pay methods.  All  the  pay  methods  have
associated a credit card or a bank account. Lots of  people  are  afraid  of
the security or the privacy. Lots of people prefer the anonymous pays,  like
they do every day, like they are done millions of times every day, that  is,
paying in cash.


[It’s like Whatsapp, you can only buy a subscription with credit card.  What
about people that can’t or will not use a credit card?  Why  not  include  a
Premium SMS payment? People will not care if they will  pay  the  double  be
using the Premium SMS service. Be not introducing  that  service  there  are
millions of people using another App  instead  of  Whatsapp.  What  industry
says?: “Those cheap bastards are changing to another App instead  of  paying
only the 0,89€ that cost’s the service for one  year”.  The  truth  is  that
people are willing to pay but there is only the credit  card  option  to  do
it.]


But how to do it via internet? Be creating an anonymous credit card  with  a
300€ (for example) limit. It would function in this way:


1.- You go to the bank, post office, etc. and buy a credit card  for  2€  or
so and without maintenance fee. The credit card will have  only  the  credit
card number and two codes: a pin code and a check code. The  pin  code  will
be used like the traditional one, the check code will be used to check  your
balance and to load the credit card with cash.


2.- Now, you got a credit card, but now you need to activate it. You load  a
webpage and you introduce the credit card number with the check code  (check
code and pin will be created randomly and not based  in  an  algorithm  with
the credit card number as base, so hackers will not be able to discover  the
codes). Once you have entered the info on the  webpage  your  card  will  be
activated and registered, you will be  able  to  create  a  nickname  and  a
password and also to change your pin and check code, and also  you  will  be
able to see all what you have paid with the card.


3.- Loading the credit card with cash. There  could  be  different  ways  to
load your credit card:


Introducing the pin of a  paysafecard  (https://www.paysafecard.com/en-ie/),
getting a document with a pin code in your bank, post office  or  where  you
go to recharge your prepaid phone card. Once you get the pin  code,  you  go
to the webpage and introduce the credit card number (or nickname),  the  pin
code of the cash load and the check  code,  so  your  credit  card  will  be
loaded with cash.


4.- What happens if someone steals your credit card? Then you only  need  to
go to the webpage, introduce the credit card number (or  nickname)  and  you
password, and then push the that says “My credit card has been stolen”.  So,
your credit card will be immediately deactivated,  and  if  the  robber  has
used it, then you can see what he has bought,  where  and  when  (so  police
will have it easy to trap the robber). What can you do next? You  only  need
to go to a bank and buy a new credit card for  2€,  activate  it,  and  then
login in your old credit card and generate a pin code. With  that  pin  code
you will go to  your  new  credit  card  and  introduce  it  like  a  normal
recharge, and all the money you has in  your  stolen  credit  card  will  be
transferred to your new credit card. The pin code for the transference  will
be generated one hour later after the request. Why? No  robber  will  retain
you one hour to steal a maximum of 300€, and retain a person is a crime,  so
it will not be a simple misdemeanour for stealing only 300€ (max), but  also
a crime for retaining a person for an hour. A robber would not risk that.


There are lots of advantages of using this credit card:


a) You will be able to buy anonymously on internet (like  when  you  pay  by
cash in any establishment), and the credit card is not  bounded  to  a  bank
account.


b) It could be used to pay in any establishment. It  would  be  much  saver.
Robbers would not be able to steal cash, only a plastic card that they  will
not be able to use (and the owner only needs to deactivate  it,  buy  a  new
one for 2€, and generate a pin code to transfer the cash of the stolen  card
to reload the new one). Much more secure also for tourists all over Europe.


Any establishment could have a terminal to  be  able  to  operate  with  the
cards. They will only need a 50€ smartphone with  a  credit  card  slot.  So
they will be able to charge what people buy them.








An other idea is to create a  European  Netflix.  That  all  the  public  TV
series, movies, etc, created in any European country could  be  shared  with
any European country.


The only thing is  that  each  audio-visual  content  should  have  at  last
subtitles of the country  that  shares  the  content.  So,  there  could  be
official subtitles for the content in a country  or  some  particular  could
translate the subtitles for his country.


So, in Spain we could see a UK TV series with  official  Spanish  subtitles,
and if there are not official Spanish subtitles then  any  particular  could
translate them to Spanish, for example.


What do we get with that? Several things:


a) People would learn foreign languages. That  would  make  the  interaction
with European tourists much easier. And it would make  it  easier  also  for
European people to travel to any European country  just  for  fun,  studies,
work, etc.


b) People would see the architecture,  gastronomy,  etc.  of  the  different
countries in the audio-visual  content.  That  would  improve  the  tourism.
There should be a info panel in the audio-visual content selector where  you
could see where the TV series (movie, etc.)  has been filmed, what they  are
eating, etc., and links to documentals of the locations  and  food.  Like  y
said, that would improve tourism between European  countries  and  open  new
markets for local gastronomy in other countries.


c) It would  also  make  know  us  better,  the  culture  of  the  different
countries. That would make all countries closer.

so-called “neighbouring rights”  in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[20] The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or  indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[21] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to

Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable

[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[30] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain

currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
