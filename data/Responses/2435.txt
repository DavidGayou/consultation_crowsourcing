EuropeanaPhotography Response to the public consultation
for the copyright rules

EuropeanaPhotography (European ancient photographic vintage repositories of digitized
pictures of historical quality – CIP-ICT-PSP-2011-5/297158) is a EU-funded digitization
project aimed at enriching Europeana with masterpieces of early photography provided by a
public-private partner consortium (see http://www.europeana-photography.eu).



The following comments are strongly linked with the relevant response of Europeana to the
public consultation.



EuropeanaPhotography supports Europeana's response to sections I & II the EC copyright
consultation save for the following points:



Question 11: Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorization of the rights holder?



Yes it should in the circumstances where linking is used for what amounts to reproduction /
representation acts.



II.C Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?



Question 15 / 16 /17
The creation of a registration system at EU level might indeed help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter. However it should in no way be mandatory.



II.E Term of protection – is it appropriate?



Question 20: Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?



Yes as far as original works are concerned.

Some degree of protection should however be extended to digital copies of original works to
the benefit of the institutions which hold & digitize such works.



Question 21: Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?



There are indeed problems arising from that fact but unification in that regard is likely to
have a severe impact on the member states' respective cultural & heritage policies which
might be detrimental to member's states cultural diversity.



Question 22: Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a
need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?



No, with the exception of a possible "fair use" exception which we believe would be beneficial
to have defined at a European level. An appropriate approach to the "fair use" might be the
"Fair Dealing" already applied in the UK.




Question 23: Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
No, again save for a possible "fair use" exception which should specifically exclude any
commercial or marketable uses (including cultural & educational). The UK's "Fair Dealing" is
an appropriate approach towards this goal.



Question 24: Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a
greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?



No



From section III onwards, no consensus on a response could be reached due to the diversity
of structures making up the consortium, therefore EuropeanaPhotography as a group does
not support Europeana's position on section III & further.
