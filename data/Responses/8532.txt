REVIEW OF THE EU COPYRIGHT RULES

Response  from  the  Newspaper  Society   and   THE   Newspaper   Publishers
Association

Introduction

The  Newspaper  Society  (NS)  represents  and  promotes  the  interests  of
Britain's regional and local media.  As well as 1,100 core daily and  weekly
titles the regional press  offers  1,700  companion  websites,  hundreds  of
niche and ultra  local  publications  and  a  range  of  other  digital  and
broadcast channels. It delivers local news and  information  to  30  million
print readers  every  week  and  79  million  web  users  every  month.  The
Newspaper Publishers  Association  (NPA)  is  the  association  for  British
national newspapers. Its current members are Associated Newspapers,  Evening
Standard, Guardian News & Media, Independent Newspapers (UK),  MGN  (Trinity
Mirror national titles), News UK and Telegraph Media  Group.  National  news
brands reach 22 million adults a day.
Both the NS and the  NPA  are  active  members  of  the  European  Newspaper
Publishers Association (ENPA), which represents over 5,200 newspaper  titles
across the EU.   ENPA has maintained a presence  in  Brussels  for  over  50
years,  and  has  spearheaded  newspaper  industry  representations  on   EU
proposals relating to copyright, database,  and  digital  rights  management
issues.    ENPA’s  Copyright  Group  is  chaired  by  Sarah   Davis,   Group
Commercial Legal Director at Guardian Media Group.  We  support  the  points
made in ENPA’s separate submission paper.

I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

B.  Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to
be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

3.  Linking and browsing

Q12. Should the viewing of a  web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright  on
the screen and in the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s  computer,  either  in
general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation  of
the rightholder?

YES

The  Consultation  makes  reference  to  Case  C-360/13  (Public   Relations
Consultants Association Ltd), which ensues  from  the  decision  of  the  UK
Supreme Court in April 2013 to the effect that if a  customer  merely  views
material on website then that is covered by the temporary or transient  copy
exception under Article 5.1 of the Infosoc Directive.

We do not accept the proposition that  the  exception  applies  to  targeted
viewing in a commercial context  of  material  on  a  website.   This  would
conflict with the  normal  exploitation  of  the  work  and/or  unreasonably
prejudice the legitimate interests of the rights-holder.  We share the  view
of Mrs Justice Proudman, expounded at paragraph 109 of The NLA  v  Meltwater
Holding BV [2010] EWHC 3099 (Ch,)  that  “The  exception  cannot  have  been
intended to legitimise all copies made in the course of  browsing  or  users
would be permitted to watch pirated films  and  listen  to  pirated  music”.
Rights-holders will be left to pursue  the  operators  of  illegal  websites
(who are often located beyond the EU  and  so  difficult  and  expensive  to
pursue)  and/or  internet  service  providers  (where  obtaining   ‘blocking
injunctions’ can be  time  and  cost-intensive  with  no  guarantee  of  the
resulting injunction –  if  granted  –  not  being  easily  circumvented  by
technological  means).    To  quote  Mrs  Justice  Proudman,  “The  kind  of
circumstance where the defence may be available is where the purpose of  the
copying is to enable efficient  transmission  in  a  network  between  third
parties by an intermediary, typically an internet service provider”.

If the Supreme  Court  decision  is  confirmed  the  consequences  could  be
significant.  As highlighted by NLA Media Access in their response  to  this
Consultation, “A newspaper publisher might….wish to  allow  members  of  the
public to freely view its website for non-commercial use  while  precluding,
or charging a licence fee for, any commercial use.  Copyright  provides  the
legal basis for the publisher to preclude that use  or  make  that  charge”.
If a newspaper is obliged to go  behind  a  paywall  in  order  to  monetise
commercial use of its content by  the  minority,  “it  will  mean  that  the
majority of people who read/view its  website  for  non-commercial  purposes
will no longer have free online access to that content.  That  could  result
in the general public at large being denied free access to news and  current
affairs simply because a small minority of users  seek  to  make  commercial
use of publisher content”.


II.  Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

Q21.  Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
the existing catalogue?  Please explain by referring to specific cases.

NO

The current list of exceptions and limitations was the  subject  of  intense
discussion  and   negotiation   involving   all   stakeholders.    Newspaper
publishers regard this list as  providing  an  appropriate  balance  between
users and rightholders in terms of rights and exceptions.

Q24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide  for
a  greater  degree  of  flexibility  in  the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
limitations and exceptions?

NO

Q25. If yes, what would be the best approach  to  provide  for  flexibility?
(e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic  revisions  of
the directives, interpretations by  the  Commission,  built-in  flexibility,
e.g. in the form of a fair-use  or  fair  dealing  provision  /  open  norm,
etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative  advantages  and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its  possible  effects  on  the
functioning of the Internal Market.

The fundamental importance of clear  definitions  in  copyright  legislation
brings to the fore concerns over the  adoption  of  a  ‘fair  use  doctrine’
approach to the application of copyright exceptions.

We believe that fair use has considerable  disadvantages  and  deficiencies.
It  is  a  vague  test  which  fosters  expensive  litigation   (since   its
interpretation  depends  to  a  large   degree   on   a   judge’s   personal
perspective).   It  is  widely  recognised  that  the   doctrine’s   context
sensitivity renders it of little  value  to  those  who  require  reasonable
certainty about the legality of a proposed use.   The  US  Copyright  Office
itself  has  cautioned  that  the  “distinction   between   fair   use   and
infringement may be unclear and not easily defined”,  and  there  have  been
calls for Congress to clarify the scope of fair use  by  rendering  it  more
‘rule-like’.

The US copyright framework has a number of  unique  elements  which  do  not
feature in EU law, and which act as  a  counterpoint  to  fair  use.   These
include the common law doctrine of ‘hot news’ which  acknowledges  a  quasi-
property right in the news that a company has gathered, that enures  against
competitors.   U.S. copyright law gives successful  plaintiffs  the  ability
to elect  to  receive  an  award  of  statutory  damages  in  copyright  and
trademark  cases.   This  allows  courts  to  award  damages  based   on   a
straightforward monetary scale  or  a  multiple  of  the  legitimate  retail
price.  It is suggested that pre-established damages act as a  deterrent  to
infringement.  We are concerned that currently the UK courts  do  not  award
damages sufficient to discourage misuse.

It is arguable  that  the  US  fair  use  exception  contravenes  the  Berne
Convention's ‘three-step test’ because it is  too  broad  to  qualify  as  a
‘special case’ [Art 9(2)(a)].  It does not comply with  Art.  5  of  InfoSoc
Directive 2001/29/EC.  Furthermore,  it  would  not  comply  with  the  UK’s
international treaty obligations; in a  ruling  on  whether  Section  110(5)
USCA complied with the TRIPS Agreement,  the  WTO  Panel  held  that  art.13
TRIPS requires exceptions in national legislation to be clearly defined  and
narrow in scope  [see  WTO,  United  States  –  Section  110(5)  of  the  US
Copyright Act, Report of the  Panel  on  15  June  2000,  WT/DS160/R].    In
addition, the unlimited potential scope of users who can rely  on  the  fair
use doctrine renders it insufficiently limited in its ambit to constitute  a
‘certain special case’.

A.  Access to content in libraries and archives

1. Preservation and archiving

Q28. (b) [In particular if you are a right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

YES

Publishers are keen to facilitate the preservation of works  for  posterity.
However, preservation, storage and access must be conducted in  a  way  that
is compatible with  the  commercial  interests  and  sustainability  of  the
publishing  industry.   Many  newspaper  publishers  have  made  substantial
investments   in   developing   searchable   archives   of   their   digital
publications.   A  significant  number  of  NS  and  NPA  members  currently
maintain such assets,  necessitating  substantial  investment  in  terms  of
time, people and money.  Our members must be able  to  retain  control  over
whether or not their content is made available  to  third  parties,  and  to
protect their revenue streams.

In March 2010 the British Library entered into a ten-year  partnership  with
online publisher BrightSolid, whereby up to 40 million historic  pages  from
the national newspaper collection were digitised.  This collection had  been
amassed via material deposited under the legal  deposit  legislation,  which
has existed in English law since 1662.

Regardless of whether or not material they hold is out of copyright, it  was
gifted to the legal deposit libraries (LDLs) by publishers as  a  matter  of
legal obligation. By using that material to create a commercial  opportunity
for BrightSolid, and in turn  use  that  commercial  opportunity  to  offset
their  own  costs  (thereby  indirectly  using  commercial  exploitation  of
content to fund  their  core  mission),  they  abused  the  privilege  which
garnered the material in the first place.  Legal  deposit  has  a  specific,
narrow purpose.  The Library copy is there to secure the  UK's  intellectual
and cultural record for posterity, to stop items vanishing  from  the  world
and to help those who need it to  find  information  when  all  else  fails.
Legal  deposit  collections  were  not  envisaged  as  an   alternative   to
publishers’ own  supply  channels.  However,  by  allowing  BrightSolid  the
facility  to  deliver  a  comprehensive  resource  that  undercuts  that  of
publishers they  were  given  a  dominant  and  protected  position  in  the
marketplace.  Their offering cannot be  emulated  by  individual  publishers
because the BL entered into non-compete restrictions with BrightSolid.


29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Digitisation of copyright works for preservation  purposes  should  only  be
permitted with additional safeguards, including express stipulation that:

• the number of  copies  made  is  limited  to  those  that  are  reasonably
necessary to create and  maintain  a  copy  of  the  work  for  preservation
purposes
• the library or archive restricts access  to  the  preservation  copies  to
that which is necessary to maintain and preserve the work
•  preservation  copies  must  be  maintained  in  a  secure,  managed,  and
monitored environment
• any copy that is made in digital format  is  not  made  available  to  the
public in that format outside the premises of the  library  or  archive  (ie
remotely to users)
• no circumvention of technological protection measures

Newspaper companies must be able to  retain  control  over  whether  or  not
their content is made available to  third  parties,  and  to  protect  their
revenue  streams.  This  has  been  recognised  in  the   context   of   the
consultation  on  the  Legal  Deposit  Libraries  Regulations  2013,   which
preclude the deposit  libraries  from  selling  copies  of  non-print  works
obtained under the legal deposit regime, even on expiry of the copyright  in
those works.

30. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary  institutions  should
be covered and under which conditions?

31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


2.   Off-premises access to library collections

32. (c) [In particular if you are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across  borders,  to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

NO

The UK’s Legal Deposit Regulations 2013 provide that access to the same non-
print work is restricted to one display terminal at any one time in each  of
the  Legal  Deposit  Libraries.   This  mirrors  the  system   for   printed
publications whereby a maximum of six copies of the same work are  available
for readers across the six Legal Deposit Libraries.     Publishers  required
to deposit works are essentially giving up part of their  prerogative  under
copyright to exploit works and benefit from the investment they  have  made.
To minimise this loss access  to  all  archived  works  is  limited  to  the
physical premises of the Libraries.

This is imperative, in light of the greatly increased risks that  publishers
face in the digital environment. Online newspapers  are  highly  susceptible
to unauthorised copying and onward exploitation, with concomitant damage  to
publishers’ commercial interests.  It is vital, therefore,  that  there  are
sufficient  safeguards  in  the  legislation  to  guard   against   ‘digital
leakage’, so that publishers can have full confidence  in  the  security  of
the system.  Given the practices engaged  in  by  a  significant  number  of
Internet users, remote access could  facilitate  uncontrolled  dissemination
and would not meet the conditions of  the  Berne  three-step  test.   Access
constraints and the communication of what  constitutes  acceptable  use  can
best be achieved via fixed terminals on library premises, which can  be  set
up to block attempted downloads and will  not  have  peer-to-peer  software.



33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

34. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary  institutions  should
be covered and under which conditions?

35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
Remote  access  to  the  NLA  Media  Access  eClips  database  is  generally
available online via ClipSearch, which enables article search  and  paid-for
copying of selected  articles  from  most  eClips  titles.   Licensing  news
content  permits  the  funding  of  high-quality  journalism   and   content
production, which is in the  long-term  interests  of  all  members  of  the
digital marketplace and society in general.
The BL consider that the ClipSearch service does not have the  functionality
sought  in order to replicate the Reading Room experience for  its  members.
 In order to  meet  that  requirement,  and  potentially  to  permit  remote
access, NLA Media Access engaged last year in discussions over  designing  a
bespoke online service for BL users.   This project has had to be  suspended
due to government budget cuts and a lack of research into  the  requirements
and likely demand levels from BL Reading  Room  members,  which  would  have
implications for design and resourcing.


MASS DIGITISATION

40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting  to
engage  in  mass  digitisation  projects,  a  right  holder,  a   collective
management organisation:] Would it be necessary in  your  country  to  enact
legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the  agreements
concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have  a  cross-border
effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

There  are,  quite  simply,   no   'out-of-commerce'   newspaper   archives.
Newspaper publishers have made substantial investments in digital  offerings
and in developing innovative business models.   Their  back  catalogues  are
digitised and  made  available  via  online  archives  and  databases  on  a
commercial basis.

TEXT AND DATA MINING

53. (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

In our view there is no  convincing  evidence  that  TDM  is  being  blocked
either by current copyright  law  or  by  publishers  themselves.    On  the
contrary, licenses are available which make works accessible at low cost  on
terms that respect the interests of rightsholders.  Licensing solutions  are
able to take account of security and  integrity  concerns,  and  of  matters
necessitating commercial judgment.  The Journal Article Mining study,  which
was commissioned by the Publishing Research Consortium, found that over  90%
of   publisher   respondents   grant   research-focused   mining    requests
(approximately 60% of these in most or  all  cases,  another  33%  for  some
cases).  Only 12% of requests are turned down, on the basis of  questionable
bona fides of the applicant; “Publishers tend to treat mining requests  from
third parties in a liberal way, certainly so  for  mining  requests  with  a
research purpose.  Publishers are less permissive if the mining results  can
replace  or  compete  with  the  original  content”.  Unmanaged  access  has
attendant  risks  of  widespread  copyright  infringement,  placing   entire
databases of copyright material at risk.

54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

55. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements?  Which  activities  should  be  covered  and  under  what
conditions?

56. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

Licensing of text and  data  mining  is  a  nascent  marketplace  which  has
potential as a  source  of  revenue  for  rightsholders.  For  example,  the
research study Journal Article Mining (May 2011), notes  that  “A  very  new
group  of  users  is  found  among  marketeers,  advertisers  and   business
analysts”.  From the survey it is clear that  many  publishers  are  already
mining their own content; 46% of respondents indicated  that  this  was  the
case,  either for the creation of new products (57%), for better  navigation
through their content (82%), for the generation  of  metadata  (64%)  and/or
for internal purposes such as usage analysis (46%).   A high  percentage  of
publishers flagged up their intention to do so, particularly with a view  to
creating better browsing trails to related articles.  A  TDM  exception  has
the potential to infringe the Berne 3-step test as it  could  conflict  with
the normal exploitation of publishers’ archives.

During  the  ‘Licenses  for  Europe’  dialogue  the   publishing   community
reiterated  its  commitment  to  delivering  practical  and   workable   TDM
solutions to users.  Notably,  publishers  supported  the  proposal  by  the
International Association of Scientific Technical & Medical  Publishers  for
a model clause that could be included in access and subscription  agreements
for non-commercial research.  The industry also demonstrated its  capability
for  allowing  one-stop  access  via  the  CrossRef  project,  a   web-based
permission  tool.   The  meetings  of  WG4  were  productive  in  terms   of
identifying stakeholder challenges and generating a series  of  options  and
initiatives from publishers and RROs to address  them.   In  our  view  time
should be given for the progress achieved in WG4  to  be  further  developed
and tested by users.

57.  Are  there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

NO

FAIR REMUNERATION OF AUTHORS AND PERFORMERS

72. [In particular if  you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms)  to  ensure  that  you  receive  an
adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?

Newspapers report current events and generate  debate  on  important  social
issues.  Their role as a primary conduit for the free  flow  of  information
and comment is central to a properly functioning democracy.  To fulfil  this
role accurately and with authority publishers devote considerable  resources
to  their  news-gathering  operations.  The  IP  framework   is   profoundly
influential in establishing the environment  for  these  positive  outcomes.
Newspaper companies must be sure that  their  huge  economic  investment  is
underpinned by effective legal protection, so that they can be confident  of
their ability to use and disseminate the content created by them  and  their
employees in any appropriate way,  allowing  the  freedom  to  innovate  and
develop.

UK newspaper publishers are  strongly  of  the  view  that  ownership  under
statute of the copyright in employed journalists’ works – see section 11  of
the UK’s Copyright, Designs & Patents Act 1998 - is  a  key  issue.   It  is
crucial to our members both  from  an  operational  standpoint  and  from  a
commercial one, and reflects the legal risk assumed by  newspaper  companies
in respect  of  published  content.   Other  pertinent  provisions  are  the
various exceptions to the ‘paternity’ and  ‘integrity’  rights  which  apply
where a work is produced in the course of employment for  publication  in  a
newspaper, magazine or similar periodical or for the  purpose  of  reporting
current events.

These are all practical measures which recognise the exigencies  and  unique
characteristics of the newspaper business.  These include the  role  of  the
editor; the volume and diversity of content; constraints on space;  and  the
multi-contributor nature of newspapers.

The application of moral rights in the field of newspaper  publishing  could
severely inhibit the provision of a rapid and responsive news  service.   It
would also affect  the  development  of  newspaper  companies’  content  and
information services across media  platforms.   In  Continental  Europe  the
endorsement of the moral rights of the originator  (eg  author,  journalist,
illustrator) has  led  to  serious  constraints  on  the  ability  of  media
companies to adapt products to new digital channels.

The UK provisions  are  fair  to  all  stakeholders  and  are  effective  in
stimulating creativity  and  the  dissemination  of  creative  works.   They
exemplify  how  current  copyright  law  successfully  strikes  the  balance
between over-complicating  and  over-simplifying  matters,  recognising  the
widely differing models in the market and facilitating their coexistence.


73. Is there a need to act  at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?

NO

74. If you consider that the current rules are  not  effective,  what  would
you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?



RESPECT FOR RIGHTS

75. Should  the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
efficient  for  infringements  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
purpose?

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow  for
sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such   as   Internet   service
providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,  domain  name
registrars, etc.)  in  inhibiting  online  copyright  infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would  be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries?

77. Does the current civil  enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected  and
other rights such as the  protection  of  private  life  and  protection  of
personal data?


Effective IPR enforcement mechanisms are essential  to  combat  both  piracy
and parasitism, failing which there is a risk that the ‘virtuous circle’  of
investment,  returns  and  re-investment  will  be  undermined.   Unlicensed
republishing has a direct impact on content revenues, as well  as  resulting
in the indirect cost of lost audience for advertising.    In Q4 of 2013  NLA
Media Access trialled a copyright infringements service which  automatically
polled search engines to identify where text had been lifted from  newspaper
websites and re-published.    The  trial identified  some  800  examples  of
probable copying per day across the eight national UK publications. 
 
A prerequisite for an effective IP enforcement regime is reliable  evidence.
   ENPA has responded to the Consultation  on  the  Strategic  Plan  on  the
European  Observatory  on  Infringements  of  IP  Rights  (OHIM),  and   has
identified the three main priorities for its work programme as being:

1.   Primary  research  and  evidence  gathering.  Research  on  piracy  and
parasitism in the news media sector  would  also  help  to  broaden  the  IP
debate  from  the  sometimes-divisive  discussion   around   copyright   and
individual users, to a wider dialogue on the need for IP to be respected  by
all parties in the value chain.

2.  An examination of the economic  impact  on  publishers’  investments  as
well as the financial impact  and  long-term  consequences  for  society  of
unauthorised use of content by third parties, including aggregators,  search
engines and private companies, often for commercial gain.    Specific  areas
of focus should include:

   i)  Mapping  initiatives  being  taken  to  outline  the  scale  of   IPR
      infringements in the newspaper and news media sector;
  ii) Evidence gathering and impact analysis of the investment and financial
      damage of misuse of newspaper content;
 iii) Taking into consideration the special character and importance of  the
      independent press sector and its  investment  in  professionalism,  as
      well as its contribution to media pluralism and diversity, there is  a
      particular need for adequate IP protection.

3.  Facilitation of appropriate  public  awareness  campaigns  in  order  to
foster a better understanding of IP.
