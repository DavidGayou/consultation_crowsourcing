            Introduction<br/>

            Context of the consultation<br/>

            Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet<br/>
            have reshaped the ways in which content is created,distributed,<br/>
            and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that<br/>
            create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for<br/>
            new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such<br/>
            as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens<br/>
            who now expect to be able to access content – for information,<br/>
            education or entertainment purposes – regardless of<br/>
            geographical borders.<br/>

            This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is<br/>
            for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of<br/>
            distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to<br/>
            ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and<br/>
            enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new<br/>
            environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these<br/>
            challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework<br/>
            stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support<br/>
            creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single<br/>
            Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote<br/>
            cultural diversity.<br/>

            In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1<br/>

            COM (2012)789 final, 18/12/2012.<br/>

            the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action:on the one<br/>
            hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to<br/>
            modernise the EU copyright legislative framework2<br/>

            As announced in the Intellectual Property Strategy ' A single<br/>
            market for Intellectual Property Rights: COM (2011)287 final,<br/>
            24/05/2011.<br/>

            3<br/>

            "Based on market studies and impact assessment and legal<br/>
            drafting work"as announced in the Communication (2012)789.<br/>

            with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table<br/>
            legislative reform proposals, andon the other, to facilitate<br/>
            practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder<br/>
            dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid<br/>
            progresswas deemed necessary and possible.<br/>

            The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4<br/>

            See the document “Licences for Europe – tem pledges to bring<br/>
            more content<br/>
            online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.<br/>

            . The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders<br/>
            have put forward in this context and will monitor their<br/>
            progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four<br/>
            Working Groups (cross border portability of services,<br/>
            user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text<br/>
            and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these<br/>
            pledges to be a further step in making the user environment<br/>
            easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes<br/>
            note of the fact that two groups – user-generated content and<br/>
            text and datamining – did not reach consensus among<br/>
            participating stakeholders on either the problems to be<br/>
            addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of<br/>
            "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in the<br/>
            context of the review of the legislative framework.<br/>

            As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a<br/>
            public consultation on issues identified in the Communication on<br/>
            Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:"territoriality in<br/>
            the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions<br/>
            to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU<br/>
            copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness and<br/>
            efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in<br/>
            the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the<br/>
            October 2013 European CouncilConclusions5<br/>

            EUCO 169/13, 24/25 October 2013.<br/>

            "Providing digital services and content across the single market<br/>
            requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the digital<br/>
            age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review<br/>
            of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important<br/>
            to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate<br/>
            licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of<br/>
            intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural<br/>
            diversity".<br/>

            This consultation builds on previous consultations and public<br/>
            hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright<br/>
            in the knowledge economy"6<br/>

            COM(2008)<br/>
            466/3,http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/copyright-infso/index_en.htm#maincontentSec2.<br/>

            , the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual<br/>
            works"7<br/>

            COM(2011) 427<br/>
            final,http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2011/audiovisual_en.htm.<br/>

            and "Content Online"8<br/>

            http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2009/content_online_en.htm.<br/>

            . These consultations provided valuable feedback from<br/>
            stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as<br/>
            the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome<br/>
            territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination<br/>
            of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in<br/>
            the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders<br/>
            representing all stages in the value chain, including right<br/>
            holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions<br/>
            elicited widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The<br/>
            "Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was followed<br/>
            up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper on the<br/>
            online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into<br/>
            subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights Management<br/>
            Directive and into the current review process.<br/>

            Rights and the functioning of the Single Market<br/>

            Why is it not possible to access many online content services<br/>
            from anywhere in Europe?[The territorial scope of the rights<br/>
            involved in digital transmissions and thesegmentation of the<br/>
            market through licensing agreements]<br/>

            Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers,<br/>
            musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,<br/>
            they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights<br/>
            in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised<br/>
            by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and<br/>
            the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the<br/>
            territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus<br/>
            territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced<br/>
            on a country-by-country basis under national law9<br/>

            This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on<br/>
            several occasions.<br/>

            .<br/>

            The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet<br/>
            – e.g. by amusic streaming service, or by an online e-book<br/>
            seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for<br/>
            each national territory in which the content is communicated to<br/>
            the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant<br/>
            a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content<br/>
            services can be provided in several Member States and across<br/>
            borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to<br/>
            facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a<br/>
            Directive on Collective RightsManagement10<br/>

            Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the<br/>
            Council of 11 July 2012 on collective management of copyright<br/>
            and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in<br/>
            musical works for online uses in the internal market,COM(2012)<br/>
            372 final.<br/>

            should significantly facilitate the delivery of<br/>
            multi-territorial licences in musical works for online<br/>
            services11<br/>

            Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in<br/>
            the management of online rights for musical works incontrast to<br/>
            the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right<br/>
            holders such as film or record producers or by newspaper or book<br/>
            publishers.<br/>

            ; the structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences for Europe”12<br/>

            You can find more information on the following website:<br/>
            http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/.<br/>

            and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the<br/>
            Linked Content Coalition13<br/>

            You can find more information on the following<br/>
            website:http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org/.<br/>

            .<br/>

            "Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue<br/>
            of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers<br/>
            having subscribed to online services in their Member State to<br/>
            keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member<br/>
            States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector<br/>
            issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue<br/>
            working towardsthe further development of cross-border<br/>
            portability14<br/>

            See the document “Licences for Europe – tem pledges to bring<br/>
            more content<br/>

            .<br/>

            Despite progress, there are continued problems with the<br/>
            cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These<br/>
            problems are most obvious to consumers wantingto access<br/>
            services that are made available in Member States other than<br/>
            the one in which they live. Not all online services are<br/>
            available in all Member States and consumers face problems when<br/>
            trying to access such services across borders. In some<br/>
            instances, even if the “same” service is available in all<br/>
            Member States, consumers cannot access the service across<br/>
            borders (they can only access their “national” service, and if<br/>
            they try to access the "same" service in another Member State<br/>
            they are redirected to the one designated for their country of<br/>
            residence).<br/>

            This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of<br/>
            rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights<br/>
            in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing<br/>
            agreements between right holders and distributors and/or<br/>
            between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of<br/>
            some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).<br/>

            The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further<br/>
            measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led<br/>
            solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15<br/>

            Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what<br/>
            needs to be authorised (or not) in digital<br/>
            transmissions?[Thedefinition of the rights involved in digital<br/>
            transmissions]<br/>

            The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related<br/>
            rights in the digital environment is largely established by<br/>
            Directive 2001/29/EC16<br/>

            Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament andof the<br/>
            Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects<br/>
            of copyright and related rights in the information society.<br/>

            on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related<br/>
            rights in the information society. OtherEU directives in this<br/>
            field that are relevant in the online environment are those<br/>
            relating to the protection of software17<br/>

            Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the<br/>
            Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer<br/>
            programs.<br/>

            and databases18<br/>

            Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council<br/>
            of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.<br/>

            .<br/>

            Directive 2001/29/ECharmonises the rights of authors and<br/>
            neighbouring rightholders19<br/>

            Film and record producers, performers andbroadcasters are<br/>
            holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in, respectively,<br/>
            their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’<br/>
            content protected by copyright is referred to as a “work” or<br/>
            “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights<br/>
            isreferred to as “other subject matter”.<br/>

            which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of<br/>
            works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g.<br/>
            a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital<br/>
            networks.<br/>

            The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the<br/>
            reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the<br/>
            making of copies20<br/>

            The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect,<br/>
            temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any<br/>
            form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC)<br/>
            although temporary acts of reproduction of a transient or<br/>
            incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see<br/>
            art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).<br/>

            , (notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the<br/>
            uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of<br/>
            making it available – and at the users’ end – e.g. when a user<br/>
            downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to<br/>
            the public/making available right, i.e. the rights toauthorise<br/>
            or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital<br/>
            networks21<br/>

            The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the<br/>
            public by wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit<br/>
            the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3of<br/>
            Directive 2001/29/EC).<br/>

            . These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions<br/>
            and both need to be cleared.<br/>

            The act of “making available”<br/>

            Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neitherwhatis covered by the<br/>
            making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by<br/>
            the public, the actual reception by the public) norwherethe act<br/>
            of “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions<br/>
            if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise<br/>
            however when the transmission covers severalterritories and<br/>
            rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available"<br/>
            happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the<br/>
            countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each<br/>
            of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?).<br/>
            The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the<br/>
            European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the<br/>
            “targeting” ofa certain Member State's public22<br/>

            See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar)<br/>
            and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related rights, and<br/>
            Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to<br/>
            jurisdiction see also joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09<br/>
            (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez<br/>
            Hejduk); see however, adopting adifferent approach, Case<br/>
            C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).<br/>

            . According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which<br/>
            has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which<br/>
            are “targeted” by the online service provider. A service<br/>
            provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific<br/>
            country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via<br/>
            advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency<br/>
            specifically targeted at that group.<br/>

            Is the scope of the “making available” right incross-border<br/>
            situations – i.e. when content is disseminated across borders –<br/>
            sufficiently clear?<br/>

             YES<br/>

             NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what<br/>
            type of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"<br/>
            approach explained above, asin "country of origin" approach23<br/>

            The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is<br/>
            to localise the copyright relevant act that must be licenced in<br/>
            a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be<br/>
            for example the Member Statein which the content is uploaded or<br/>
            where the service provider is established), regardless of in how<br/>
            many Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an<br/>
            approach has already been introduced at EU level with regard to<br/>
            broadcasting by satellite(see Directive 93/83/EEC on the<br/>
            coordination of certain rules concerning copyright and rights<br/>
            related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and<br/>

            This means that there are two rights that apply to digital<br/>

            Download to own digital content<br/>

            Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital<br/>
            transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the<br/>
            possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this<br/>
            manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The<br/>
            principle of EUexhaustion of the distribution right applies in<br/>
            the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a<br/>
            tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the<br/>
            right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that<br/>
            tangible article)27<br/>

            See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.<br/>

            . The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also<br/>
            be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in<br/>
            its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the<br/>
            property of the copy)28<br/>

            InCase C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an<br/>
            author cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence that<br/>
            allows downloading his computer program from his website and<br/>
            using it for an unlimited period of time. The exclusive right<br/>
            of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such<br/>
            a licence is exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus<br/>
            admitted that the distribution right may be subject to<br/>
            exhaustion in case of computer programs offered for download<br/>
            with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to<br/>
            emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer<br/>
            Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule<br/>
            constituted alex specialisin relation to the Information<br/>
            Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).<br/>

            . This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the<br/>
            practical application of such an approach (how to avoid<br/>
            re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have<br/>
            “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the “forward and<br/>
            delete” question)as well as to the economic implications of the<br/>
            creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality<br/>
            that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market<br/>
            for physical goods).<br/>

            Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good<br/>
            idea?<br/>

            Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as<br/>
            the existing international treaties in the area prohibit<br/>
            formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise<br/>
            ofrights. However, this prohibition is not absolute29<br/>

            For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works<br/>
            originating in the country imposing the formalities as opposed<br/>
            to works originating in another country.<br/>

            . Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made<br/>
            compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and<br/>
            exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with<br/>
            the increased opportunities that digital technology provides<br/>
            for the use of content (including older works and works that<br/>
            otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and<br/>
            disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being<br/>
            considered30<br/>

            On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the<br/>
            European Parliament and of theCouncil of 25 October 2012 on<br/>
            certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible<br/>
            online database is currently being set up by the Office for<br/>

            How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers<br/>

            There are many private databases of works and other subject<br/>
            matter held by producers, collectivemanagement organisations,<br/>
            and institutions such as libraries, which are based to<br/>
            a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less)<br/>
            interoperable, internationally agreed ‘identifiers’.<br/>
            Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a<br/>
            work, are specific to the sector in which they have been<br/>
            developed31<br/>

            E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to<br/>
            identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number<br/>
            (ISBN) is used to identify books.<br/>

            , and identify, variously, thework itself, the owner or the<br/>
            contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are<br/>
            notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to<br/>
            improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases.<br/>
            The Global Repertoire Database32<br/>

            You willfind more information about this initiative on the<br/>

            Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types of<br/>

            and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing<br/>
            across different sectors.<br/>

            What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption<br/>
            of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the<br/>
            development and interoperability of rights ownership and<br/>
            permissionsdatabases?<br/>

            Term of protection – is it appropriate?<br/>

            Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for<br/>
            a limited period of time. After the term of protection has<br/>
            expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely<br/>
            used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national<br/>
            rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention35<br/>

            Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic<br/>
            Works,http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.<br/>

            requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the<br/>
            death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of<br/>
            protection to 70 years after the death ofthe author (as do many<br/>
            other countries, e.g. the US).<br/>

            With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram<br/>
            producers, the term provided for in the EU rules also extend 20<br/>
            years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,<br/>
            providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first<br/>
            publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual<br/>
            sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of<br/>
            protection.<br/>

            Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market<br/>

            Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights<br/>
            enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter,<br/>
            without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for<br/>
            certain purposes and toa certain extent (for instance the use<br/>
            for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a<br/>
            teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are<br/>
            established in a number of copyright directives, most notably<br/>
            Directive 2001/29/EC36<br/>

            Plus Directive 96/9/ECon the legal protection of<br/>
            databases;Directive 2009/24/ECon the legal protection of<br/>
            computer programs,and Directive 92/100/ECon rental right and<br/>
            lending right.<br/>

            .<br/>

            Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws<br/>
            have to respect international law37<br/>

            Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of<br/>
            Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of the TRIPS<br/>
            Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994;<br/>
            Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers and Phonograms<br/>
            Treaty(1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).<br/>

            . In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis<br/>
            requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in<br/>
            certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal<br/>
            exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not<br/>
            unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the<br/>
            rightholders.<br/>

            Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in<br/>
            EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the<br/>
            rights harmonised at EU level)38<br/>

            Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor<br/>
            importance for analogue uses existing in Member States at the<br/>
            time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).<br/>

            , these limitations and exceptions are often optional39<br/>

            With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer<br/>
            Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii)<br/>
            Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan<br/>
            Works Directive.<br/>

            , in the sense that Member States are free to reflect innational<br/>
            legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover,<br/>
            the formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions is<br/>
            general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member<br/>
            States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (ifthey<br/>
            decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of<br/>
            the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal<br/>
            framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in<br/>
            policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the<br/>
            functioning ofthe Single Market.<br/>

            In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the<br/>
            rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the<br/>
            territory of the Member State), the definition of the<br/>
            limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so<br/>
            an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"may<br/>
            still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move<br/>
            to the Member State "B")40<br/>

            Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works<br/>
            Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and related<br/>
            rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or<br/>
            cannot be located) has been given a cross-border effect, which<br/>
            means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a<br/>
            novel – is considered an orphan work in a Member State, that<br/>
            same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member<br/>
            States and can be used and accessed in all Member States.<br/>

            .<br/>

            The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also<br/>
            raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In<br/>
            some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate<br/>
            rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or<br/>
            exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are<br/>
            not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.<br/>
            If a limitation orexception triggering a mechanism of fair<br/>
            compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the<br/>
            books are used for illustration in an online course given by an<br/>
            university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a<br/>
            Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify<br/>
            which national law should determine the level of that<br/>
            compensation and who should pay it.<br/>

            Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being<br/>
            raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and<br/>
            Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary<br/>
            (either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an<br/>
            exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation<br/>
            of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether<br/>
            a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and<br/>
            Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required<br/>
            legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single<br/>
            Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.<br/>

            Are there problems arising from thefact that most limitations<br/>
            and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are<br/>
            optional for the Member States?<br/>

            Access to content in libraries and archives<br/>

            Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their<br/>
            national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the<br/>
            benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational<br/>
            establishments and museums, as well as archives. If<br/>
            implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and<br/>
            archiving41<br/>

            Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.<br/>

            and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject<br/>
            matter in the collections of such institutions42<br/>

            Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.<br/>

            . The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these<br/>
            establishments of physical copies of works and other subject<br/>
            matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43<br/>

            Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.<br/>

            .<br/>

            Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to<br/>
            achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be<br/>
            clarified or updated tocover use in digital networks. At the<br/>
            same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible<br/>
            expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject<br/>
            matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders.<br/>
            The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between<br/>
            different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.<br/>

            Preservation and archiving<br/>

            The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter<br/>
            held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g.<br/>
            books,records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of<br/>
            works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation<br/>
            of another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter.<br/>
            Most Member States provide for an exception in their national<br/>
            laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The<br/>
            scope of the exception differs from Member State to Member<br/>
            State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the<br/>
            types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the<br/>
            mode of copying and the number of reproductions that a<br/>
            beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal<br/>
            status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting<br/>
            and archiving publicly available web content) is often<br/>
            uncertain.<br/>

            Off-premises access to library collections<br/>

            Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation<br/>
            of works and other subject-matter (consulting ane-book,<br/>
            watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises<br/>
            of such establishments for the purpose of research and private<br/>
            study. The online consultation of works and other<br/>
            subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on<br/>
            the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is<br/>
            generally addressed in agreements between<br/>
            universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law<br/>
            rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to,<br/>

            E – lending<br/>

            Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of<br/>
            works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users.<br/>
            Recent technologicaldevelopments have made it technically<br/>
            possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access<br/>
            to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via<br/>
            networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to<br/>
            obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such<br/>
            e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and<br/>
            libraries are currently experimenting with different business<br/>
            models for the making available of works online, including<br/>
            direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling<br/>
            by aggregators.<br/>

            (a)[In particular if you are alibrary:]Have you experienced<br/>
            specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable<br/>

            Mass digitisation<br/>

            The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to<br/>
            efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to<br/>
            digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their<br/>
            collections with an objective to preserve thesecollections and,<br/>
            normally, to make them available to the public. Examples are<br/>
            efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of<br/>
            the 20thcentury or whole collections of pictures of historical<br/>
            value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by<br/>
            the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on<br/>
            the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works<br/>
            (i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of<br/>
            commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation<br/>
            efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of<br/>
            licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural<br/>
            institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies<br/>
            representing authors and publishers on the other44<br/>

            You will find more information about his MoU on the following<br/>
            website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm.<br/>

            . Provided the required funding isensured (digitisation projects<br/>
            are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that<br/>
            books that are currently to be found only in the archives of,<br/>
            for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available<br/>
            online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences<br/>
            (granted by Collective Management Organisations on the basis of<br/>
            the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some<br/>
            Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the<br/>
            largest possibleeffect of such licences (e.g. by establishing<br/>
            in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting<br/>
            society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the<br/>
            licences granted)45<br/>

            France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the<br/>
            effects of the MoU.The French act (LOIn° 2012-287 du 1er mars<br/>
            2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres<br/>
            indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees collective management,<br/>
            unless the author or publisher in question opposes such<br/>
            management.The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister<br/>
            undvergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des<br/>
            Urheberrechtsgesetzes vom 1.Oktober 2013) contains a legal<br/>
            presumption of representation by a collecting society in<br/>
            relation to works whose rightholders are not members of the<br/>
            collecting society.<br/>

            between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border<br/>

            Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.<br/>

            enables Member States to implement in their national legislation<br/>
            limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for<br/>
            non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow<br/>
            a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his<br/>
            course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or<br/>
            of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected<br/>
            content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation<br/>
            from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional)<br/>
            provision allows for rather different implementation at Member<br/>
            States level. The implementation of the exception differs from<br/>
            Member State to Member State, with several Member States<br/>

            Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by<br/>
            Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities,<br/>
            Marrakesh, June 17 to 28 2013.<br/>

            has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for<br/>
            persons who areblind, visually impaired, or otherwise print<br/>
            disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright<br/>
            that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute<br/>
            and make available accessible format copies to visually<br/>
            impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders.<br/>
            The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and<br/>
            ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain<br/>
            provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to<br/>
            exchange accessible format copies across borders).<br/>

            Text and data mining<br/>

            Text and datamining/content mining/data analytics51<br/>

            For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data<br/>
            mining” will be used.<br/>

            are different terms used to describe increasingly important<br/>
            techniques used in particular by researchers for the<br/>
            exploration ofvast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g.,<br/>
            journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of<br/>
            software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of<br/>
            relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights,<br/>
            patterns and trends.<br/>

            The textsand data used for mining are either freely accessible<br/>
            on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g.<br/>
            journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of<br/>
            publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g.<br/>
            on browser cachememories or in computers RAM memories or onto<br/>
            the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis.<br/>
            Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or<br/>
            other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation<br/>
            from the right holders for the making of such copies unless<br/>
            such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to<br/>
            general public without restrictions on the internet, open<br/>
            access).<br/>

            Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are<br/>
            covered by the exception fortemporary copies in Article 5.1 of<br/>
            Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining<br/>
            activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None<br/>
            of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does<br/>
            not consist only of a singlemethod, but can be undertaken in<br/>
            several different ways. Important questions also remain as to<br/>
            whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go<br/>
            beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain<br/>
            the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need<br/>
            to obtain “access” to content (i.e. being able to use e.g.<br/>
            commercial databases).<br/>

            A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the<br/>
            framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No<br/>
            consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either<br/>
            the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time,<br/>
            practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of<br/>
            subscription-based scientific content were presented by<br/>
            publishers as an outcome of “Licencesfor Europe”52<br/>

            See the document “Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring<br/>
            more content<br/>
            online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.<br/>

            . In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued<br/>
            that no additional licences should be required to mine material<br/>
            to which access has been provided through a subscription<br/>
            agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and<br/>
            data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of<br/>
            a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.<br/>

            User-generated content<br/>

            Technological and service developments mean that citizens can<br/>
            copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial<br/>
            cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are<br/>
            developing rapidly, including the making of<br/>
            so-called“user-generated content”. While users can create<br/>
            totally original content, they can also take one or several<br/>
            pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload<br/>
            the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs53<br/>

            A typical example couldbe the “kitchen” or “wedding” video<br/>
            (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound recording), or<br/>
            adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other<br/>
            examples are “mash-ups” (blending two sound recordings), and<br/>
            reproducing parts of journalistic work(report, review etc.) in<br/>
            a blog.<br/>

            . User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification<br/>
            of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded"<br/>
            work does not necessarily require a creative effortand results<br/>
            from merely adding, subtracting orassociating some pre-existing<br/>
            content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity<br/>
            is not “new” as such. However, the development of social<br/>
            networking and social media sites that enable users to share<br/>
            content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities<br/>
            and increased the potential economic impact for those holding<br/>
            rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the<br/>
            preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With<br/>
            the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-useis<br/>
            open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with<br/>
            regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and<br/>
            the right to property.<br/>

            A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the<br/>
            framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No<br/>
            consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either<br/>
            the problems to be addressed or the results or even the<br/>
            definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were<br/>
            presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon.One<br/>
            view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in<br/>
            particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as<br/>
            combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of<br/>
            photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is<br/>
            needed:UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are<br/>
            increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between<br/>
            rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded<br/>
            between rightholders and the users generating the content. In<br/>
            any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content<br/>
            and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by<br/>
            rightholders across different sectors as a result of the<br/>
            “Licences for Europe” discussions54<br/>

            Private copying and reprography<br/>

            Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their<br/>
            national legislation exceptions or limitations to<br/>
            thereproduction right for copies made for private use and<br/>
            photocopying55<br/>

            Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.<br/>

            . Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods<br/>
            typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording<br/>
            equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such<br/>
            as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating<br/>
            rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made<br/>
            without their authorisation by certain categories of persons<br/>
            (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or<br/>
            through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that<br/>
            context, levies are important for rightholders.<br/>

            With the constant developments in digital technology, the<br/>
            question arises as to whether the copying of files by<br/>
            consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g.<br/>
            when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store<br/>
            multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and<br/>
            her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the<br/>
            application of privatecopying levies. It is argued that, in<br/>
            some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders<br/>
            whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider<br/>
            already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could<br/>
            potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies<br/>
            could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees56<br/>

            Europe", COM(2012) 529 final.<br/>

            These issues were addressed in the recommendations of Mr António<br/>
            Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private copying and<br/>
            reprography levies. You can consult these recommendations on<br/>

            There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or<br/>
            not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as<br/>
            personal lockers or personal video recorders.<br/>

            In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the<br/>

            Diverging national systems levy different products and apply<br/>
            different tariffs. This resultsin obstacles to the free<br/>
            circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the<br/>
            same time, many Member States continue to allow the<br/>
            indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all<br/>
            transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product<br/>
            subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In<br/>
            that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption<br/>
            and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these<br/>
            situations and reduce the number of undue payments61<br/>

            Fair remuneration of authors and performers<br/>

            The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performersa<br/>
            number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose<br/>
            performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There<br/>
            are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing<br/>
            thetransferof rights fromauthors or performers to producers62<br/>

            See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).<br/>

            or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or<br/>
            other subject matter is created in the context of an employment<br/>
            contract63<br/>

            See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive<br/>
            96/9/EC.<br/>

            . Thisis an area that has been traditionally left for Member<br/>
            States to regulate and there are significant differences in<br/>
            regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist<br/>
            between different sectors of the creative industries.<br/>

            Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are<br/>
            not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as<br/>
            regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic<br/>
            benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared<br/>
            along the whole value chain. Another commonly raised issue<br/>
            concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,<br/>
            presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the<br/>
            lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders<br/>
            are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice<br/>
            to improve their situation and that action at EU level is<br/>
            necessary.<br/>

            [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best<br/>

            Respect for rights<br/>

            Directive 2004/48/EE64<br/>

            Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and ofthe<br/>
            Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual<br/>
            property rights.<br/>

            provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of<br/>
            intellectual property rights, including copyright and related<br/>
            rights. The Commission has consulted broadly onthis text65<br/>

            You will find more information on the following<br/>
            website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm<br/>

            . Concerns have beenraised as to whether some of its provisions<br/>
            are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the<br/>
            digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be<br/>
            insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the<br/>
            dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other<br/>
            hand, there are concerns about the current balance between<br/>
            enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental<br/>
            rights, in particular the right for a private life and data<br/>
            protection. While it cannot be contested that enforcement<br/>
            measures should always be available in case of infringement of<br/>
            copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for<br/>
            copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial<br/>
            purpose66<br/>

            For example when the infringing contentis offered on a website<br/>
            which gets advertising revenues that depend on the volume of<br/>
            traffic.<br/>

            . One means to do this could be to clarify the role of<br/>
            intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67<br/>

            This clarification should not affect the liability regime of<br/>
            intermediary service providers established by Directive<br/>
            2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.<br/>

            . At the same time, there could be clarification of the<br/>
            safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for<br/>
            private users.<br/>

            Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more<br/>
            efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a<br/>
            commercial purpose?<br/>

            In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to<br/>
            allow for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as<br/>
            Internet service providers, advertisingbrokers, payment service<br/>
            providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online<br/>
            copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what<br/>

            A single EU Copyright Title<br/>

            The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been<br/>
            present in the copyright debate for quite some time now,<br/>
            although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an<br/>
            objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would<br/>
            totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and<br/>
            replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title<br/>
            instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the<br/>
            only manner in which a truly Single Market for content<br/>
            protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe<br/>
            that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing<br/>
            a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain<br/>
            degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal<br/>
            systems.<br/>

            Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright<br/>
            Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for<br/>
            rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a<br/>
            single framework for enforcement?<br/>
